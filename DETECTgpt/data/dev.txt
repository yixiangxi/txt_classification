 The electoral college is a system in which citizens of the United States elect their president. The system is widely debated, with some people arguing that it works well and others arguing that it is flawed. In this essay, I will argue that the electoral college does work.  First, the electoral college ensures that the president is elected by the entire nation, not just by one particular region. This is important because it ensures that the president understands and represents the needs of the whole country, not just the needs of a specific group of people. For example, a candidate who only appeals to urban voters may not be the best choice for the country as a whole.  Second, the electoral college gives smaller states more power than larger states. This is important because it ensures that the voices of all citizens, not just those in large urban areas, are heard. Smaller states may have more important issues than larger states, and it is essential that they are given a voice in the decision-making process.  Third, the electoral college prevents a candidate from winning the election simply by winning in a few large states. This is important because it ensures that the candidate who truly has the support of the nation is the one who wins the election. A candidate who wins in a few large states but loses in smaller states may not have the support of the majority of the country.  Finally, the electoral college provides a clear and decisive way of deciding who wins the election. This is important because it ensures that the decision is final and that there is no ongoing debate about who won the election.  In conclusion, the electoral college does work. It ensures that the president is elected by the entire nation, gives smaller states more power than larger states, prevents a candidate from winning by winning in a few large states, and provides a clear and decisive way of deciding the election. These factors are important and should be taken into consideration when debating the electoral college.		1
Hey, so I'm supposed to write an essay on the benefits of having longer holidays, a year-round school schedule, and more frequent breaks from school. I'm like, totally stoked to be doing this because I love breaks! üòÉ  So, let's start with longer holidays. I think it's super important to have more time off from school because it helps us recharge our batteries and come back to class feeling refreshed and ready to learn. Like, I mean, who doesn't love having an extra week off in the summer to hang out with their BFFs, go to the beach, or binge-watch their favorite TV shows? It's like, totally necessary for our mental health! üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄ ?  And don't even get me started on a year-round school schedule. I know some people might think it's weird, but I think it's like, totally cool! It would be so much easier to balance school and extracurriculars if we had breaks throughout the year. Plus, it would be way more fun to have a shorter summer and still get to enjoy the pool, movies, and amusement parks without feeling like we're missing out on school. üé¢  And omg, breaks from work and studies are like, totally important too! It's like, so easy to get burnt out from working or studying all the time, and taking a break gives you time to relax and reset. You can come back to work or school feeling refreshed and motivated, and ready to tackle whatever challenges come your way. It's like, totally necessary for our mental health and productivity! üí™  Oh, and let's not forget about strengthening family relationships! Taking breaks together can be like, totally bonding time. Whether it's going to the pool, having a movie night, or going to amusement parks, it's like, so much fun to spend quality time with your fam and create memories that will last a lifetime. It's like, totally important for our emotional well-being! üíï  So, yeah, I'm totally on board with having longer holidays, a year-round school schedule, and		1
I think you should have to have a certain grade to play sports, because of several reasons. It will set a bad example, and it won't always get you somewhere.  It will set a bad example, because the people who do make good grades and play sports will think they don't have to try as hard in school. They will slack off and probably be held back, and not go to college. They will think because someone else can do it and still play the fun sports then so can they.  It won't get them anywhere. People who play sports would probably think they could get a free ride to college with a sports scholarship. Except without there good grades they won't make it nowhere.  This is why i think you should have to make a B average to play sports. Life wouldn't be very easy. More and more people would end up broke and living in a box or in there parents basement. So making them try would save a lot of people.		0
Dear principal,  I know you may be thinking that students should be required to perform community service. I believe that community service is a great way to help out the community, and is a very good way to teach people about the community and how to help the community.  With community service you are able to get a better reputation with you teachers, the people in your community, you athletic coaches and many other people, and having a good reputation is just like knowing the person as well as you know your family, but it is with someone you have just met.  Many people in the younger grades, like first grade through fourth grade, don't know what community service.  You are probably thinking why have the younger grades do community service, which i completely understand, they don't have to participate in the activities but they could at least be taught what it is and how they could help at such a young age.  The young years in there life is when they soak up the most knowledge and should be taught what is and how they can help out and work in the community.  Community service is a must in my book.  I also know that in most high schools it is required that you do a certain amount of hours every year, so what better time to start then when you are young and still learning.  As kids grow up to be teens and young adults they should have all of the knowledge that they need to participate in service activities. Whether it is working at a local school or local soup kitchen you should be able to pitch at least an hour of there time into helping other people out.  I know this is your decision but if you would just put this letter in to consideration i would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you for taking time into reading my letter.  I really appreciate your time.      		0

The Facial Action Coding System is a pretty cool thing. It can detect what emotion a person is feeling just by looking at their face! It's like having a magic camera that can see how you're feeling. Some people think it would be a good idea to use this technology in classrooms to see how students are feeling. But is it really a good idea?  One good thing about using the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is that it could help teachers understand their students better. If a teacher knows how their students are feeling, they can adjust their teaching methods to help the students learn better. For example, if a student is feeling confused, the teacher could explain the material in a different way to help them understand.  Another good thing about this technology is that it could help students who have trouble expressing their emotions. Some students might be shy or have a hard time talking about how they're feeling. The Facial Action Coding System could help the teacher identify how these students are feeling, even if they don't say anything.  But there are also some bad things about using this technology in classrooms. One bad thing is that it could be a distraction. If the camera is always watching the students, they might get distracted and not pay attention to the lesson. It's like having a big brother watching you all the time, it could make you feel uncomfortable.  Another bad thing is that it could be an invasion of privacy. Students might not want their emotions to be monitored all the time. It's like having someone read your mind, it's not a good feeling. And what if the camera gets it wrong? What if it thinks a student is feeling something they're not? That could be really embarrassing.  In conclusion, using the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms could be helpful in some ways, but it could also be a distraction and an invasion of privacy. It's not a good idea to use this technology in classrooms. It's better to just ask the students how they're feeling and let them express themselves in their own way.		1
  As citizens of our community, we must consider the impact of our daily activities on the environment and our health. One of the most significant contributors to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions is the use of cars. Therefore, it is essential to limit car usage and explore alternative transportation options.  One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is a reduction in air pollution. According to the passage set, "Car-free cities" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, "Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has . . . [a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters." (Source 2) By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease the amount of air pollution in our community.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. As Rosenthal states in "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" by Andrew Selsky, "Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. 'These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,' said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunci√≥n, Paraguay." (Source 4) By promoting alternative transportation options, such as biking and public transportation, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to the global effort to combat climate change.  However, some may argue that limiting car usage will negatively impact the economy. According to Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, "Personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable."		1
Students, if given the chance, would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. A large portion of kids all over the world struggle to go to school because of various scenarios and responsibilities that prevent them from going to school. Whether the problem be a disability, large distances, a dangerous environment, or problems in their own life, people may need a method of education that can work anywhere and anytime.  Many students may live in areas where technology is scarce or has a lack of constructed buildings, so their designated school may be far away from their house. This leaves them with two traveling opportunities: take transportation or go by foot. In many cases, though, these places tend to not have any metros, roads, or even have anything like bikes to ride. This changes the choice to "Should I go, or should I not?", as it may well not even be worth it to traverse to their destination for hours just to walk back afterwards. If we were to start having online classes, they would be able to communicate with their teachers efficiently as long as they had electronics.  For those who are severely injured, or quarantined in their room from being sick, they're likely to be stuck at home as a means of preventing the reopening of wounds or getting others at school sick. With the help of technology, they can still attend their classes without falling behind on late work they would have missed out on without worrying that they might spread their disease or put themselves in risk of getting injured again. Even if it's not a disability that keeps them away from school, there may be family responsibilities, especially for those in the poorer classes. These responsibilities may range from helping their family business, taking care of their younger siblings, doing all of the house work to relief stress for their parents, or any family member being in the hospital, these can be random and often times sporadic for those who struggle in terms of income. These are usually resposibilities they cannot say no to, and so being able to take classes via the internet allows them to multitask and not have to give up their education.  Most people believe, however,¬†that those who want online classes are just using it as an excuse to be lazy, or so that they may slack off without the teacher seeing. While they may be true for some, the danger is real. Even if school is maybe a ten or so minute walk, or you have a bus stop nearby, parents have realized that in that short amount of time, you may get lost or attacked. Cities are a prime example of a dangerous environment for children and teens alike. Thee may be a lot of dark alleyways or corners on a student's route to school, and they can early be robbed or kidnapped at each turn. There has also been an influx of school shootings, in which people would rather stay in the safety of their own home than go to school. During extreme weather and natural disasters, school chooses to cancel school or have an early dismissal so that the students arent endangered, which wouldn't be a problem if we had our classes online instead. With online classes, students would be able to ask questions during the weekend, or while caved in by a snowstorm.  When looking at a small scale, like a single county or school, it may look like everyone's attending and keeping up with their grades, but when looked upon at a larger scale, like other states and even countries, it's obvious that there's a huge problem. Many people worldwide decide whether they like it or not, that they do not have the time or means to go to school everyday, which comes back to haunt them in the future when they go looking for a job. With the support of online classes and video conferencing, we could provide everyone with a solution¬†to this dilemma.		0
 When the average cowboy thinks of the ocean, they probably picture the vast, open space, and the wildness that can come with it. However, one cowboy rode the waves differently, challenging the traditional image of the rugged cowboy. His name was Duke Kahanamoku, and he used his cowboy skills on the water, as he became one of the greatest surfers of all time.   Kahanamoku was born in Hawaii, and was heavily influenced by the island's rich traditions and culture. As a child, Kahanamoku spent much of his time surfing the waves on the north shore of Oahu. It was here that his talent for surfing began to flourish, and he quickly gained recognition for his abilities.   As he became older, Kahanamoku's reputation as a surfer continued to grow, and he eventually became known as the "Father of Modern Surfing." He organized surfing contests and exhibitions, and helped to popularize the sport with audiences around the world.   While Kahanamoku's contributions to surfing are well known, it's important to remember that he was also a cowboy. He trained as a rodeo cowboy in his early years, and he was known for his expertise in rope work and his skill on horseback.   Kahanamoku's dual identity as both a cowboy and a surfer is what makes him such a unique and inspiring figure. He proved that it's possible to embrace and excel in multiple disciplines, and he showed the world that the rugged cowboy stereotype wasn't always accurate.   In conclusion, Duke Kahanamoku was a true icon who defied convention and showed the world that it's possible to be a cowboy and a surfer. His contributions to both sports are immeasurable, and he remains a beloved and inspiring figure in Hawaiian culture and beyond. If you're ever feeling like life has thrown you on your back and you're about to give up, just think of Duke Kahanamoku, and remember that the ocean is full of waves waiting to be ridden. Like a cowboy, you too can rise to the challenge and find happiness and success.		1
 The cowboy who rode the waves was a lone figure in the vastness of the sea, his horse tearing through the water as he gripped the reins tightly. He had spent years honing his skills as a cowboy, mastering the art of wrangling cattle across the plains. But today, he had chosen to trade his six-shooter for a fishing rod, and his lasso for a fishing net.  As he rode the waves, his hat flew off his head, and the wind whipped his hair back. The sun was setting on the horizon, casting golden rays across the water, and the sky was painted with shades of pink, orange, and purple. The cowboy had always loved the beauty of the sea, and today was no exception.  He had been a cowboy for as long as he could remember. He grew up on a ranch in the desert, where he would spend his days playing with his brothers and sisters, and riding his horse across the plains. As he grew older, he began to learn the ways of the cowboy. He learned how to rope a cow and drive it through the gates, how to sit astride his horse for hours, and how to ride through the rough terrain of the plains.  But as time went on, the cowboy began to feel like there was more to life than just cattle ranching. He had heard stories of brave cowboys who had braved the waves, and he knew that he had to give it a try. So he sold his ranch, packed his bags, and set sail for the ocean.  It was a difficult transition. The cowboy was used to the open plains and the wide-open sky, and the sea seemed like a completely foreign world to him. He had never been more than a hundred feet from the shore, and suddenly he found himself out on the open water, surrounded by nothing but water and the wind.  But the cowboy never lost his sense of adventure. He spent his days fishing, casting his net and waiting for the fish to come. As he stood on the back of his horse, he could feel the sea rushing past him, carrying him on its waves. He felt alive, invigorated by the vastness of the ocean and the thrill of the chase.  As the sun began to set, the cowboy rode the waves back to shore, his horse exhausted but still eager for more. He knew that he would spend the rest of his days exploring the sea, discovering new fish and new wonders that lay beneath the surface. He was a cowboy who had ridden the waves, and he knew that there was no going back.		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME  I do not think that you should make all students perform community service it should be a optional thing. The reason it is optional is because some people just don't have the time. Take me for example i have to go home after school grab a quick bite to eat then i have to go play basketball or go to the gym. I used to even have to babysit. Other kids also have this problem that they don't have enough time to do any of this because of babysitting a lot of kids in our school have little brother and/or sisters and have to babysit after school. Witch makes it impossible to go do community service because by the time our parents get home we have to eat dinner then go do our homework and its already night time. Also it should be optional because some people just don't care about community service. Like when i say this i mean it nicely but i don't care about community service in my neighborhood all it is to me is more work and responsibilities i have to do. I would much rather hang out with my friends everyday and have a very fun athletic and social life. Then to go to community service everyday and just work. I know how bad it sucks to have community service because when i had to do 150 hours of it for court i hated it. I had to get up in the morning on my weekends and go work for hours and i get nothing out of it but some trash picked up off the ground witch wouldn't bother me even if it was there. So giving kids requirements to do community service would not be fair, but there is kids out there that for some odd reason like to do this so i think you should just have a sign up sheet and hold meetings about coming to community service on certain days to help out the community once in a while and the kids that want to help can help and the kids that have things to do and have plans to hang out with people and sleep out or have someone sleep in should not have to do it if they do not want to. I also think that if kids do sign up you can like bring them on a trip or two and have special meetings with them in school were they can get out of class like once or twice a month to just go eat like pizza or ice cream or even just to hang out and talk while using our phones and ipods. The reason i say this is because you will get more kids to sign up like the kids like me who will do it just to get out of class and socialize more because we are always finding newer and better ways to socialize and not get in trouble. Plus why not reward us for wanting to help out the community and for helping out the school and all the other people in the community. But no matter what community service should never be force on a kid for school it should only be forced on when they get in trouble with the law but i don't think even then but that will never change so it don't matter. so please do not make us all have community service just have a sign up sheet and the people who come can get special rewards and treats other students don't get.

 The future is now. With the development of the Facial Action Coding System, computers can now identify human emotions. But is this a useful application of technology? Should this system be used in a classroom setting? In this essay, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, and ultimately decide whether it is a valuable use of technology or not.  The use of the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom would give teachers access to a powerful tool. By understanding the emotional state of their students, teachers could adjust their teaching methods to better reach their students. For example, if a teacher were to see that a student was confused or frustrated, they could take the time to explain the material differently or offer additional resources to help the student understand. This would be especially helpful for teachers working with students who have special needs or learning disabilities.  However, there are also potential drawbacks to this technology. One of the biggest concerns is privacy. The Facial Action Coding System raises concerns about how this data will be used and who will have access to it. Will it be used to track student progress and improvement? Or will it be used to punish students who are not paying attention or who are misbehaving? There is also the potential for data to be shared with third parties without the consent of the students or their parents.  Another concern is the accuracy of the Facial Action Coding System. While the technology has come a long way, it is still not perfect. There is a risk that the system could misinterpret the emotional state of a student, leading to incorrect assessments of their progress and needs. This could have serious consequences, such as a student being incorrectly placed in a special education program or being denied the resources they need to succeed.  In conclusion, the use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a complex issue with both advantages and disadvantages. While the technology has the potential to be a valuable tool for teachers, there are also serious concerns about privacy and accuracy that must be considered. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to use this technology in the classroom should be made carefully, taking into account the potential benefits and risks.   As this progress continues and technology advances, we must always keep in mind the big picture and decide which technologies benefit us, and which ones go too far. 		1
 Introduction:  Venus is an important planet in our solar system that has fascinated scientists and adventurers alike. Despite the dangers that come with exploring the planet, many believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. In the essay "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author presents arguments in support of this idea.  Body:  The author discusses the various reasons why studying Venus is worthwhile, such as its proximity to the Earth and its similarity to our planet in several ways. For example, he points out that Venus has a thick atmosphere, which makes it similar to the Earth, and it is also covered by volcanoes and mountain ranges, which can be studied by scientists studying the planet. Additionally, the author notes that studying Venus can help scientists gain a better understanding of the origins of the solar system, as well as the conditions that led to the formation of life on Earth.  The author also acknowledges the dangers of exploring Venus, including the extreme temperatures and pressures that exist on the planet, as well as the possibility of encountering deadly hazards such as sulfuric acid and toxic radiation. However, he suggests that despite these dangers, the knowledge that can be gained from studying Venus is too important to ignore.  Despite the risks, the author also argues that exploring Venus is a necessary step in our ongoing quest to explore the universe. He points out that understanding the conditions that led to the formation of life on Earth can help us better understand the possibilities of life existing elsewhere in the universe, and studying Venus can provide us with valuable insights into the potential for life on other planets.  Conclusion:  In conclusion, the author provides a strong argument for why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He points out the numerous benefits that can be gained from studying Venus, including a better understanding of the solar system, the origins of life on Earth, and the potential for life on other planets. While the risks associated with exploring Venus cannot be ignored, the knowledge that can be gained from studying the planet makes it a necessary step in our ongoing quest to explore the universe. Overall, the author effectively supports the claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.		1
Dear Senator...  The electoral college has recently been a very controversial topic in the world of politics. Many believe that it's a significant system, that's why the Founding Fathers created it, while others argue that it doesn't necessarily work as well. The Electoral College is a process in which there is an agreement between the president's election by a vote in Congress and the president's election by a popular vote made by the citizens. There should be a change in the system into changing election by a popular vote since the Electoral College is not only an outdated system, but it gives the citizens no control over who Congress will be picking.  To start off, the process of the Electoral College should be changed since it's an outdated system. As stated in "In Defense of the Electoral College" it says "The Electoral College is widely regarded as anachroism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner." Even the article that seems to be favoring the electoral college introduced it as so. It can be seen that it is a process that has been around since America itself, but America has constantly been changing and innovating and it needs a more flexible system to cast the votes. In "What is the Electoral College"? it states that "THE FOUNDING FATHERS ESTABLISHED IT IN THE CONSTITUTION AS QA COMPROMISE" HENCE THIS IS STATING THAT THE SYSTEM WAS CREATED A LONG TIME AGO AND IT NEEDS SOME CHANGES.  TO CONTINUE, THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ALTERED SINCE IT DOESN'T GIVE THE CITIZENS ALOT OF CONTROL AS TO WHO THE CONGRESS WILL BE PICKING. IN "THE INDEFENSIBLE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, IT SAYS THAT 'THE SINGLE BEST ARGUMENT AGAINST THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE DISASTER FACTOR." WHAT THIS IS, IS THAT THE VOTERS HAVE NO CONTROL WHOM THE ELECTORS VOTE FOR. AS WELL, IN THE SAME ARTICLE, IT STATES THAT "AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL, THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS UNFAIR TO VOTERS. BECAUSE OF THE WINNER TAKE ALL SYSTEM IN EACH STATE, CANDIDATES DON'T SPEND TIME IN STATES THEY KNOW THEY HAVE NO CHNACE OF WINNING." WHAT ALL THIS SAYS IS THAT, THE VOTERS HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS PICKING, AND IT SHOULD BE CHANGED TO ANOTHER SYSTEM.  TO CONCLUDE, THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM SHOULD BE ALTERED TO A NEW SYSETM WHICH IS FAIR AND MORE TRUSTFUL TO THE VOTERS. NOT ONLY IS THE SYSTEM OUTDADE, BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE THE VOTERS ALOT OF CONTROL. A NEW SYSTEM SHOULD BE INTRODUCED. ALTHOUGH MANY AGREE THAT IT SHOULD BE CHANGED, ALSO SOME BELIEVE IT SHOULD STAY HOW IT IS. THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ALTERED, SO THIS WAY, THE PEOPLE HAVE THE VOICE, NOT ONLY THE GOVERNMENT.		0
What i think about having cell phones at school is that you should let us have phones, because you need to call someone to bring something important to you like text books for a class. Also why i say its a good idea to have cell phones at school is that you can use them on your free time and use them in case of a emergency, like you have to call your mom to tell her that your going to your friends house after school. If students were to use their phones in class then they will get it taken away and will get it back by signing a contract stating that he or she will never use their phone in class ever again, but if they do use their phone again they will get it taken away for the whole day and their parent have to come pick it up. So that's why i think it would be a good idea if you could have cell phones at school.		0
Advice is something many people may need. Some people may seek advice from family members or friends. Some may see advice from complete strangers. Advice can come from anywhere! All and all as long as the advice is beneficial that is all that matters. Some people choose to get dvice from multiple sources because many people have different beliefs, different opions, and different life experiences.  The first reason why people get advice from many sources is because people have different beliefs. Not everyone believes the same thing! With that being said, having someone that can can give advice, that has a different belief can be a very good idea. People that have different beliefs may also have a different point of view. Due to their beliefs they might have different outlook on the situation at hand. These are some of the reasons why some people may get advice from someone with a different belief.  The second reason why people get advice from multiple sources is becuse some people may have different opinions. When asking for advice from multiple sources, most likely you are not going to get the same solution. Only because everyone is entitled to their own opinion. This may make it very hard to come to a solution but it is very beneficial because it puts things into perspective. This also gives an oppurtunity to approach the problem in different manners. These are the reasons why someone may get advice from multiple sources.  The last reason why people may get advice from many sources is because people have different life experiences. Many people have been through many different things throughout their life. When asking for advice people may connect the situation to a previous or current problem in their life. While their giving their advice it may alter your thought process. It might could even dictate your solution. These are reasons why people get advice from people with different life experiences.  There are may more reasons why people get advice from multiple sources. These are just some of the reasons. When getting advice from others them having diferent beliefs, different opinions, and different life experiences is very important. These things play a key role when coming to a solution.¬†¬†		0
**A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves**  I've always been a cowboy. I grew up on a ranch in Texas, and I spent my days riding horses, herding cattle, and fixing fences. But when I was 16 years old, I had the chance to do something that no other cowboy had ever done before: I went on a seagoing cattle drive.  The Seagoing Cowboys program is a unique opportunity for young people to experience the cowboy lifestyle on the open ocean. We traveled from Texas to Alaska, herding cattle across the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. It was an amazing experience, and I learned a lot about myself and about the world.  One of the things I learned is that being a cowboy is more than just riding horses and roping cattle. It's also about teamwork, perseverance, and a willingness to work hard. On the Seagoing Cowboys program, we had to work together as a team to get the job done. We had to learn how to work in difficult conditions, and we had to be able to trust each other. It was a challenge, but it was also a lot of fun.  Another thing I learned is that the world is a big place. I had never been to Alaska before, and I was amazed by the beauty of the scenery. I saw mountains, glaciers, and forests that I had never seen before. It was an incredible experience, and it made me realize how much I had to learn about the world.  If you're looking for an adventure, I encourage you to consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. It's an experience that you'll never forget.  **Here are some of the reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program:**  * **You'll learn about the cowboy lifestyle.** The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to learn about the cowboy lifestyle.

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This movement is driven by a number of factors, including concerns about the environment, traffic congestion, and public health. There are a number of advantages to limiting car usage.  One advantage is that it can help to reduce air pollution. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and limiting car usage can help to improve air quality. This is especially important in cities, where air pollution can be a serious health hazard.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can help to reduce traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can cause a number of problems, including delays, increased pollution, and stress. Limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion and make it easier to get around.  Finally, limiting car usage can help to improve public health. Walking and biking are good forms of exercise, and they can help to reduce obesity and other health problems. Limiting car usage can encourage people to walk and bike more, which can improve their overall health.  There are a number of ways to limit car usage. One way is to build more public transportation. Public transportation can help people to get around without having to drive a car. Another way to limit car usage is to build more bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly streets. This can make it easier for people to walk and bike, and it can discourage people from driving. Finally, cities can also charge higher parking fees or implement congestion pricing. This can discourage people from driving and encourage them to use other forms of transportation.  Limiting car usage can have a number of benefits for the environment, public health, and traffic congestion. There are a number of ways to limit car usage, and cities can do a number of things to encourage people to use other forms of transportation.		1
Asking for advice is something very resourceful and will help people make better choices .When¬†seeking multiple opinions they can all vary depending on the type of person you speak to. When speaking to a very low profiled person they will most likely give you weak advice. However when speaking to someone well known¬†like a best friend or family member the outcome of the advice will be stronger.  When asking for advice from a very low profiled person the result of their opinion will most likely be weak. Advice is something that has to be helpful and very important because it will guide you to make better choices. You shouldnt ask someone you dont know for advice because of the their lack of knowledge about you. It's like asking a stranger how to get along with your parents,they wouldnt know how to respond but will most likely give you a small tip and say " Just listen to them'' and move on as if they are not concerned. If you take that advice you will realize that it was so dull and that it wasnt helpful at all. This is why you should ask more people and seek more advice. The man who said ''Just listen to them'' was one opinion but there is many more to hear out from that are more valuable.  When asking for advice from a well known person or friend the result of their opinion will be strong. Unlike from a low profiled person or someone well unknown the result of the their opinion will be weak. Asking for advice from a well known person such as family member or friend will have a stronger outcome. The advice will have a stronger outcome because they know you well enough to provide you with what you need. If you are having problems with your parents it is possible that you will ask a best friend or a sibling for advice. Perhaps they will give you a strong tip or will talk further into depth about it. The advice they probably tell you is "Show respect" and "follow directions the first time given" .These tips are very useful so you take the advice and use it. You can see that those tips were more useful than the strangers tips this is why seeking out to multiple opinions of advice can help make better choices.  Asking the close family member gave the most efficient advice because of the knowledge they had for you. Asking someone such as a family member or a best friend for advice is most likely the best choice that you can choose. However when asking a stranger or someone you dont know for advice will give you the least efficient outcome and provide you with the weakest form of advice. The stranger didnt give the best advice because of his lack of knowledge about you.  Talking to more than one person for advice is always the way to go. Talking to more than one person for advice is the best choice, because you can see everyone's¬†perspective on what they see. If you ask one person for advice you can not really compare their opinion to anyone¬†else's. When you see two perspective's there is always two side of the story. When one side is told there is a possibility it can be very dull and useless. When the other side is told it could be the complete opposite and have everything you need in it. This is why seeking more than one opinion of advice is important ,you can compare it to the other opinions you have and conclude it to what you need. This is why talking to more than one person for advice is a better choice than talking to just one.   ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†		0
 Advancements in technology have revolutionized numerous industries, including the automotive industry. One major breakthrough in this field is the development of driverless cars. These vehicles use a combination of sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to function autonomously, without the need for a human driver. In this essay, we will discuss the benefits and challenges of driverless cars, their potential for the future, and how they can affect our daily lives.  One benefit of driverless cars is increased safety. Traditional cars cause a high percentage of accidents due to human error, such as distracted driving, drunk driving, and fatigue. By removing the human element from driving, driverless cars can potentially limit or eliminate these accidents. Additionally, if a problem occurs, such as a flat tire or mechanical issue, the car's sensors will detect it and alert the driver, reducing the risk of accidents.  Another potential benefit of driverless cars is increased accessibility. For individuals without a driver's license, such as the elderly or people with disabilities, driverless cars would provide the freedom to travel independently. Furthermore, individuals who live in rural areas where public transportation may not be available would also have access to driverless cars.  However, there are also challenges to consider in the development of driverless cars. One significant challenge is the cost of the technology required to make the car function autonomously. Additionally, there is the issue of job loss: as driverless cars become more common, there will be fewer jobs available in the transportation industry, particularly in areas such as taxi driving or trucking.  As for the potential for the future, it is clear that driverless cars are already here, and their prevalence is only expected to increase. In the future, driverless cars, with their increased safety and accessibility, could become the norm, changing the way we live and work. It is essential that we continue to address the challenges associated with driverless cars and consider ways to mitigate any negative impacts.  In conclusion, driverless cars represent a significant technological advancement in the automotive industry. They have the potential to increase safety and accessibility for individuals, but it is crucial to address the challenges associated with this new technology to ensure a smooth transition for all. As we continue to refine the technology and implement driverless cars in our daily lives, we must consider the potential impacts on our society and work towards addressing any potential issues before they arise.		1
 Dear principal,  I believe that community service should be mandatory for all students, regardless of whether they are in trouble or not. While some students may argue that they do not have the time or resources to participate in community service, I believe that it is a valuable opportunity to give back to the community and learn valuable skills.  In addition, community service can be a great way for students to develop empathy and understanding for others. By helping out in their community, they can see firsthand the impact that their actions have on others and learn to appreciate the value of hard work and dedication.  Furthermore, community service can be a great way for students to develop leadership skills and take ownership of their actions. By volunteering their time and resources, they can learn to communicate effectively, work collaboratively with others, and take initiative to make a positive impact in their community.  While some people may argue that community service is too much work, I believe that it is not a significant burden. By breaking down the tasks into manageable steps and providing support and resources, students can easily participate in community service and make a positive impact in their community.  In conclusion, I believe that community service should be mandatory for all students, as it provides a valuable opportunity to give back to the community and learn valuable skills. By participating in community service, students can develop empathy, leadership, and other important skills that will serve them well throughout their lives.		1
Dress codes are like super annoying you know? Like, why do we gotta wear like certain clothes just to go to school? It's not like it's gonna make us learn better or anything. I think dress codes are totally pointless and they just need to go.  First of all, dress codes are like, way too strict. Like, we can't even wear ripped jeans or tank tops. That's like, so not fair. We should be able to wear whatever we want, as long as it's not like, super inappropriate or anything. And who's to say what's inappropriate anyways? Like, some people might think a tank top is fine, but others might think it's too revealing. It's all just, like, opinions and stuff.  And secondly, dress codes don't even do anything. Like, they're not gonna make us learn more or be better students. We're still gonna be the same people, no matter what we're wearing. And besides, school is suppose to be about learning, not about what we're wearing. So, why bother with dress codes at all? It's just a total waste of time.  Also, dress codes can be really unfair to some people. Like, if someone can't afford nice clothes, they might get in trouble for not following the dress code. That's just not right. Everyone should be able to wear what they can afford, and not get judged for it. And also, what if someone has a religious or cultural reason for dressing a certain way? They should be able to wear what they want, without getting in trouble.  Lastly, dress codes just take away our individuality. Like, we're all unique people, and we should be able to express ourselves through what we wear. But with dress codes, we're all just, like, the same. It's boring. And, like, who wants to be the same as everyone else? Not me, that's for sure.  So, in conclusion, dress codes are just, like, totally pointless. They're too strict, they don't do anything, they're unfair, and they take away our individuality. We should just, like, get rid of them altogether and be able to wear whatever we want. That would be, like, so much better.		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my opinion on the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and unfair system that should be abolished.  The Electoral College was created in 1787 as a compromise between the large states and the small states. The large states wanted the president to be elected by a popular vote of the people, while the small states wanted each state to have equal representation. The Electoral College was a way to satisfy both sides.  However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary. The United States is now a much more diverse country, and the popular vote is a more accurate way to represent the will of the people. In fact, in the last five presidential elections, the winner of the popular vote has lost the election twice. This is simply not fair to the majority of voters.  There are several reasons why I believe the Electoral College should be abolished. First, it gives too much power to a small number of states. In 2016, Donald Trump won the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. This is because Trump won a few key states by very narrow margins, while Hillary Clinton won by large margins in many other states. This system gives a disproportionate amount of power to a small number of swing states, and it devalues the votes of people in other states.  Second, the Electoral College discourages voter participation. People who live in states that are considered to be "safe" for one party or the other often feel like their votes don't matter. This is because the outcome of the election is already decided in their state. In 2016, for example, there were over 100 million people who voted in the presidential election, but over 40 million of those votes were essentially meaningless because they were cast in states that were already decided.  Third, the Electoral College is undemocratic. The popular vote is a more accurate way to represent the will of the people. In a democracy, the majority should rule. The Electoral College allows a minority of voters to elect the president, which is simply not fair.  I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College. It is an outdated and unfair system that needs to be replaced with a system that is more democratic and fair to all voters.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
Dear. Principal  I think that your idea is good but very unfair. Cause there is students that always try there best and do there best that can play sports but just don't have a B average. At the same time your idea is good but then what about the students that never get to play sports because of there grades and everything. I mean great students do good grades and keep everything in place . So you could give them a change to play a sport by telling them if they get on the team they have to bring there grades up, or there out, you could tell them that. Some would even do anything to bring there grades up to a B average and be on there favorite team of sports.  Your idea is great because maybe that way some students bring up there grades and do better in school but sometimes you just have to give them changes to play in that sports so they can do better. Like lets say this student wants to play really bad so they bring there grades up and they play, but them there grades come down and they get kick off the team, they feel bad!! So Mrs. principal i like your idea cause maybe that way the students bring there grades up and do better and always have a better future. So for me anyway or another your idea has a good side and a bad side. Its just matter of fact what the students do. If they do anything to be on a sport team then they should bring up there grades and always keep a B average!  They can always participate and make part of a group but they always have to keep there grades up. Better grades for all students is just great cause that way they can always participate in clubs, and sports. So i would feel good if you took the time to look at my opinion and think about it. So anyway or another i like the idea but sometimes you have to think about the other students, you can always help them, so they can bring there grades up. Well that's the way i think, that's what i would do if i was principal of a school. Always tell them to try there best to get to the point where they feel good about them self's.  For me good grades in school bring a better life and future for us. So for them students out there that want to play any kind of sport, bring up your grades, everyone can do it, if you try your best!		0
[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP] [Email Address] [Phone Number] [Date]  [Senator's Name] [Address] [City, State, ZIP]  Subject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College  Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],  I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College intact for the election of the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe the Electoral College provides several crucial benefits that outweigh the perceived disadvantages.  Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. In the event of a dispute over the election results, the Electoral College method reduces the likelihood of prolonged legal battles. As stated in "In Defense of the Electoral College" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote, creating a clear and decisive result. This system avoids uncertainty and helps maintain stability in our democratic process.  Secondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As outlined in Judge Posner's article, no single region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This motivates candidates to campaign on a national scale, listening to the concerns and interests of citizens across the country. This approach ensures that the elected president represents the diverse needs of all Americans, rather than being limited to regional interests.  Thirdly, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in swing states promotes engagement and participation in the political process. As mentioned in Judge Posner's article, these swing states become the focus of campaign efforts, and voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the candidates and the issues. This system encourages thoughtful voting and ensures that the most engaged citizens have a significant role in deciding the outcome.  Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance by granting more weight to larger states. As described by Judge Posner, the mal-apportionment of the Senate favors smaller states, and the Electoral College provides a mechanism to offset this disparity. This ensures that presidential candidates consider the concerns and needs of citizens in both large and small states, preventing any imbalance of representation.  Lastly, by maintaining the Electoral College, we avoid the complex logistics of run-off elections. Elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote can lead to run-off contests, which could further complicate the presidential election process. The Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, minimizing any need for run-off elections and ensuring a smooth transition of power.  While there are critics who argue that the winner-take-all system of the Electoral College can lead to the disenfranchisement of voters in non-swing states, it is important to note that voter turnouts remain high, as mentioned in Judge Posner's article. The Electoral College does not deter individuals from participating in the election; rather, it allows voters to express their political preferences and helps maintain the integrity of the process.  In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty, encourages national appeal, promotes engagement, restores balance, and avoids run-off elections. These benefits outweigh the arguments for a popular vote system. Let us continue to uphold the Electoral College as a vital component of our democratic process.  Thank you for considering my viewpoint. I hope that you will take these factors into account when making decisions regarding the future of the Electoral College.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Dear Senator,  Concerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is "an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner." (Posner) Though the lack of control over the president of the United States' election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner.  Foremost, the EC as a method of back-up to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid; however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter's representation. As each citizen votes, he/she votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Richard Posner in his publication "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President," states that, "it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote." However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, "yet, that has happened very rarely." Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a "winner-take-all" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one's ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts his/her vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body.  The Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from his/her presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that "the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population." There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, "practical" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, "the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election," morally, his reasoning is spot-on. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society he/she lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for his/her representatives; pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that "only educated voters should decide the election," simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined.  Large states also play a role in the EC's inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of mal-apportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state's population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation.  Understanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and co-ordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally. For the reasons provided theretofore, we strongly urge a negation of the Electoral college in favour of a more accurate voting method.  Yours,  PROPER_NAME    		0
Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great experience. You don't only help people, but you also get a benefit of seeing amazing places. If you love animals you can take care of them. You get to have fun and know that you're doing something that helps others.  Luke was just a small town boy and he got a great opportunity. First he had two part-time jobs at a grocery store and a bank. Luke was invited to be a Seagoing Cowboy by his friend Don. He accepted it and knew he was going to have a lifetime opportunity. Luke had a benefit of seeing Europe and China, saw the Acropolis in Greece, took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.  This job may be fun, but it still is a life changing experience. You see more than you could see just from home. You also know you're changing other people's lives. Luke may have had a wonderous adventure, but it also made him more aware of the needs in other countries.		0
Should Cell Phones be Allowed in School?  Do you think phones should be allowed during free time in school? I think this should be something children should be able to do. If i was the principal of a school I would allow children to bring their phone devices because they might have to communicate with their parents. Some reasons why i would allow students to use their phones during lunch and other free times are they might need to get in contact with there parents if they need something or have an emergency and, it is a way to become a social person. I would only allow students to do this if their phones were turned off at all other times. I would hope students would be responsible to only use phones when allowed.  Image you were in school and you needed to get in contact with your parents desperately and, you couldn't wait until you got home but, to make it even worse you couldn't use your phone. I would feel very unconstrained and i would not be able to focus for the rest of the day. I think I would not be able to do my work or, anything that involves deep thought. But none of that would ever have to happen if you were able to use your phone. You would be able to get in contact with them and be worry free for the rest of your school day. That is an easy way to get stress of your back.  Another reason why students should be able to use their cellular devices during free time is they can become a social person. Although you may use your phone a lot out of school you can become more social in school. Say if you meet someone new and you want to exchange phone numbers but no one has paper to write each others phone numbers on. If you had your phone you can exchange phone numbers very fast. It would only take you a minute and, right there you have a new phoned number. This can make you more social because you get to meet new people in school and, you wouldn't have to meet out of school. Plus the more you might text someone the closer of friends you may become.  I think these two reasons are why a principle should allow their students to use their phones during lunch and free time. It would make people get in contact with their parents when needed and, you can make new friends. I would have faith in my students that they wouldn't use their phones during class periods. So if you were principle of a school would you allow your students to use their phones?		0
Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  Limiting car usage has become an increasingly important issue as the negative impacts of cars on the environment and public health become more evident. This essay will explore the advantages of reducing car usage, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and improvements in air quality, as well as the promotion of alternative transportation methods and the creation of more accessible and livable communities.  One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). By reducing car usage, we can make a substantial impact on reducing these emissions and combatting climate change. This is especially important considering the ambitious goals set by President Obama to curb greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. By driving less and using alternative transportation methods, we can contribute to achieving these goals and creating a more sustainable future.  Furthermore, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on air quality. The smog and pollution caused by car emissions have become a major concern in many cities around the world. For example, Paris recently enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution caused by car emissions (Duffer). By reducing car usage, we can improve air quality and create healthier environments for everyone. This is particularly important in densely populated areas where high levels of pollution can have detrimental effects on public health.  In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage also promotes the use of alternative transportation methods. Car-free communities, like Vauban in Germany, show that it is possible to live without cars and rely on public transportation and other alternatives (Rosenthal). By encouraging the use of bikes, buses, and trains, we can reduce traffic congestion and improve the efficiency of transportation systems. This not only benefits the environment but also provides a more sustainable and accessible way for people to commute and travel.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is the creation of more accessible and livable communities. Traditional suburban areas have long been dependent on cars, with homes designed around the need for ample parking space and easy access to highways (Rosenthal). However, this car-centric design has led to sprawling developments and contributed to urban sprawl. By promoting the concept of smart planning, with compact communities and accessible public transportation, we can create more walkable and bike-friendly neighborhoods. This promotes physical activity, reduces traffic congestion, and creates a sense of community.  In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages both for individuals and society as a whole. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality, we can contribute to tackling climate change and creating healthier environments. Additionally, promoting alternative transportation methods and creating more accessible communities can lead to better transportation systems and livable neighborhoods. It is important for individuals and policymakers to recognize and support the advantages of limiting car usage in order to create a more sustainable and equitable future.		1
The principal has made a decision saying all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I do not agree with this decision. The principal should not be able to decide what students must do after school. For example, many students have things they must do after school and if the principal requires students to do extracurricular activities after school, they might not be able to complete what they need to do. So, I do not think the principals decision to require students to do extracurricular activities is the right decision because students may have homework they need to complete, they may have chores to do at home, or they may have a job such as babysitting or dog walking.  Every student has at least one teacher that gives them homework. Some students have multiple teachers that give them homework. Either way, you need to complete what your teacher assigns you. If students are required to do an extracurricular activity, they might not have time to complete all their homework. This may cause students to get behind in there classes and when the time for a test comes they might not be prepared because of the lack of practice. If students start failing there classes and getting behind in work, they may never catch up or have a extremely difficult time catching up. If students care about school they would stress about being behind or failing a certain class. They wouldn't have time to hang out with friends or have a social life because they would just be sitting at home studying or trying to catch up in school.  A lot of kids have chores to do. These chores may include: washing the dishes, doing the laundry, taking out the trash, or cleaning the house. Some kids have one chore to complete, some kids have multiple. Whatever the chore may be, kids should always be completing the task they are required to do. If students are required to do extracurricular activities they might not have enough time to complete their chores. If students have multiple chores to do, it might take them a couple hours to complete. If students get home later then they would normally, they would have less time to complete the task at hand. If students don't have enough time to complete these chores they might not be done correctly or they may have to stay up late doing them. When students have to stay up late they might be tired, or not focused the next day at school. If students are not focused they wouldn't be able to complete their work or learn very efficiently. So as you can see, not having time to do chores could lead to many bad outcomes.  Money is something that many kids would like to have more of. Some kids have a job such as dog walking or babysitting. Some kids make money for their own benefit, some kids make money to help with their college tuition. Not all people are born into a wealthy family. Many families struggle financially and their child working after school and making money may make a difference and help out his or her family a lot. Either way, kids need time to do their job. If students have to take time out of there day to do a extracurricular activity, they might not have time to do their job. If a student has a job such as babysitting, they have to be available when the parent needs a babysitter. If a student isn't available when the parent needs them, he may seem like an irresponsible child, and may never get another chance to babysit and make money. So as you can see, kids need enough time to do their job regardless of why they are making money.  Having all the time after school to complete homework, chores, and maybe even making a little money, is something every student would like. Not being required to do an extracurricular activity benefits students in many ways. No student would have to stress about not having enough time to do anything. Students would also have a lot more free time to do what they enjoy, such as hanging out with friends or watching movies. Also, parents wouldn't have to stress about their kid failing classes or not getting their chores complete. These are all reasons the principals decision to require students to do an extracurricular activity is the wrong decision. Therefore, I do not agree with the principals decision to require students to do extracurricular activities because students may have homework they need to complete, chores to do at home, or they may have a job such as babysitting or dog walking.   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I believe that students should be allowed to participate in sports and other extra curricular activities with a grade lower than a "B" average. In some classes, a "B" is hard to earn. Many students earn a "C" in a lot of classes. According to our grading system, a "C" is average. Students should be allowed to participate in sports or other extra curricular activities with a "C" average, here are some reasons why.  As i stated before, according to our educators a "C" is an average grade, and anything above that, is above average. A lot of kids earn a letter "C" and if we didn't let them participate in extra curricular activities or sports, they might use their time for other things. If we don't let them participate, they might turn to drugs, alcohol, or other harmful substances. Most kids with lower grades are also more likely to be the kids who take drugs, drink alcohol, or use other harmful substances.  Furthermore, we don't want any child to feel left out. If a boy or girl isn't allowed to participate in sports or other activities, they might feel like they are different, or that no one wants them. Also, many students meet new people or friends on sports teams. A child may feel different from his friends if he cannot participate in after school activities. Another big issue, is the fact that the kids who are allowed to participate may bully, or make fun of the kids who aren't. Bullying is a big issue at our school and if we set standards to where you have to have a "B" average or above more bullying incidents will occur.  Lastly, school is the last chance many people may have to play sports, or join after school activities. We don't want to take away a child's chance to understand the pure joy of winning, the sadness of losing, and the rush you feel in the middle of the competition, when it is you against someone else. Sports or extra curricular activities is a good way for students to release anger, and maybe lose some of there competitive drive they might show toward others in the classroom. They will also show that sports is a good way to see how other communities work. If they travel to a school less fortunate then we are, they may feel that they need to volunteer, or donate. That would really help our community.  All in all, we shouldn't take away sports because a student has a grade point average lower than a "B." It would lead to students making bad decisions, or them getting bullied. Also, sports help kids vent their anger in a healthy, competitive manner. In sports or other activities, kids will meet new friends, or see communities that need help, and they may volunteer in our communities. In conclusion, a "C" is average and a student with lower than a "B," which is an above average grade, should be allowed to participate in sports.		0
Hundreds of students find it very difficult to get a job due to the lack of many skills and experiences as a result of being home schooled. Many students prefer distance learning rather than attending a public or private school. This is because they're afraid of being judged or mistreated by others. Although some may believe otherwise, Missing out on improving ones social skills and not being able interacting with others, prove that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home.  The first reason students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home is because they miss out on improving their socializing skills. I was personally home schooled when I was younger and found it difficult to socialize with other students when I started to attend a public school. This is significant because it shows how an individual can miss out on improving their social skills due to being home schooled. My cousin's have also experienced having difficulty socializing with others in collage due to distance learning. This is imperative because it also reveals how being home schooled can negatively impact someone when they go to collage.  Another reason students wouldn't benefit from getting an education at home is they will lack having experience interacting with others. Many people such as my friends don't know how to act in front of other students because they had been home schooled when they were younger. This is important because it shows how being home schooled at a young age and not interacting with many people can impact the way you act in front of others. My brother had also almost gotten suspended for making an inappropriate joke in class. This is significant because he was also home schooled and not having many interactions with other students and teachers almost caused him to get suspended.  Some may say that distance learning has nothing to do with improving ones social skills, they are mistaken. These individuals are wrong because when a student is being home schooled, they don't have the same experience socializing with others as someone who goes to a public school, therefor also not gaining as much skills as someone who isn't home schooled. Others might also say that getting educated at home has nothing to do with interacting with others, they are incorrect. These people are wrong because when students are home schooled, they don't get that many opportunities to interact with others and end up not knowing how to act around others.  When one considers all these points, it's clear that students wouldn't benefit from being able to take classes from home. Students who are educated at home lack lots of skills and experience. This problem can easily be solved if schools stopped offering distance learning. If schools keep offering distance learning, more and more students will find it hard to gain important skills and experiences.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬†		0
 The way we perceive and interact with others is largely influenced by our initial impressions of them. When we first meet someone, we are often hoping that they will be kind to us, and our perceptions of them are shaped by our own personalities and experiences. It is important to remember that first impressions are not always accurate, and that getting to know someone better can change our perceptions of them.  Our personalities can greatly impact how others perceive us. If we want to be seen as positive and likeable, we should strive to give good impressions by being friendly, engaging in conversation, and sharing positive experiences or accomplishments. It is also important to remember that our personalities are not fixed, and that we can change and grow over time.  When we are looking for a job or a romantic partner, our first impressions can play a significant role in how we are perceived. It is important to remember that our appearance, body language, and tone of voice can all contribute to our overall impression, and that we should strive to present ourselves in the best possible way.  It is also important to remember that first impressions are not always accurate, and that getting to know someone better can change our perceptions of them. It is important to be open to learning more about others and to be willing to see them in a different light. Ultimately, our interactions with others are shaped by our own personalities and experiences, and it is up to us to make the most of these interactions and to strive for positive and meaningful connections.		1
There is a lot contraversy regarding the Electoral College system of voting in the United States. Some voting members would argue that the system, although flawed, has yet to make a monumental mistake, and say that the minor issues were resolved or at the very least barely effective in the overall outcome of the capmaign. However, with the flaws and holes in the system we have alerady experienced, there is bound to be many more mistakes, and it would be shocking to very few that some of those mistakes are catastrophic. We should remove the system of the Electoral College because it is questionable, problematic, and does not represent well our democracy.  The Elecoral College uses a group of people from each state, numbers varying from each, to represent voters in an election. The voters mark down a candidate on a ballot. However, they are actually voting for a group of strangers to represent them. Many voters do not even realize that this is the case. In politics, there are many powerful and influential people who will go to drastic measures to ensure that their ideas somehow make it to power. Bribes and insentives could easily be given to electors in attempts to sway their vote. Speaking of, these electors can be anyone who are not in a public office position, emphasis on the anyone. Voters can never really be sure that they can trust those strangers who they did not even get to select. Once the votes have been counted, voters cannot fully control who the elctors actually vote for. There have been instances where electors have attempted to completely avert the votes cast and choose a different candidate that they want in office. It only seems logical that voters should have a direct say in the presidential election by participating in an election by popular vote. This way, there is less opportunity for scandal and confusion in the voting process.  In 1960, a group of segretationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in removing electors who supported John F. Kennedy with those who opposed him. If this had happened, all of the states electoral votes would have been cast by biased electors, rather than by the actual voters themselves. In the same year, Hawaii sent two state electors to congress instead of one. It is sad that we maintain a system in our government that continues to let issues like this arise. Along with issues with the electors, why is it that the size of a state automatically gives it a bigger advantage in elections? Texas and California are the most two saught-after swing states in every election. Candidates will do everything they can to win over those electoral votes. But what about the little states? Many of the smaller states do not get visited by candidates. Some never even see campaign ads. This system we are using creates target areas in the United States that are more valuable in elections than others. This is in no way fair to the voters in smaller states, despite having the exact same rights as voters of bigger states. The Electoral College is proving to be less and less glamorous with every passing election. Slip ups like this can create a monumentally bad situation, and unfortunately, this system is only bound to create more.  Many people remember the problem of the 2000 presidential election. The Electoral College had very effectively exemplified its flaws and unefficient ways of opperating. Al Gore and George Bush were running apposed, and despite winning the overall popular vote in the country, Gore lost the election to Bush. Bush had received the most electoral votes, therefore winning him the presidency. Basically, despite the fact that more citizens chose Gore to be president, Bush won out. In our constitution it is written that citizens of the United States have an unwavering right to vote and select who gets put into office. In this case, it sounds more like the number of electoral votes has an unwavering right to select who gets put into office. This goes against a democratic republic way of opperating our country and, in many ways, makes it more difficult for cititzens to take advantage of their rights.  For as many frustratingly resolvable problems that are created by the Electoral College, there are certain things about the Electoral College that could possibly make it worth keeping. For instance, there technically is no region of the country that has enough electoral votes to vote a president into office, so no one area of the controls large numbers of votes. Along with this, the system helps avoid Run-Off Elections (which complicate the election process and provide a clear winner). However, having a straightforward election where the votes come straight from citizens is most constitutional and much less problematic. The process has been used for a long time in our country, but it is time to make a change.  The Electoral College has proven to be more trouble than it's worth. Our country needs to decide what is within best interest for representation of our citizens, the most efficient way to opperate one of our most sacred constitutional rights, and maintain our democracy as members of our wonderful country. Remove the Electoral College system.       ¬†    		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME, no I do not think all students should be required to do community service because as teenagers, we should be able to choose for ourselves what we want to do with our free time.  some students may want to perform community service because that's what they like to do to help out the community, but other students feel that it is not needed and instead choose to go to the mall or to the movies.  One example of community service we have at our school is student council. participants in student council perform community service by recycling, raking leaves for people in our naborhood, or shoveling driveways and sidewalks for the elderly. But they don't always go around doing those favors; Some days they go on fun field trips to the movies or to amusement parks, and go ice skating because life isn't always about picking up trash or raking leaves. These tasks might be helpful to some but as young adults we also need freedom and fun in our daily schedules. I think that if you are going to require students to do community service, it should only be once or twice a week, and the days that groups of students go, should fit in their schedule because there might be something they have to do that is more important than community service. Also the students should be rewarded for their hard work, and participation.  I disagree with the requirement of community service because, if we like doing community service we will do it on our own time. Some parents might also disagree because they don't want their child missing school and missing out on a good education because they are out raking leaves and picking up litter. Yes, it does help the community and the residence in the community, and yes, it is helpful to people and is a good deed to do, but it is unfair to make someone do something that they don't want to do. that is		0
 The face on Mars, also known as the "Cydonia" region, is a fascinating feature that has been debated among scientists and conspiracy theorists for decades. The Cydonia region is a vast, flat area on the surface of the planet that appears to have been carved by some unknown force, leaving behind unusual features such as patterns, indentations, and what some believe to be the face of an ancient Martian civilization.  There are several theories surrounding the face on Mars. Some scientists believe that it is simply the result of natural geological processes, such as erosion and weathering. However, others argue that it is evidence of intelligent life on the planet, either now or in the past.  Despite the debate, the face on Mars remains a mysterious and fascinating feature of the Red Planet. It is a testament to the vast and complex history of the planet, and a reminder that there is still so much we don't know about the universe.  Overall, the face on Mars is an intriguing subject that requires further investigation and study. Whatever the true origin of the feature, it is certain to spark curiosity and debate for many years to come.  In conclusion, the face on Mars remains a mystery that continues to fascinate and intrigue scientists and conspiracy theorists alike. Whether it is the result of natural geological processes or evidence of intelligent life, the face on Mars is a testament to the ongoing exploration and discovery of our solar system. As our understanding of Mars grows, so too does our appreciation for the mysteries that it continues to hold.		1
The face in Mars is obviously just a natural landform. NASA, actuaslly have done their research on this topic while conspiracy theorists just base off the details. Now, since NASA is doing their reasearch they probably have a more than likely chance of being correct they've actually studied the object to see what it actually was. While these conspiracy theorist go with the common opinion about it floating around, and do no reasearch at all. The conspiracy theorists think that may NASA is hiding the fact that aliens have made this from the public because it may harm their budget. Taking this to 1976, camera resolution wasn't high enough to take good high quality photos yet because the technology was behind. The picture was blurry and it was one of those, "you've got to see it to believe it" moments because nothing could be made out from it. This is probably where that "aliens made this" conspiracy came from, the photo is so blurry looks as though some sort of alien space craft had landed here or the doing of aliens for artwork. Now, when you fast forward to 2001, you can obviously see more clarity in the picture. It almost looks as though this could be some alien artwork, but this is more than likely just a from a ship that has landed there and made this odd face like hole. Furthermore, if this was created by aliens it would be far more complex and wonderful than a face.  In closing, this "face on Mars" and the fact that it may have been created by aliens could be true. But reason rules this out, these faces are just a natural landform that were there from the beginning, human created, or were made from a landing ship.		0
Dear Principle  Most of the teenagers use there phones half of there life, Reconsidering the school's cell phone policy is a great idea, for many reason and some of the reasons are these. Even though you say not to bring cell phones to school students still do it , some of the students need to bring there phones to school to communicate with there parents telling them that they're at school. Other students need there phones incase of an emergency, and there parents need to contact there kids or the parents need to be contacted, the school can use there phones. It is a great idea letting the students use there phones during lunch or free periods that gives the students a feeling of trust from the school.  Not allowing students to use there phones at all is not really going to help. The students will find a way to bring there phones to school and use them while the teachers are not looking. Most of the students are already doing it, why you think putting a new policy is going to help the school it really is not, but by letting the students bring there phones in school and giving them time to use them is going to let the students know that the school trusts them, that the school doesn't think of them as children but as young and responsible adults.  To change the policy you have to look at the problem is booth ways in the mind of a teacher and in the mind of a student. Some of the teachers may think by bringing a phone to school is a sign of not having respect but it really isn't students don't mean to be rude. Sometimes there parents even ask them to bring there phones, other times the students want to bring there phones. The students in the other side feel as if the school doesn't trust them by not letting them bring there phones to school, they feel like children. All of this can be resolved if you let the students bring there phones to school and have them off and not use them, and letting them use them in there free time.  Sincerely  Your Student		0

 Mars, also known as the Red Planet, is one of the most interesting destinations for scientists and researchers to explore. With its vast, red terrain and cold, icy environments, there is still much to be learned about the planet. One of the most intriguing discoveries made on Mars is the face-like structure that has been observed on its surface.   This face-like structure, which has been nicknamed the "Face on Mars," is one of the most distinctive features found on the planet. It is a massive, triangular-shaped structure that spans several kilometers in size and is made up of a complex system of ridges, canyons, and valleys. The structure is so large that it can be seen from thousands of kilometers away with the naked eye, making it a difficult target to miss.  The Face on Mars is thought to have formed over billions of years through tectonic processes. Scientists believe that the structure may be the result of the planet's geological activity, which has caused the surface to move and change shape over time. This theory is supported by the fact that the structure is located on the planet's surface, where tectonic activity is most prevalent.  Despite its size and prominence, the Face on Mars remains a mystery. Scientists are still trying to figure out what caused the structure to form in the first place, and what it means for the planet's overall geology. Some scientists believe that the structure may have once been a large crater, which was then filled in with sediment over time to create the face-like shape we see today. Others believe that the structure may be the result of a massive volcanic eruption or an ancient ocean that once covered the planet.  The Face on Mars is still a fascinating discovery, and scientists are working hard to learn more about it. With further exploration and research, perhaps we will soon be able to solve some of the mysteries surrounding this intriguing feature of our neighboring planet.		1
PUT YOUR  CELL PHONE AWAY OR IM GONNA KEEP IT! That's what all teachers say to the students that have there cell phones out and they are right because what do we need with our cell phones in school all of our friends are around us we get to use on the weekends, after school pretty much all the time. When we are in school it is the teacher's time to teach us what we need to know so we can have a good job and not grow stupid and living on the side of the street. Cell phones are one of the main distractions to teens that's why they can't get their homework done, or forget to do their chores. They might not pay attention in class because their probably on FACEBOOK but that's a whole different story. I agree with the teachers one hundred percent because when your in school for seven in a half hours if I'm not mistaken that's it and that's all your teacher need's and some students cannot even do that. It's really getting out of hand because some students get caught and when the teacher asks for the phone then it's a huge issue and it's not the teachers fault because you should have never had your cell phone out in the first place.		0
Dear, TEACHER_NAME,  I have been informed that there is a school issue regarding whether students should be required to perform community service. Students should be required to perform community service. I think it would really say something about our school and SCHOOL_NAME would take a leader role in the community. The students should be out helping the community rather than sitting on the couch eating potato chips. In just one hour, there can be a lot of beneficial improvements towards the community. This service can also count towards kids National Junior Honor Society and service hours for Conformation or Bar/Bat Mitzvah's. Service hours can show a lot about someone's character and I think if all students were required to do this, everyone's character would build and get better. The community as a whole would become much better. Students can learn from helping out the community and might find a passion for a particular service. Others will realize that all these students are really trying to make a nicer community and then the other's will feel obligated to help out too. It takes a special person to really be dedicated to community service. The students will learn more about themselves and what they can do that will really help out society. If students start making positive attributes to the community you might see less crimes going around. This will also lead to students making better decisions and seeing themselves as a different person. Students will be honored by their community and should realize how much you put into to your community is how much your community will give back.  Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME		0
Dear Principle,  I have heard that you are considering a change in the schools cell phone policy. I think that this is a good idea. Kids will always use their phones in school, and there is no way that you will be able to catch them every time. Its just not possible! I personally think that you should go with Policy one, Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.  I think that this is the best thing to do because then kids can have time to get their texting in, kids can text and call in free time instead of doing other bad things, and kids wont be texting in class.  Kids will have time to text in other times of the day with this policy.  (Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.) Allowing children to text during lunch will get that "urge" out to communicate. Then, kids will not have that feeling during class. If they get the feeling during class, then they will text in class. This is because teachers are paying more attention to teaching then what the kids are doing (which is good and bad) but it is just what happens. If kids don't feel the urge to communicate then they wont have to text during school hours, or in class.  Another reason is because kids can text, or call during lunch and free time, instead of doing "criminal things" like graffiti. If kids are busy communicating then they will not have the time, or feeling to do bad things. If they are communicating maybe they will feel like someone will find out if they do those things. Over all, kids will be paying more attention to their phones to what things they can do to ruin the school community.  My last reason for choosing option one, is because kids will not text in class because they already did. Texting in class will go down a lot, and who cares if kids text in lunch? it's not disrupting anyone from anything, except eating. If kids choose not to eat then who cares, its their choice.  So this is why I think that option one is better. Kids can have time to get their texting in, kids can text and call in free time instead of doing other bad things, and kids wont be texting in class. So choose option number one, and allow children to text in lunch and other free time.  From,  The Student Body		0
Estimate Senator:  As one of the people living in Florida I am honor to have the opportunity to wirte you this letter telling you about what I think about keeping the Electoral College. For numerous reasons I think we have a better outcome of getting the candidate we want if we keep the Electoral College method to vote for our candidates.Does reasons are : certanity of outcoem, Everyone's president, and swing states.  Paragraph 1  Topic: Certainty of outcome  Support: Problems over Electoral College is possible but not as much as problems over popular vote. "The reason is that winning candidate's share of the winning candidate's share of the Electoral Colleg invariably exceeds his share of popular vote".This also benefits small states. In addition the is a possibility to have a tie in nationwide electoral vote " because the total number of votes-538-is an even number, but it is highly unlikely.."  Paragraph 2  Topic: Everyone's president  Support: The candidate have to be neutral, it cannot have favorite religion or section of the country because "The residents of the other regions ae likely to feel disenfranshised-to feel that their votes do not count,that the new president will have no regard for their interests,that he really isn't their president".  Paragraph 3  Topic: Swing States  Support: Candiates most of the time choose to focused more on the toss-up states because they are "the most thoughtful voters [and] should be the ones to decide the election".  Counterargument  "The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor".People are worried that the governmetn will choose for them. They do not realise that if we don't have the electoral college than that is is more than likely to happen because the electoral college is what allows us to have a voice, a say, in what we want in our future president.  Conclusion  Keeping the electoral colloge gives the peope the opportunity to choose wisely who they want taking care of them for the next four years.  Thank you for your time,  PROPER_NAME                   		0
Presidential elections provides the United States of America with an opprotunity of unification. The process of choosing the next leader of the United States always brings the people of the country together knowing that all of them play a role in the election. This is present in the popular vote, a vote consisting of the general population. However, the popular vote is not always accurate, as anyone of any background can vote as long as they hold proper citzenship. The electoral college on the other hand, is a process that serves as a compromise between Congress and the rest of America. The fact of the matter is, the electoral college is beneficial to the presidential election because it unifies Congress and the people of America, and is part of the country's roots.  To begin with, the electoral college, more than anything, unifies the people. The electors were once, as everyone in the nation is, an average citizen. According to Bradford Plumer the electors chosen, "...depend on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves." On top of that Bradford indentifies the electors as, "...anyone not holding a public office.". Bradford Plumer illustrates better than anyone that the electors chosen are average citizens who think the same as the rest of the general population while still keeping in mind that Congress must also be represented. Knowing this, the working-class people of America, and Congress can rest easy knowing that the electoral college process will make the decision that is best for the nation as a whole. This decision making, whether directly or indirectly, unifies the country. In 2012 more than three-fourths of the nation tuned in to watch the presidential election; in the end being one of the most watched televised elections in the country's history. This number includes Congressmen. This shows that the decision making process of the electoral college brings all the people of the nation together to decide on the choosing of the coutries next leader.  The general population, though average citizens, are somtimes not as qualified as Congress to make unbiased, beneficial decisions on behalf of the rest of the country. However, knowing that the next President could be a part of Congress, sometimes sways the decision in favor of a particular candidate. In this paradox of the qualification of Congress and the average citizen, the electoral college is used to fill the void. The electoral college has been used since the founding of the country. The founding fathers of America (George Washington, Ben Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, etc.)must have developed the electoral college process for some reason. According to the Office of the Federal Register, "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens." More than anything the electoral college is a mutual and nuetral process that represents something inbetween the biased politics of Congress and the average citizen. The average working class person is the greatest example of American integrity. This person shows that in this great nation, if you set a goal and are willing to work to acheive that goal, it can be acheived. Why strip this moral that has represented the United States of America since its first years?  While there have been a few flaws in the electoral college throughout history, this decision making process still unifies the people of America and is still, most importantly, part of its roots. More than anything, the electoral college process represents the two sides of the country: Congress and the average working class citizen. So, rest easy knowing that the next election, there is a process between Congress and average working citizens that works to make the decision that is best for the people of this great nation, the United States of America.       ¬†    		0
 The electoral college system established in the United States is designed to give each state equal representation in the selection of the president, based on its population, but this system has been the subject of controversy and debate for centuries. The question is whether the electoral college still serves its purpose and whether it works effectively in selecting the best candidate for the job of president.  The electoral college system works by awarding a set number of votes to each state based on its population. A majority of states is required to elect a candidate, and states that are allocated more electoral votes have more influence over the election outcome. The idea behind this system is to allow small states to have a significant voice in the selection of the president by giving them more representation than they would have under a purely population-based system.  However, critics argue that this system is outdated, and the current voting system is more representative of the population. They argue that states with smaller populations should not have the same amount of influence over the election outcome as states with larger populations. Additionally, critics argue that the electoral college system is prone to corrupt practices, such as vote suppression and redistricting, which undermines the principle of one person, one vote.  On the other hand, supporters of the electoral college argue that it is an effective system that ensures that the president is chosen based on a range of factors, not just population. They argue that the electoral college system encourages candidates to appeal to a broad range of voters, not just those in large cities or urban areas. Additionally, supporters argue that the electoral college system gives more emphasis to states with a history and tradition of voting, which helps to promote stability and continuity in government.  In conclusion, the electoral college system has its strengths and weaknesses, and the question is whether it still serves its purpose in selecting the best candidate for the job of president. While critics argue that the current system is outdated and prone to corrupt practices, supporters argue that it is an effective system that encourages candidates to appeal to a broad range of voters and promotes stability in government. Ultimately, the electoral college system must be subject to ongoing review and reform to ensure that it continues to serve the best interests of the American people.		1
Standardized testing is a hot topic in the education industry. It has been a subject of debate for many years. Some people believe that standardized tests are an accurate measure of student ability, while others think otherwise. In my opinion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability.  Firstly, standardized tests only measure a student's ability to memorize information. They do not measure a student's critical thinking skills, creativity, or problem-solving abilities. These skills are essential for success in the real world, and they cannot be measured by a multiple-choice test.  Secondly, standardized tests are biased. They are designed to favor students from certain backgrounds and cultures. For example, a student who speaks English as a second language may not perform as well on a standardized test as a student who speaks English as their first language. This is because the test is designed to measure a student's ability to understand the language, not their knowledge of the subject.  Lastly, standardized tests do not take into account a student's learning style. Some students learn better through hands-on activities, while others learn better through visual aids. Standardized tests only measure a student's ability to take a test, not their ability to learn.  In conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. They only measure a student's ability to memorize information, are biased, and do not take into account a student's learning style. Schools should focus on alternative methods of assessing student ability, such as project-based learning, portfolios, and performance assessments. These methods provide a more comprehensive view of a student's abilities and are a better indicator of their potential for success in the real world.		1
These days in the generation that we live in, man has came up with many ways to use technology. We have motion sensored lights, cameras, game systems, and now even cars. Former Google cofounder Sergey Brin and Google have made cars that can actually drive on they'r own. These cars can drive themselves more than half a million miles without crash, but they still need assistance from a driver once in a while when it comes to things they can't do such as reversing, dealing with accidents, or traffic issues. In my point of view this sounds really cool wont lie. Another thing is we all have to see the bigger picture.  Let me explain myself. In the good way of seeing it driverless cars would be a good affect on us for so many reasons. One is we wouldnt have to worry about reckless drivers when the cars would be programed to know speed limits and everything a human is suppose to know about driving. There would be less injuries, deaths, losses in money for repairs, and much more. We also wouldn't have to take driver tests and have licences so we could get to where we need to go. Thoes are the positive ways I look on the driverless cars idea.  Now lets look how this idea would effect us in a negative way. We all know somtimes technology can have errors such as glitches, viruses, if it is mistrested then it could damage all the way. See technology is very sensitive in my view and somtimes even dangerouse. Imagine yourself in one of these cars and say it starts to act up either your gonna be left stranded where you are or you could possibly be injured depending on what the car does. We all know technology can have a mind of its own. Also when a accident happens who ever is in the driver seat is responsible for the passangers and pedestrians and if something does happen are you gonna blame the car?  Like i said the idea is really cool I wont lie. Us as people thoe have to make the right desicions in what we choose to do. Weigh the facts and reasons and see your piont of view. Thank your for your time.   		0
 The Face on Mars  The face on Mars, also known as Ceres, is one of the most famous features on the Red Planet. It is a giant impact crater that is nearly 3,800 miles wide and has the appearance of a face, with a mouth and two horns on either side. Scientists suspect that Ceres is over 4 billion years old, older than Mars itself.  It was discovered in 1877 by American astronomer William Henry Pickering while he was surveying Mars using a telescope. Pickering named the crater in honor of the Roman goddess Ceres, who was goddess of agriculture and harvest.  Ceres is not only visually striking but also scientifically important. Because of its size and age, it is believed to be one of the oldest surviving impact craters in the solar system. The impact that created Ceres would have been almost unimaginably powerful. It is estimated that the energy released would have been equivalent to a million asteroid impacts.  Scientists also believe that Ceres was once covered in water. The evidence for this comes from recent discoveries of liquid water on the nearby dwarf planet Ceres. Scientists also believe that water may exist below the surface of Mars, in the form of an ocean or sea.  The face on Mars has also had an impact on human imagination and culture. It has been depicted in countless paintings, books, and movies. It has even been used as a symbol of Mars itself. The face on Mars has become a part of our cultural heritage and has helped to popularize science and technology.  In conclusion, the face on Mars, or Ceres, is a fascinating and important feature of our solar system. Its discovery and study have provided valuable insights into the past and given us a glimpse into the future. It is a reminder of the limitless possibilities that science and exploration offer.		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME  I think community service is a great idea, but unfortunately other students think its a waste of time and will refuse to do it. On the other hand, others would like to volunteer and do the right thing. There should be a catch to this, for example: anyone that does 10 hours a month will get a pizza party with a movie. These kinds of things will persuade a person to want to volunteer.  At the end of the year, everyone who did more than 50 hours will go to Six Flags for all the effort they put in.  Everyone should get fun things to do like at a daycare center, teaching little kids to read, playing with the children that are in the hospital. Its not only good for our students, but to other people we are helping. Anything is possible if everyone gets involved to the something. With the good out of all of this, there will be less troubled people in this school. The people who help with feeding the home less will have a chance to talk to them and learn why they are homeless. It will make them realize that they want to do good in school so that they don't end up homeless.  Helping out with children will give girls a lesson on how hard it is to a raise a child and that its not a fun and games. Going to the hospital to visit the sick children is a good way to interact with people their own age. Community service is not just good to do, bit its also good for everyone to know more about life and the real world.  Sincerely  STUDENT_NAME		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME  My name is STUDENT_NAME and i' m against you for trying to make it where student can't play sports with out a B average. The reason why is student work hard at school they still do they work but it hard maintain a B average for student even for the ones that do not play sports. I should know i run track for SCHOOL_NAME and i have an A, B, C average in SCHOOL_NAME and it is tough to keep that average. Yes you feel we can do better but not half the student in all the united states can not make a B average . The reason I can cause i put my study time in class or at break or sometime at PE and expository classes. Some student do not get the help i do but keep their average at a C witch is still difficult to do for me and other fellow student in the united states. Think back when you played sports in middle school and high school was it difficult for you or not. I feel you would get a lot more grade pull ups if slack down the grade positioning just to play sports. you said you can still past with a D average, but we can't play sports with a C average. It not right for student who work hard in subjects that they are really learning for the first time and their pasting higher than the ones who past with D averages. So please TEACHER_NAME do not make where student that play sports have to make a B average just to play sports.  Sincerely a  SCHOOL_NAME student		0
Venus is considered as Earth's twin, so why not explore it and have information about it, right? Allowing the people on Earth to be educated about space life is incredible and would probably do so much for us. The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" supports his idea very well by educating us of the idea that Venus may of had life on it at one time, explaining to us that we need to chase our imaginations and telling the idea that Venus is basically the sister of Earth!  Life on Venus. That may of been the case a long time ago according to many astronomers. The article states, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." If Venus once had the ability to support life, it might have that ability again! If we take the risks and time to explore Venus, we might not just have to choose what country or state to live in. We could possibly choose what planet!  Being a day dreamer or someone who thinks often could give you a whole new world. What if we literally had a whole new world though? According to the passage, "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." To imagine the population on Earth becoming smaller because of people going to live on Venus is amazing and wild.  Venus is the closest planet to Earth, referring to size and density. The author mentioned "Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." If that is the case, then we should explore it to make it the TWIN of Earth.  Life on Mars was very well thought of, but now Venus has come into the equation. The author of this passage makes his thoughts very clear that Venus is a risk that would be well taken by, implying life may have already been on Venus, Imagination can get the best of us and we should let it sometimes, and Venus is identical to Earth, so we should at least try.		0
**A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves**  I've always been a cowboy. I grew up on a ranch in Texas, and I spent my days riding horses, herding cattle, and fixing fences. But when I was 16 years old, I got the chance to do something that I never thought possible: I went on a seagoing cowboys program.  The Seagoing Cowboys program is a unique opportunity for young people to learn about the marine environment and the history of the American West. Participants live on a ship for six weeks, traveling to different ports along the coast of the United States. Along the way, they learn about marine biology, ecology, and maritime history. They also get to help out with tasks on the ship, such as sailing, fishing, and cooking.  I was so excited to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. I had never been on a ship before, and I was eager to learn more about the ocean. I was also looking forward to meeting new people from all over the country.  The first few weeks of the program were tough. The work was hard, and the seasickness was even worse. But I stuck with it, and I'm so glad I did. The program was an amazing experience, and I learned so much.  One of the things that I loved most about the program was the people. I met some of the most amazing people from all over the country. We came from different backgrounds, but we had one thing in common: we were all passionate about the ocean.  We spent our days learning about the ocean and exploring new places. We went on whale watching expeditions, visited sea turtle sanctuaries, and learned about the history of the maritime industry. We also had a lot of fun together. We played games, told stories, and sang songs.  The Seagoing Cowboys program was an unforgettable experience. I learned so much about the ocean, the history of the American West, and myself. I made lifelong friends, and I had the time of my life.  If you're looking for an amazing summer experience, I highly recommend the Seagoing Cowboys program. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn about the ocean, meet new people, and have a lot of fun.  **Conclusion**  The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to learn about the ocean and the history of the American West. It's also a great way to meet new people and have a lot of fun. If you're looking for an amazing summer experience, I highly recommend this program.		1
Dear Principal,    I am writing to you regarding the school's cell phone policy review and formally recommend adopting Policy 1 allowing supervised phone use during lunch and free periods. While there are certainly merits to limiting distraction in class, an outright ban seems unnecessary and counterproductive.   Phones have become so integrated into daily life that a total prohibition could foster resentment and encourage disobedience. Teenagers will find ways to access technology regardless, so having clear, reasonable rules establishes structure without feeling oppressive. Policy 1 still prevents disruption to lessons while respecting that phones are now an expected part of life outside school walls.   Supervised phone use during breaks could even benefit students' well-being. It allows for brief contact with friends and family that promotes mental health, like checking in with parents after school. An outright ban may cause unwarranted stress or isolation. Modern phones also enable recreation, like listening to music, that enriches free time in a healthy way.  Policy 1 is also more practical. It sets students up for responsible device management expected in college and jobs. An outright ban does not prepare them for navigating phone policies in future education and careers. Reasonable limits teach balance, whereas a draconian ban risks rebellion without learning self-discipline.  In conclusion, adopting Policy 1 strikes the right balance of respecting students' modern lives while also enabling focus during class. It establishes structure without resentment, fosters responsibility rather than reaction, and benefits mental wellness. I strongly recommend this permissive yet supervised approach as the soundest cell phone policy for our school.  Please let me know if any part of my rationale requires further explanation. I hope this input is helpful as you finalize your decision.  Thank you for your consideration.		1
It's a week before your junior year starts. You're laying in bed, soaking up your last few days of freedom. Then it hits you- you have a book report due the first day of school. Panic sets in, chaos erupts. Oh, the joy of summer projects. Most students have been through the process of completing a summer project. In most circumstances, these projects are a strict set of directions created by the teacher. Summer projects are expected, especially when taking difficult classes. Students, due to different commitments, should be able to design their own summer projects.  Teenagers today are exposed to a lot more than when our parents were our age. Some of those things aren't beneficial, such as too much screen time or drinking underage. But, a lot of this exposure is good. We're exposed to different cultures at an early age, we have easier access to education, and we know when disaster strikes, it's our responsibility to help. Because of all this new exposure, students often make commitments over the summer. Students accepted into college summer programs go to learn more about something their interested in. Some make the world a better place by doing service with a church group or other organizations. College is expensive, so a large quantity of teenagers get a summer job to save up money. There's always going to be the group of teenagers who sit at home all summer watching TV and eating junk food. With this wide variety of responsibilities and commitments, having every student complete the same exact summer project is unreasonable.  At most schools, you don't meet your teacher until a week prior to school starting. Knowing nothing about the class is a scary thought if you're spending hours a day working on a summer project, assigned by a teacher you've never met. If students know nothing about a teacher and the class they lead, how are they supposed to know if they're going to stay in the class? It's ridiculous to ask for a teenager to commit to an intensive project when they might only be in the class for a day. Most schools that allow schedule changes will forget about that grade if you drop the class early on into the school year. It may be nice that you don't have to be in that class anymore, but hours upon hours of your life were wasted on a project you'll never get a grade for. If students were able to design their own summer project, it would not only give them creative freedom but allow them to feel proud of what they turn in, regardless if they stay in the class. No student enjoys writing an essay every time they do a project, so if the projects were created by students the final results could be even more outstanding than what any teacher could've designed.  If students are designing their own summer projects, it not only shows their personality and character- it raises their expectations for the class in the best way possible. Most teachers want their students to be excited for their class. Even if the class course is torturous, a teacher who loves their job can make all the difference in the world. If a teacher gives their students the freedom of creating their own summer project, the students will have a good image of the teacher. Students that enjoy a class tend to be the ones who do the best. Most teenagers don't enjoy being tied down by rules, so getting them excited for a class that has rules is the ideal situation.  Summer projects aren't a bad thing. They not only keep a student's brain activated during the summer, but they give them a taste of a class before they commit fully. Because of all the opportunities we have as teenagers in today's age, our schedules can get pretty busy. Although, I do still think an education is important. Summer projects allow students to ease themselves back into the routine of the school year before it hits them like a train. If those projects are student designed, it allows us to learn about time and self management. They also allow us to express our creativity. I'm not saying someone who draws a stick figure should get the same credit as someone who writes a five page essay. In my ideal situation, the teacher can give their students a vague set of directions so the students are free to express themselves.¬†		0
Regular inactive times are crucial for maintaining good health and well-being. In today's fast-paced world, it is easy to become overwhelmed by work, school, and other responsibilities, leading to a lack of time for rest and relaxation. However, research has shown that regular inactive times can have numerous benefits, including a longer life, fresh ideas, and more energy.  One real-life example of the danger of not having regular inactive times is the case of a person who works long hours without taking any breaks. This person may experience physical and mental exhaustion, leading to a decline in productivity and overall health. In fact, studies have shown that individuals who work long hours without taking breaks are at a higher risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.  On the other hand, having regular inactive times can have numerous benefits. For example, taking regular breaks can help individuals recharge their batteries and improve their focus and productivity. Additionally, regular inactive times can help individuals develop fresh ideas and creative solutions to problems. Research has also shown that individuals who take regular breaks are at a lower risk of developing chronic diseases and have a longer lifespan.  Personally, I have experienced the benefits of regular inactive times. When I take regular breaks throughout the day, I feel more energized and focused, and I am able to accomplish more in less time. Additionally, taking regular breaks has helped me develop new ideas and solutions to problems I was facing at work.  Regular inactive times can also help individuals achieve their goals. For example, taking regular breaks can help individuals reduce stress and improve their overall well-being, leading to a better quality of life. Additionally, regular inactive times can help individuals develop healthy habits such as exercise and healthy eating, leading to a healthier body and mind.  In conclusion, regular inactive times are crucial for maintaining good health and well-being. Research has shown that regular inactive times can have numerous benefits, including a longer life, fresh ideas, and more energy. Additionally, personal experiences and studies have shown that regular inactive times can help individuals achieve their goals. Therefore, it is important to prioritize regular inactive times in our daily lives.		1
Do Google cars truly work? Can humans completely trust a machine to do all of the work for them with their lives on the line? Although Google cars are really interesting and intelligent, these cars cannot be trusted. These cars can only help a person drive and alert them when the task is too hard for the car. All drivers must remain alert throughout the ride, and not everyone can stay alert. Also, what happens if the car ends up in an accident? Someone will have to pay for the price, which can cause immense conflict. Therefore, Google cars should not be produced and sold to customers, for it will cause conflict and danger for everyone.  In paragraph seven, the author states that "none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless." This statement means that the cars cannot drive completely by themselves and will need a person to be alert in case the road "requires human skills." Although the seat vibrates to get the driver's attention, it is possible that some will not be able to react quick enough, which may cause a severe car accident.  Because of this problem, people must stay alert just in case they go though a road that requires human skills. The author states that "the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over." This may seem like a simple issue, but it isn't; people who drive for a long period of time will get bored if they drive the Google car. In paragraph eight, the author questions this by asking, "wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?" If people get bored of waiting for their turn, then they will do something to get rid of their boredom, hence leading to a terrible accident.  When someone runs into a car accident, most people would blame the driver. In paragraph eight of the excerpt, it says, "If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault---the driver of the manufacturer?" Logically, both of them are at fault; the driver should have been paying attention, and the manufacturer should have known the consequences of selling the car. However, this will most likely unsatisfy the people. Everyone will get into a huge argument which will lead to an enormous conflict.  Google cars are an amazing invention, but it has some flaws; even if "Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time," people should not trust the car. What about the other 10 percent? The 10 percent shows that it is possible that the car will get into accident, and that accident could lead to thousands of people dead. These accidents will most likely happen because people were not alert during the times they should have been. Can one trust these cars to take them anywhere with their lives on the line, or should they risk the 10 percent and hope for the best?    		0
Many school, including the one I attend, have numerous extracurricular activities. These activities¬†range from sports to chess club. There is a diverse amount of things you could do as an extracurricular that could cater to everyone. Enforcing a rule that students must participate in at least one extracurricular may seem hostile and violating to students, but if we focus on it precisely, it actually has a few positives to it. This doesn't mean that there are downsides to this decision but exceptions could always be made if needed. I agree with the decision to make participation in at least one extracurricular mandatory because it is important to branch out and be apart of something, it gives students more to learn and more to do for themselves, but it does come at the price that some students are not able to do extracurricular activities for certain reasons.  Being social is something important that we should all be able to do. It helps us throughout our teenage and adult life. We can help improve our social skills by joining a club or a team because then we have to learn how to interact and connect with new people. It's good to branch out and meet new people because you may meet someone new who could end up being your best friend. Being apart of a team or a club could also teach you teamwork and collaboration skills that are important to have when you become an adult. Starting early on these skills by doing an extracurricular will end up helping you in the long run.  Being in a club or on a team will inevitably teach you something whether it's big or small. Learning new skills or lessons through activities offered at school is a positive thing because they could always be applied to real world situations. When students are given new information, they are able to do more with and for themselves, which then builds character. It also creates more opportunities to do things with their lives. Students are involved in new hobbies which adds more to how their daily lives are and how interesting they are in general.  Of course, like any plan for schools or elsewhere, it isn't perfect. There's many things someone could say as to why they disagree with the principal's choice, but, it benefits the majority of people. Now this doesn't mean that there are no good counterclaims to this decision because there are. A good amount of students don't do any extracurricular activities because they just don't have the time or means to participate. A student may not have the money to buy all the personal equipment they need for a sport, or the transportation to and from the activity, or they simply have too much on their plate, like babysitting a younger sibling. A good solution to these issues is to have it discussed with a guidance counselor to find a way to fix these problems. They could find a way for the school to help pay for them to participate in a sport or they could help find someone to carpool with. if no solution can be find though, then the student should be allowed to exempt from participation if there is no other solution.  In conclusion, the decision the principal has made is one that could help every student benefit from. It can add a lot more to a student's life and change it for the better. There is a large enough variety of extracurricular activities that the majority of students will be interested in at least one. This new rule is intended to help students in the long run as this will make it easier to develop new and exciting skills for themselves to use. It helps them develop social skills and be apart of something big and they learn new things for themselves. However, they do come with negatives as I had talked about, but there are solutions to them. In all, mandatory extracurricular participation is a rule I'm on board with.¬†¬†   ¬† ¬†¬†   ¬† ¬†¬†		0
The so-called "Face on Mars" is simply a natural landform, not evidence of alien visitation. While the vague facial features captured in early NASA photos sparked intriguing speculation, further study has clearly shown the formation to be a product of geology, not intelligence.   Some key pieces of evidence support this. First, when viewed at higher resolution by later NASA missions, the hills and shadows that gave the impression of eyes, nose and mouth from a distance were revealed to be merely random cracks and slopes conforming to the surrounding terrain. Their accidental resemblance to facial features was clearly an optical illusion rather than intentional design.   Second, the composition of the region, primarily made of rocks like sandstone and basalt that are known to erode into odd polygonal plateaus and mesas, provides a perfectly reasonable geological explanation for the landform's shape. Places on Earth with similar rocks, like the American Southwest, exhibit myriad landscapes sculpted by natural forces into uncanny and vaguely symbolic appearances. The idea that planetary processes could not account for this one Martian feature requires a leap of faith absent geological proof.  Finally, no other artifacts or evidence of civilization have ever been found near the "Face." If it were truly an artificial construct, we would expect to find other signs of an advanced culture nearby, such as infrastructure, tools or waste. But high-resolution images show only more typical Martian panoramas of rocks and sand. The isolated nature of this single formation argues against its being anything other than a quirky confluence of natural hills.   In conclusion, while the human tendency to seek patterns can make formations like the "Face on Mars" suggestive of design to some, scientific scrutiny reveals it to be simply another curious rock outcropping across the red plains, no different from countless others gradually shaped depuis time by the passive action of wind and weather on Martian terrain. Future observations of the Red Planet will surely uncover many more strange landforms, but none require alien visitation to reasonably explain their origin. The "Face" remains, as the article concludes, a reminder of how easily our minds can perceive the paranormal where only natural geography exists.		1
Having a positive attitude is crucial to achieving success in life. A positive mindset allows individuals to approach challenges with optimism and resilience, leading to greater outcomes. On the other hand, a negative mindset can lead to a lack of motivation, self-doubt, and ultimately, failure.  Firstly, having a positive attitude allows individuals to focus on the possibilities and opportunities that lie ahead. When faced with challenges or obstacles, a positive mindset enables individuals to view them as opportunities for growth and learning. This approach leads to a greater willingness to take risks and embrace new experiences, ultimately leading to greater success.  On the other hand, a negative mindset can lead to a lack of motivation and self-doubt. Individuals with a negative mindset may view challenges as insurmountable and may give up before even attempting to overcome them. This mindset can lead to a lack of progress and ultimately, failure.  Furthermore, a negative mindset can have significant consequences in both personal and professional settings. In personal relationships, a negative mindset can lead to a lack of trust, communication, and ultimately, a breakdown in relationships. In professional settings, a negative mindset can lead to a lack of productivity, creativity, and ultimately, job loss.  On the other hand, maintaining a positive attitude can lead to numerous benefits. A positive mindset can lead to increased motivation, self-confidence, and a greater sense of purpose. This approach can lead to greater success in both personal and professional settings. Additionally, a positive mindset can lead to better mental and physical health, leading to a greater quality of life.  In conclusion, having a positive attitude is essential to achieving success in life. A positive mindset allows individuals to approach challenges with optimism and resilience, leading to greater outcomes. On the other hand, a negative mindset can lead to a lack of motivation, self-doubt, and ultimately, failure. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a positive attitude in order to achieve success in life.		1
I think the minimum wage should be raised in our country because it will help many people who are struggling to make ends meet.  Firstly, raising the minimum wage will help reduce poverty. Many people who earn minimum wage are living in poverty and can't afford basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. By raising the minimum wage, these people will have more money to spend on these necessities and will be able to live a better life.  Secondly, raising the minimum wage will help boost the economy. When people have more money to spend, they are more likely to spend it on goods and services, which will help businesses grow and create more jobs. This will also help reduce unemployment and stimulate economic growth.  Lastly, raising the minimum wage will help reduce income inequality. The gap between the rich and poor in our country is growing, and raising the minimum wage will help bridge this gap. It will also help ensure that everyone has a fair chance to succeed and live a decent life.  In conclusion, raising the minimum wage in our country will have many benefits, including reducing poverty, boosting the economy, and reducing income inequality. It's time for our government to take action and raise the minimum wage to help those who need it the most.		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I think this change in policy is unneeded for many reasons and I hope that this letter will help you come to my understanding. Many students at this school participate in sports and some of them are not very good at school work but they at least have a passing grade. Some students have a lot on their hands not only at school, but at home as well. If you make this policy official then it will put more stress on students to keep up with their grades more than ever, and if they have more stress on them they will perform poorly at tournaments and meets. Some may not be able to even compete because they are at home trying to do work to keep a b average.  I can see why you would want to keep students grades up and keep the student body as smart and hard working as possible, but some students can't handle that kind of pressure added on to what they've already got going on. So in conclusion you should just keep the policy that you and so many other schools have kept for years and years to come. In this way maybe we can have a few more students winning medals and district championships than in the schools past years.		0
Some schools allow students to take their classes from the comforts of their home, but is that a beneficial way for them to learn? A student can learn from many ways, but learning from their house they are more prone to distractions, skip classes easier, and not have the full experience of having to be at a workplace working with other people.  This option of learning can be beneficial to some students. Kids who work or have to take care of a younger sibling, may find this method to be easier for them to find time for their school work or their work outside of school. In some cases, a kid could be expected to be the grown up at home and be the one responsible of taking care of their family. Learning online could help them a lot, since they would be at home watching over things and be able to find more time for their job.  Taking classes at home can lead a student to be distracted more easily. The fact that at home, a student has all of their electronics and accessories available to them, makes this idea more likely to happen. A student could be on their phone or even be watching TV the whole time they are taking this online class. Distractions can occur more frequently if a student takes online classes.  A student taking an online course can skip class much more easily. If you have ever tried to skip class in school, you would know that the school's staff would most likely prevent that from happening. So, who would prevent that from happening if a student took online classes? Knowing how most parents go to work during school hours, a kid could easily miss their online class and makeup an excuse later. Skipping class could be easier for a student taking online classes.  If a student took online courses, they would not get the full experience of working with others in a workplace. Working with others is something important that a student should learn in school. Many jobs out there require you to work with other people to get something done. Going to school can help you get comfortable with communicating and working with other people. It is an ability you would not really get from sitting behind a computer at home. Working with others is something you will most likely learn by attending school.  The option of taking classes at home is not beneficial to students. At home a student can experience more distractions, be able to skip class more easily, and not really learn how to work with others in a workplace. The choice of taking your classes at school would benefit a student more.¬†¬†		0
The debate over the legalization of marijuana has been ongoing for several years, with strong opinions on both sides. Some argue that the drug should be legalized, while others believe that it should remain illegal. In my opinion, the legalization of marijuana would have more negative consequences than positive ones.  One reason I am against the legalization of marijuana is the potential health risks associated with it. Marijuana use has been linked to a variety of mental and physical health problems, including addiction, impaired memory and concentration, and increased risk of heart disease. These potential health risks could lead to an increase in healthcare costs, which would ultimately burden taxpayers.  In addition, legalizing marijuana could lead to an increase in crime. While some argue that legalization would decrease crime associated with the illegal drug trade, it could also lead to an increase in other criminal activity. For example, driving under the influence of marijuana could lead to an increase in traffic accidents and related crimes.  Furthermore, the legalization of marijuana could have a negative impact on youth. Making the drug easily accessible could encourage younger people to try it, which could lead to a lifetime of addiction and other problems. Additionally, marijuana use could impair their judgement and decision-making abilities, affecting their education and future opportunities.  Finally, there are potential economic drawbacks to the legalization of marijuana. While some argue that legalization could create jobs and generate revenue, it could also have negative consequences. For instance, legalization could lead to a decrease in productivity, as more people may use the drug recreationally and miss work or have reduced productivity.  In conclusion, the potential health risks, increased crime rates, negative impact on youth, and economic drawbacks all suggest that the legalization of marijuana would ultimately have more negative consequences than positive ones. Therefore, I strongly believe that the drug should remain illegal.		1
Schools are full of kids getting their education. Not all of these kids actually care about learning though. Many are only there because they have to be. A new technology called Facial Action Coding System could help lessen the negative attitudes of these types of students. We have the technology to find out how a student feels about the lessons they're receiving. We can figure out what types of lessons interest students the most. This wouldn't fix everything or be the best method for every student but it would definitely be valuable to have this kind of technology.  Every teacher has their own method of teaching and every student learns differently from one another. This shouldn't be changed. However, we can make the students more engaged and interested in their education. This won't work for every student, but it can help with many. Facial Action Coding System is a new software that reads the muscles of the human face to figure out what a person is feeling. This could detect what interests, bores, upsets, and delights students. This would allow the computer to help the teacher to plan lessons that have the most positive effect on the students. The software reads the muscles on the face and uses that to detects what they like or don't like. The software could then alter the lesson plan to make it so that it is in a way that the students would most benefit from. Not every single student will have the same opinion as another or take out the same amount of information from a lesson as another, but this could definitely help teachers to see what works for certain students.  Facial Action Coding System could be a very valuable technology for educating the youth. We have the technology to figure out what does and doesn't work when trying to teach students. Some students wouldn't benefit from the same things as others but this could still be very valuable to the teacher to see what students benefit from a certain type of lesson. This could help many dissengaged students to find interest in their education instead of dozing off in class. 		0
Home schooling would not be benefitial for students and society as a whole. This form of education would harm the student in the long run due to lack of social engagement with other students and people in general. Getting an education provided at home and not at the school may also slow down the process of becoming an independent person in society. Decision making would be much more difficult due to lack of real world experiences.  The damage towards the students social engagement in the long run would be severe. Humans are a unique type of species that like to socialize with other human beings, its just the way we were made. Humans would also need to build and improve there social skills and build character overtime. The one place where you develop social skills and build your character as a whole would be public schools, and allowing students to become home schooled would change the outcome of who that student is as a person in a negative way; That would just be a disservice to not only the student, but society overall.  The process of becoming more of an independent person as a student would be much slower if you were home schooled most you life. When homeschooled, you have everything at reach including your parental figures, which would mean that you would be more reliant towards your parental figures and aswell you would not need to leave your home. The transition between being a teenager to becoming an adult would be much harder due to the lack of social skills and character provided from being home schooled.  Decision making would be much more difficult and ineffective for someone who is home schooled compared to someone who has gone to public school most of there life. People make decisions and choices based off the real world experiences they have had in there life. Being home schooled would mean you would have a lack of experience in society compared to someone who has gone to public school most there life. Having real world experience is very benefitial and will help out anyone in the longrun, therefore home schooling would not be appropriate for students.  Due to its negative effects towards the student as a person overtime, homeschooling would not be benefitial towards students or society as a whole; Therefore education should not be provided at home, and should be provided in a safe area with a social friendly enviorment.   ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†		0
 Dear State Senator,  I am writing to express my viewpoint on the topic of whether the Electoral College works. There have been ongoing debates about whether the electoral college system should be abolished in favor of a popular vote for the president of the United States. While I understand the main arguments for changing the system, I strongly believe that the Electoral College is an important part of our nation's history and serves as a fair and effective way to elect our president.  One of the main arguments for abolishing the Electoral College is that it can lead to a candidate ignoring certain states or demographics in favor of others. For example, in the 2008 election, then-candidate Barack Obama only won four swing states, which led to his eventual victory. Critics argue that this kind of behavior is not in the best interest of the country as a whole and could lead to a candidate being elected without winning the popular vote.  However, I believe that the Electoral College actually encourages candidates to engage with all voters, not just those in swing states. In order to win, a candidate must not only win highly populated urban areas, but also rural and suburban areas. This means that candidates must pay attention to all parts of the country, not just a select few. Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that smaller states are not completely overshadowed by larger ones, as their votes have just as much weight in the election as anyone else's.  Another argument against the Electoral College is that it can lead to a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election. This happened in the 2000 and 2016 elections, when Al Gore and Donald Trump respectively won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote. Critics argue that this is not fair and that the Electoral College does not accurately represent the will of the people.  However, I believe that the Electoral College serves as a check and balance for the popular will. While it is true that candidates must win the popular vote in order to win the election, they must also win the electoral vote, which means they must appeal to a diverse range of voters. This ensures that the president is not only elected by a narrow group of people, but by a representative sample of the country as a whole.  In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Electoral College works and serves as an important part of our nation's history. While there may be issues with the system and ways in which it could be improved, I believe that the Electoral College provides a fair and effective way to elect our president. Thank you for your time and consideration.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
The use of technology to determine the emotional expression of students in a classroom is not valuable. I personally do not think that a computer can analyze a human face and determine in percentages what their emotions are. A human can not be 2% angry and 75% happy. A computer can only determine what looks like on the outside, but not in the inside.  We humans can guess by looking at someone if they are upset, furious, meloncholoy, or estatic. Humans can determine that by their body character or their facial expressions. We cry when we are angry, sad, or happy. A computer could not know that. We ask how they're feeling and most of the time humans can lie about their emotions. They tend to hide them within a smile or a laugh. People may look angry, but that's their natural face expressions. In a room full of students, you are going to get many different emotions depending on what time it is during the day. If it's the morning, students will most likely be tired or sleepy. If it's around noon they may be hungry. During the afternoon students will most likely to be ready to leave school. The time of day can have a mega impact on a person's mood.  A computer may have an estimated guess on a person's mood, but it will never determine it. Us humans are special. We have many different ways we express emotion. We may feel many emotions at the same time, but a computer system could not determine that. We change how we feel all the time. We may not express it either. The FACS system may mistake our emotions through one picture. They could see a picture of you crying and decided that your sad, but in reality you're crying of laughter. In my opinion, you can not decide the expression of Mona Lisa just by looking at one painting. If they had a document saying she was happy most of the time her portrait was painted, then would believe it. Since they don't, I don't believe in anything FACS has documented.  The use of technology can not determine ones emotion(s). Only we can decide on what we feel or how others feel. I strongly believe that we are the only ones who can see emotion. 		0
Electoral Voters  Citizens of the U.S. have been voting for their presidents ever since George Washington was elected. They vote because they want their voices and opinions to be heard. So they can provide ways to make their lives better. But the truth of the matter is, we don't make the decisions. The Electoral College does. They should change the election to go by popular vote of the United States. Reason being is because what's the point of voting if they won't listen and they only hand pick a few people out of the millions of others. But keeping the College would make it easier to have votes counted.  Initially, the point of voting is to be heard and to have things your way for once, but if it's falling on deaf ears, then why bother? For example, in 'The Indefensible Electoral College' writer Bradford Plumer states that, "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president." Okay lets say someone wanted to vote for the Republican, and they vote for one of the electors who pledge themselves to the Republican. We can't rely on a person's word. What if they change their mind and vote for the other? How can natural citizens know to put their faith into a random stanger. Clearly, the voter does not get a say in the matter.  Furthermore, the millions of people who vote are reduced to a small amout of people. "The Electoral College consists of five hundred thirty eight electors," and "Two hundred seventy is needed to decide who's president." - The Office of the Federal Register. So states like New York and Nebraska only have three to six people voting since they are small. While on the other hand, California, Texas, and Florida have about thirty to sixty. And with the civilians living there, it's still not enough. Honestly, it wouldn't even matter if they voted.  On the other hand, the smaller amount of people, the quicker the U.S can get a president. In paragraph 4 of 'In defense of the electoral college' it's replied that, "A tie is possible... but it is highly unlikely." The presidential vote in 2012 may have not been a landslide ,but at least it wasn't a tie. The small amount made it a lot easier to count the votes. And the majority of voters still got who they wanted ,so it wasn't all terrible. The electoral college hasn't all been bad.  The Electoral College has more cons than it has pros. A citizen's voice must be heard and that won't happen if only few people are heard. But votes can be counted faster if there's only a tiny amount.    		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I believe that the policy of having at least a B average to participate in school sports or activities is the correct thing to do. I believe this because, students who don't have at least a B average, or better, won't be able to handle having a good grades in school. They'll either be to busy to not do homework or to lazing to do school work. Or the student will be too sleepy in class. Also the student might not be focusing in school as much as they used to.  My first reason for this policy to be passed is that, if the below B average student goes to his or hers sport practices or meetings they would probably neglect their homework and school work. Which would cause the student to get an even lower grade average! Unlike with an A or B student who would always at least try to complete their school work and homework.  Another good reason to pass this policy of yours would be that, the student wouldn't have enough sleeping time, which again would make them struggle in school even more. If the below B average student was actually worried about their below average gradethey would		0
The usage of summer projects is an undermined technique that schools implement to educate their students. It incorporates an application process to subjects and topics learned in class, to real-world settings. For many students, this process of application is enough to instill certain topics into one's memory. Thus, to ensure that students receive a meaningful and valuable summer project, teachers should have the ability to design and construct these assignments. The reason for this is that teachers effectively utilize summer projects to introduce new topics, have a better understanding of the curriculum and subject, and can emphasize certain topics that are vital for students to understand.  Many students might find the first quarter of a new school year a bit cumbersome; however, with the aid of a teacher-designed summer project, students can establish a better academic foundation before entering¬†the school year. This process of learning a topic before it is discussed or taught in school has may psychological and academic benefits. In the book  Talent , the author describes the educational process as a learning curve; for our purposes, only the first and second stages in this process are critical to understanding the effects of teacher-designed projects. The first stage of this curve is the data gathering process, where a person begins¬†to input and understand the information into one's conscious thinking: this is typically the longest and most difficult phase in the learning curve. The second stage of this curve is the application process, where people now have the ability to translate their newly acquired knowledge to a real scenario. A majority of students might not know this, but the first step in this learning curve is what students experience in a classroom, which is why students might not fully grasp a topic the first time it is taught. Connecting back to the prompt, the teacher-designed projects act as a catalyst to this learning process, where students aren't starting at the bottom of the data gathering curve, rather, they have already progressed through the first stage of learning. With a general foundation, students have a better ability to digest the information given during class. Moreover, this state of being a faster learner has many psychological benefits; the most important one being a confidence and morale boost. Essentially, feeling that you have this supernatural ability to easily absorb information boosts your confidence in the class, which, in return, increases your productivity in that class. A teacher-constructed summer project ensures that students can begin this learning strategy by introducing new topics that will be discussed during the following year.  An important notion that should be addressed is that most students do not have a developed understanding of a subject's curriculum. However, teachers are trained and knowledgeable about the course curriculum, and have the ability to tailor the summer projects to the academic standards the students are expected to uphold. The issue with having a student-designed summer project is that the students might not have the ability to distinguish between topics that are less or more important. On the contrary, teachers posses the ability to guide their students to topics that are beneficial for them to understand. In other words, by allowing teachers to design the summer projects, students gain a better understanding to where the teacher is directing them throughout the new academic year.  Despite the evidence listed, some students are still not satisfied with having a teacher-designed project during the summer. The major claims they use to corroborate their defense is that the projects designed by teachers are not interesting enough or they do not necessarily appeal to the students' interest. First, it should be noted that these are very sensible and valid reasons to why someone might not want a teacher-designed summer project. In fact, when people to do not enjoy a certain task, they loose motivation to complete it. However, it should also be noted that teachers consider this claim when designing their projects. Personally, I have always received flexible summer assignments from my teachers, where they have allowed students to add information and topics they find interesting to the overarching theme of the project. Teacher-designed summer projects have the ability to make space for topics that students might find interesting, while also directing them towards important topics and ideas that will be addressed in the following year.  Like any logical argument, the good and harm of both teacher-designed and student-designed projects should be juxtaposed. For teacher-designed projects, there benefits include a smooth transition¬†into new topics, outlining important topics and ideas, and a tailored focus to the curriculum. The only major disadvantage to teacher-designed summer projects are that it might not be interesting for the student, which is not always the case. On the contrary, student-designed projects have the benefit of being interesting to the desires of the students themselves. However, student-designed summer projects have many disadvantages including a less reliable topic focus and a meandering project objective. Furthermore, it is evident that teacher-designed summer projects are more beneficial to the students than student-designed summer projects are.¬†		0
The school system may not be the brightest, but it upholds many realistic standards for students. Psychological and social demands of school are challenged by every individual's effort they put in. Being present in school has many unseen pleasures to our daily lives that will enforce a better future for students. Therefore, Students would benefit more being in school then working at home.  Every student has their demands and effect on its social life. With the wide spectrum of students use on their social life, it's certain that everyone has their need for it. Last year on summer break, everyday was passing by in an instant. Before i could even really grasp of how i could make each day more useful, school was going to begin in a week. I had not spent a single day with my friends and i could barely be happy anymore. Being extremely uncomftorable interacting with anyone after summer ended, i was not well adapted into a healthy social life anymore. Being around friends and friendly classmates is a mandaotry essence of being a human being. Developing the skills to meet new people and friends/classmates is a reason why school is more benefitial then working at home.  Having an online video that teaches you the information needed to know makes it difficult for students to get the right help they need and transition it to understanding the subject better. Having a teacher will give you real time feedback and possible work arounds to personal problems on the topic. On May 11, 2019, we had our SOL for my Geometry class. I had been sick the whole week before, meaning i was fully relying on the online information that was present and available to me for the possible instance of students being absent. Not only was the notes harder to memorize, but there werent any acrynoms or tips that teachers would sneak into their lessons. Searching up the questions had only showed me methods other use that were too complicated. Direct communication to the teachers will always be more benefitial then relying on the internet or given videos.  Having ease of access to learning the work and working at your own pace may present itself to be a better option then going to school, yet it ironically hinders their efforts and understandings. School schedules will have a set plan of each day, and each class will have teachers that plan the way the subject is being tought. Having a plan to follow will prevent students to get a set work done by a certain time. Procrastination is almost inevitable when relying on video conferencing or work at home. I cant help but play video games on my phone while doing work as i have the instant ease to do so. Spending so much time on media that i squeeze my work to late at night or early in the morning. Not only that, but a lot of the times, being too comftorable will make your life harder in the future.  Even if students dont seem to enjoy school, it is very important and essential for proper development into the future of everyone. Nothing can be perfect, and that goes with school system as well. Yet the benefits greatly overweight the consequences. In essence, students would overall gain more being part of the schools community and working hard then not understanding the work given and sustaining a harder social life working at home.		0
Dear state senator,  We all are here today to right a letter to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral college, or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. The Elector College process consists of the selection of the Electors, the meeting of the Electors where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. It consists of 538 electors 270 elector votes is requiredto elect the president.  So? witch one do I think is the best. I agree to keep the Elector College because things are running ok for now but it think the the people of the United States should have a little more say so in the disitions made in america because we are the american peopele and we have the right to speak are mind, and if we dont think somthing is a good idea we should be able to tell the congrees we dont belive in that and choice somthing eles that more people agree on. The only thing i see wrong with every one getting to have a say so is that not every one agrees with one another.  I do agree that a bigger population shold get more elector votes but i dont thing it i far but it is what it is and i dont have a say so im ok with it. the only thing i have to say is its not right that the bigger populated states get the most etention they are the most important but i dont feel its right all states should be equal no mater there population size.  I dont think that they shold change the Election of popularity because instead of voting for the right thing we could just vote for the presedent that is offering the best stuff, and when presedents promise us stuff it dosent alwasy men there going to keep that promise. they keep promises to every one and they cant keep a promise to one person with out breaking that promis to another person. like i sai i think the elector college should just stay the same way as it is with thoughs little changes because it is working. but things stop working at some point and when that time comes we will need a new system.       ¬†       ¬†    		0
All over the world idea's of limiting car usage. In Vauban Germany 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own a car. Heidrum Walter said "When I had a car I was ALways tense. I'm much happier this way." In Paris they ban driving due to smog. Paris made some changes and Paris's congestion was down 60 percent in the capital france. Bogota, Colombia had a huge turnout on free-car day. The goal is to reduce smog violators and promote alternative transportation. Even in America, recent studies show fewer cars are being bought and less driving each year goes by. MIcheal Sivak said "I think that means something more fundamental is going on."  In Germany residnets in the suburban area are buying fewer cars. In this one community they are completely car free. The community is near the french and swiss borders. The surburban life is being adopted by public transportation with less space for parking and more space for stores and walk ways on main streets.  Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Motorists with odd or even license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home and if they did not listen they would be fined 22-euro ($31 dollars). Diesel fuel was blamed, since france has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Even though Paris has more smog than any other European capitals. The smog cleared on monday and for the ruling the French party banned odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.  Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took the buses to work on free-car day. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce their smog aswell. The turnout was large despite the gray clouds and rain. The day still went on has free-car day. Carlos Arturo said "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution and they have done just that.  In America recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less. This is good and bad. Only because the pollution rate is dropping and that is a good thing but the bad thing is the American car ownerships¬† are losing money. In New York the new bike-sharing program is skyrocketing because of the fewer cars being sold. The end of car culture is coming to an end and the time to change for the better is coming. One step at a time we can fix our mistakes with the pollution we started.       ¬†    		0
There have been an incredible amount of car accident caused by using cell phones while driving. There are about 421,000 people injured in 2017 by an accident caused by people that are described by people that are desecrated by looking at their phone. 1 out of 4 car accident is caused by texting and driving. So in response for the accident with a cellphone the government made new driving laws. In California there is now a law that states you cannot smoke and drive and also edibles even the passenger. Sometime people have different reaction time.  Because cannabis slows down your reaction is decreased by 21%.  Here are some helpful way to stay focus at all time when you driving. Try to talk to the person you see texting and driving to put down the phone while driving to ensure that every passenger is safe.14 % of people say they seen their parents on the phone. It has been studies to see who is more likely to get in an accident caused by texting. The studies have shown women are more likely to text and drive opposed to men drinking and driving. There are new apps for the phone that can stop all call and texts.  There are new laws that the government have made to put fear in people that like to use their mobile phone while driving.  So that people can stop creating a problem for drivers that use protective driving.  Craig hospital says '37 of the brain is distracted by a cellphone.                            		0
It's not a secret that we as humans use cars to get places. The mall, the grocery store, school, work. All these places may be too far to walk to, or just too much of a hassle to not use a car to get to. This is why vehicles have long been a main export and very commonly seen sight in the world. But what are they costing us? To name a few, vehicles are costing us clean air, time, and money that we are not going to get back easily, unless we change our bad habits. That's why limiting car usage is so beneficial to us as a population, not only for ourselves but for future generations as well. Putting a cap on driving will help us with the large amount of emissions that is put out every day, it will reduce jams and increase safety, and it will be less expensive. Cars are a dirty form of transportation that need to be controlled better.  Along the lines of dirty, cars give off a gross amount of emissions into the atmosphere. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States." Cars, because they are used so much and so densely in the world, give off the highest amount of carbon emissions, second only to power plants. This is detrimental to our atmosphere and puts a serious weight on the air around us. Smog has started to get to escalate the extremes. "After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." as stated by Robert Duffer in an article detailing the heavy smog that rivaled even Beijing, China, often known as one of the most polluted cities globally. The fiveday restriction on driving was implemented to, basically, give the air a rest after the intenseness of the trapped smog in the city reached 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter, compared with brussels 114 and London's 79.7. If we were to enforce this rule of reduced drivinhg everywhere, the amount of deducted pollution would be astronomical. It would be healthier for both the environment and for us humans.  Also being safer for humans would be the lower amount and intensity of traffic jams that would come with a restrictive hold on cars. With only exceptions for plugin cars, hybrids, cars carrying three or more people, and public transportation, traffic jams would be nearly nonexistent. Examples have already been seen in places where restrictions have been implemented. "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France," stated by Duffer of the ban on cars for the fiveday pollutuion scare. Another big example is written my Andrew Selsky, and he states, "In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or too buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of Bogota, Colombia eerily devoid of traffic jams." Densely populated cities and highways are extremey dangerous, both for cars that may get into accidents and for the pedestrians that may be present. With a reduction of cars, the danger of being hit is lowered greatly. It also saves time, due to jams and high volumes of traffic bogging of streets gone. Walking and biking would be safer, and for the few who drive smartly, such as with a hybrid, the traffic would be all but gone as well. Health expenses and potential hospital bills would be avoided, and ease of getting where you need to go would be stressfree and simple.  On the important topic of less expenses, this leads into the final claim. Along with the restrictions of cars use comes less expenses, something we all want. Elisabeth Rosenthal writes, "...the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explaination certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and apprears to be persisting now that the recovery is underway." This shows that the lessened use of cars has lead to an increase in money, and people are continuing to go through with this idea. Money is important to us, it is our lifeline in this cashoriented world. Without it, we live poorly, in all senses of the word.  To end off, driving is not something absolutely needed in our world. It strips us of smogfree environments, time, safety, and money. Putting a cap on driving will help us with the large amount of emissions that is put out every day, it will reduce jams and increase safety, and it will be less expensive in our daily lives. To reduce driving is to increse our standard of living.		0
Exploring Venus seems very interesting when thinking about it. All of the beneficial things that we can study and analyze. Studying other planets have always been helpful to mankind and helps people gain insight on our solar system around us. But at the same time exploring these planets are very dangerous too. Not because of animals or humans but because of the harsh living conditions on other planets. So I will tell you why I think exploring Venus is not worth the pursuit of exploring.  My first reason of why I think Venus is not worth the pursuit is because of the difficulty of exploring Venus. In paragrpah 6 it states that ships orbiting over Venus with lights can't see the ground because of the dense atmosphere. Which makes it hard for scientists because if you can't see anything you can't analyze any data that you get because of Venus's features. But it does state that NASA is trying to find new ways of exploring Venus but it's not as good as hands on exploration. Which is good but most likely not good enough to find out what they want about the planet.  My second reason of why I think Venus is not worth the exploration is because of Venus's conditions and features. When reading about Venus the conditions are very extreme compared to the conditions on Earth. Such as clouds filled with highly corrosive sulfuric acid or temperatures that average over 800 degrees. Making it the planet with the hottest surface temperature even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Also the atmospheric pressure is great enough to crush an accustomed submarine that would be able to dive into the deepest parts of the ocean and liquifies metals. But having similarities to Earth such as erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and etc.  So in conclusion I feel that Venus should not be a planet we heavily invest in and scientists should try other planets before Venus. Because of the harsh conditions that it would have on humans. Because of the difficulty in analyzation. Making Venus a non-reliable source compared to others. So that is why I think that Venus is not worth exploring. 		0
 The face on Mars is a fascinating topic that has captured the imagination of people across the world. The red planet has long been known to have a strange feature on its surface that resembles a human face. This feature has sparked various debates and theories about the planet's origins and even the possibility of life. In this essay, we will explore the different perspectives on the face on Mars.  One of the theories about the face on Mars is that it could be the result of a volcanic eruption. The volcanoes on the planet are known to spew out lava and other debris for miles, creating large craters and features on the surface. According to scientists, the face on Mars could be a result of this activity. The volcanoes on the planet are also known to be dormant for long periods and then suddenly erupt, creating large impacts on the surface. These impacts could have been responsible for the formation of the face on Mars.  Another theory about the face on Mars is that it could be the result of a meteor impact. If a large meteor were to strike Mars and create a large impact, the resulting crater could have been sculpted into the face we see on the planet today. The meteor impact could have caused the surface to erode and form the features of the face on Mars.  Some people believe that the face on Mars is evidence of intelligent life on the planet. The human-like features of the face have led people to speculate that there was once an advanced civilization on Mars that built the face. They believe that the face on Mars is a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of the Martian people. However, most scientists believe that there is no evidence of life on Mars.  In conclusion, the face on Mars is a fascinating topic that has sparked various debates and theories about the planet's origins and even the possibility of life. While some people believe that the face on Mars is evidence of intelligent life on the planet, most scientists believe that it is the result of natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions or meteor impacts. The face on Mars is still a mystery, and with continued exploration of the planet, we may one day unlock its secrets.		1
 Self-reliance is a concept that emphasizes the importance of individuals following their own instincts and ideas. However, while it is important to be independent, it is also crucial to have guidance and support from others. As the saying goes, "If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together." In my opinion, seeking guidance from experts and authorities can have a significant impact on our lives.  Firstly, having someone to guide you throughout the decisions you make in life can help you achieve your goals more efficiently. For instance, when I was in high school, I believed that I could accomplish my tasks faster by working alone. However, I soon realized that my classmates who worked in groups finished their assignments much more quickly than I did. This experience taught me the importance of seeking guidance from others to achieve my goals more effectively.  Moreover, working with experts and authorities can provide you with valuable knowledge and experience. For example, having a mentor or coach guide you can help you see different perspectives and gain insights from their experiences. This will enable you to learn and grow as an individual. Additionally, working with experts will give you the opportunity to learn from their mistakes and successes, which will help you make better decisions in the future.  Furthermore, experts and authorities can help you avoid making mistakes and wasting time. For instance, when I was in college, I was struggling with a particular subject. I decided to seek guidance from a professor who specialized in that subject. The professor was able to provide me with valuable advice and resources that helped me improve my grades and understand the subject better. This experience taught me the importance of seeking guidance from experts to avoid wasting time and energy on things that may not be beneficial in the long run.  In conclusion, seeking guidance from experts and authorities can have a significant impact on our lives. While self-reliance is important, it is also crucial to have support and guidance from others. By seeking guidance from experts, we can achieve our goals more efficiently, gain valuable knowledge and experience, avoid making mistakes, and ultimately lead a more fulfilling life.		1
Phone & Driving  It has always been a big concern on being on your phone, while driving. There are many bad outcomes from being on your phone while driving. You could possibly swerve off the road, crash into someone, or zoning out and not knowing what is going to happen next. Many people repeatedly still be on their phones while driving, while knowing what the outcome could lead to, and still not caring. Phones are a huge distraction while driving and no one seems to care what happens after.  Being on your phone while driving is not something that should be normalized. It can lead to one major problem, which is having an accident. When it comes to car crashes, and the cause of the crash is someone being distracted, is never a good look on the driver. Many people can lose their life, they can come out alive from the accident, but can still be traumatized to the point where they do not want, to ever get in a car again. 26% of most accidents are from texting while driving.  Another cause of being on the phone while driving, is a possibility of swerving off the road. No one ever wants to experience being a car alone, and next thing you know your trying to get back control of your car, from not being focused on the road. The outcome can be bad to the point where, you do not know where you are, may have lost your phone, and have no way of getting out because you are stuck. There have been nearly 390,00 accidents, caused from swerving while being on your phone. This could all be avoided if you just stay of your phone.  Finally, you could zone out, while on the road. When you are driving, your focus is the road. Zoning out while driving, and your phone can be a pretty ugly situation. You could possibly be intoxicated, and not knowing why, you on your phone and get carried away and zone out for a quick second, and next thing you know. You are in an accident. There are many ways to get an accident, but the common reason of accidents happening, is drivers being on their phone.  To sum up this unreasonable situation, do not be on your phone while driving. The outcomes can be you zoning out, which leads to an accident, swerving off the road, while being on the phone, and mainly just crashing into someone, while being on your phone. Whatever it is, it can wait, just for a good 10 minutes. It is never worth the risk of getting hurt.                  		0
I think that the Face they saw in 1976 was just a natural landform. I will be giving you at least 4 reasons why that's my conclusion. After you have listened to my reasons hopefully you will then think the same.  My first reason why I think it was just a natural landform is becasue first of all I am a scientist and I'm not suppose to think aliens and that kind of stuff exist. Secondly, on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor took a picture of Cydonia for the first time all they saw was just a natural landform. One of my other reasons why is becasue we thought it was just a Martian mesa, witch are very common in Cydonia. My last reason is becasue with the 3D high-resolution images from NASA's MGS it shows that it was just a mesa.  Those were all my reasons why I think it was a natural landform not an alien. Hopefully now you agree with me and think it was just a natural landform too. Also I hope that you have come to your senses and now think that aliens are not real.       		0
Many student's do not have opportunity to be part of one school. The school, or the study, are the most important thing for the future, because everyone depend of money, everybody need study to get a good job and make money. Each one know what want be in the future, so that is exactly whatever some need to study. Each person have those own personal problem's, therefore, not everybody have the opportunity to study in a school. In my opinion, class online is one benefit for every student and who want study.  Is a benefit having online class, since not everybody have the opportunity deform part of school. At this day's should be take in consideration the online class. Exist a lot of method to learn and can be which someone want to be. One of the cases for everyone should not going to the school are for the sickness. At this day's everyone be expose to any illness, that's one reason why online class is a good option. At this time study in the own house is a benefit; also working in the own house should be good thing. Is one option work in home when is bad climate¬†or include someone who can not going to work. In one part should be great going to work place because there are another people and is great know about the team work.  I consider important the study, since, is all the necessary for comply the desire purpose. That why exist a lot of manner for having the complete study online, or in the school. Also, exist the disadvantage of which online class have a high cost. That cause the low chance of opportunity to person's who not have the necessary budget to pay. I think we live right now the perfect example for study online, cause of all things happen in a different school's and also the illness that everybody are confront around the world. In the old year's people do not having help for study and make future plan. The new youth have a big opportunity for make future plan at this time.  Most people know that in this time the technology are the most important thing, therefore, it is possible do not be physical present in a classroom but can listening and see live class, basically the video conferencing. Having class in the own house should a good option because, give us more time to do the homework and study. Some student's who can be present in the school, need complete class, so student's use online class to comply that. Furthermore, is a good help to student's.  Finally, for my viewpoint will be a good benefit for many student's can study online. Taking consideration the problem's, and the different opportunity from each one, should be excellent option online class. People create another opportunity, showing that nothing is impossible for comply what people want. However is a benefit for all, having online class. It is necessary for what all can confront, and decide study online or physical in a school.¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
Some Schools require students to do a project over break. But should the project be student-designed, or teacher-designed? Projects over break should be student designed. For one, students could make there project on something they learned a lot about, and something they were interested in. Another reason students should pick there own project is that they will run wild with it. If you let them pick there own, they will try there hardest to make there project great, because it's something they connect well with and they want to show the Teacher. And finally, its over break, which really should mean that they are work free, so if your going to give them a project, at least make it one they can pick from.  If I were a student, and I was given a project over break, and you were told it had to be whatever they said, you probably wouldn't do it. And if you did, you probably had a little trouble getting all those facts. But if you were allowed to pick from something that you wanted, it would get done with ease. You could pick somthing you're comfortable with, and something that you learned a lot about. If the teacher picked it for you, and you didn't know a lot about it, you would have to start from scratch and do a lot of research, and that would waste a good break.  If you were to give a student a resticted project on somthing they have to do it about, they can only go so far with it. If they didn't know much about that subject, or if they just didn't really pay attention. They arn't going to do as well. But if you give a student a project based on what they want to do it on, they will be able to take it above and beyond. They will know so much about what they are presenting on, it will be like there own personal project, that they can even teach the Teacher about, because of how well they know it.  As a student right now, I know how awsome it is to have a break. Just some time to sit back, relax, clear your head from all the stress, and anxiety build up, and take some time off to enjoy yourself. But, I also know how it feels to have a break, and some teacher-assigned project thats due first day back. It is harder than normal school life, because you are trying to get that project done, that you only know a little bit about, and make time to enjoy yourself. Its more stressful then just going to school. But, if you are given a rubric, and you are allowed to make a project on whatever you want, you would be able to enjoy making it, and you would have that time to yourself.  In conclusion. A student-assigned project over break, would be a million times better, than a teacher-assigned one. There is not as much stress, because you know about what you are presenting on, and you can still enjoy your break, because thats what there for. So, maybe if you are given a teacher-assigned project over break, go talk to him/her about it. Tell him/her personally that, you would like to bring in a project based on what, you learned about.¬†		0
 The electoral college is a system used to determine the president of the United States. Under the constitution, the president is not directly elected by the people, but rather by a group of electors chosen by the states. The electors cast their votes for a candidate based on the candidate's popularity in their state. However, this system has been the subject of much debate and criticism over the years. Some argue that it is unfair and outdated, while others say it is necessary to ensure that the president is elected by the whole country, not just by large cities.  One of the main arguments against the electoral college is that it gives too much power to swing states. These are states that are not typically considered to be strongly red or blue and can go either way in an election. Swing states have a disproportionate influence on the election, as they can change the outcome of the popular vote simply by casting their electoral votes a certain way. This means that candidates often focus all of their energy on winning swing states, rather than on reaching out to voters in other parts of the country.  Another argument against the electoral college is that it does not accurately reflect the will of the people. This is because it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote, but still lose the election. For example, in the 2000 presidential election, Al Gore won the popular vote by over 500,000 votes, but he lost to George W. Bush in the electoral college vote.  Despite these arguments, there are those who believe that the electoral college is necessary to ensure that the president is elected by the whole country, not just by the largest cities or states. They argue that the system is fair, as it gives each state a proportional say in the election based on its population. Additionally, they argue that it prevents a candidate from winning the popular vote by campaigning only to large cities or states, thus neglecting the needs of the rest of the country.  In conclusion, the electoral college is a system used to determine the president of the United States. While it has been the subject of much debate and criticism, there are arguments on both sides of whether it works effectively. Ultimately, it is up to the voters to decide whether they want a system like the electoral college, or one that is fairer and more reflective of the will of the people.		1
 Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are becoming increasingly popular as technology advances and the demand for safer and more efficient transportation increases. While the concept of driverless cars has been around for years, recent advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensor technology have made them more practical and feasible for everyday use.  The main advantage of driverless cars is their potential to reduce accidents on the roads. Accidents are one of the leading causes of death in the world, and they are often caused by human error. Driverless cars use advanced sensors and AI algorithms to detect and react to obstacles, other vehicles, and pedestrians in real-time. This reduces the chances of accidents occurring and makes the roads safer for everyone.  In addition to safety, driverless cars can also improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. Traditional traffic flow models rely on humans to make decisions, which can lead to bottlenecks and inefficient use of roads. Driverless cars use sensors and algorithms to optimize traffic flow and make sure that everyone is moving efficiently and safely.  Driverless cars can also help reduce the burden on public transportation systems. Public transportation is often overcrowded and can be slow, which can discourage people from using it. Driverless cars can provide a personal and convenient alternative to public transportation, which can help ease traffic congestion on public transportation systems.  While there are many benefits to driverless cars, there are also concerns about their safety and reliability. One of the biggest concerns is the potential for hacking and cyber attacks on the systems that control the cars. There are also concerns about the potential for accidents due to technical malfunctions or errors in the software.  Despite these concerns, the majority of experts believe that driverless cars are safe and reliable, and will soon become a common sight on the roads. As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more driverless cars on the roads, which will bring with them many benefits for safety, traffic flow, and convenience.  In conclusion, driverless cars are an exciting technology that has the potential to bring many benefits to society. While there are concerns about their safety and reliability, the potential for accidents due to human error is significant. As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more driverless cars on the roads, which will help make our transportation more efficient and safe.		1
 Introduction  Driverless cars are an emerging technology that is poised to revolutionize the way we travel. They are an important innovation that will make our roads safer and reduce the amount of traffic congestion. However, the development of driverless cars is not without its challenges and concerns. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and disadvantages of driverless cars and argue in favor of their widespread adoption.  Body  One of the most significant benefits of driverless cars is their potential to reduce road accidents. With the use of advanced sensors and algorithms, these vehicles will be able to detect potential hazards and avoid collisions. This will reduce the number of accidents caused by human error, such as distracted or drunk driving. This technology has the potential to save thousands of lives each year.  Another advantage of driverless cars is their ability to reduce traffic congestion. By using intelligent transportation systems, driverless cars can communicate with each other and optimize the flow of traffic. This will reduce the time spent sitting in traffic, which can have a significant impact on productivity and the economy.  However, despite these benefits, there are also concerns associated with driverless cars. One of the main concerns is the high cost of this technology. The development and maintenance of driverless cars will require significant investment, which may be a deterrent for some consumers. Additionally, there are concerns about job displacement, as many jobs in the transportation industry may become obsolete with the introduction of driverless cars.  Conclusion  While the development of driverless cars is fraught with challenges, there are several compelling reasons why we should embrace this technology. From reducing road accidents to reducing traffic congestion, driverless cars have the potential to significantly improve our transportation system. While there may be some concerns about cost and job displacement, these challenges can be addressed through appropriate policy and investment. Ultimately, the benefits of driverless cars far outweigh their drawbacks, and we should move towards their widespread adoption.		1
Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.   While cell phones have become an integral part of modern life, they present a serious distraction when used behind the wheel. Texting, calling, or otherwise engaging with a phone takes a driver's eyes off the road for lengthy periods. Numerous studies show that even hands-free phone use significantly impacts reaction times and situational awareness. When operating heavy machinery like a multi-ton vehicle, any lack of focus or delay in reaction could have catastrophic consequences in an emergency.  Cell phone use impairs drivers in similar ways as drunk driving. Research demonstrates cell phone conversations reduce the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37%, comparable to a blood alcohol concentration at the legal limit. Given the danger of drunk driving is well established, it is logical and necessary to impose similar restrictions on cell phone use.  Banning cell phone manipulation does not prevent important communication, it simply forces mobile device interaction to stop during times a driver is controlling a vehicle in motion. With voice commands and hands-free options, any truly urgent calls or messages can still take place without manual interaction that diverts eyes and attention from the road. Delaying less time sensitive communication a few minutes until reaching a destination is a small sacrifice for safety.   The risks of cell phone enabled distractions far outweigh any personal convenience. Sharing the road with others means prioritizing their well-being above non-essential technology engagement, especially considering a momentary lapse in attention can easily turn deadly at highway speeds. For the protection of all drivers and passengers, cell phones should remain out of reach and out of use while a vehicle is in motion. Lives depend on drivers keeping their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.		1
Have you ever went on a camp out in the woods? Have you ever went camping out on water but for about 2 months? Now you can there is a progm that helps animals go to a different country. There are animals that need fed and you can do every night or even be a look out for whats coming ahead. The trip is fun but dangerous. You have to go on a boat that moves back and fourth. The fun part is that you can stay up all night and you get to never wake up unless its your job to feed the animals.  Luke's claims are having fun and being with his best friend. Luke also knew it would be a lif time opportunity. Luke was watching out for ahead and checking on the animals then he went to tell captin that when the ladder was wet and slippery. Luke fell and his heart pounding like a hammer. Luke was almost dead but he wasn't he broke a couple of ribs but hes fine he and work for a couple of days.  I dont know if i would join sounds fun too. Joining the prograhm was to help for world war ll also. The war was tough because there was a lot of stuff ruined by it too world war ll was a desaster but we thank the people that were in it. If you do join the progrhm they call you "A Seagoing Cowboy". Luke and his friend were happy that they were still alive. 		0
While the Face on Mars was an intriguing discovery that captured the imagination, upon closer examination the evidence shows it is a natural landform rather than artificial.   Some key claims supporting a natural origin include the differences in textures and shapes that are not uniform, as would be expected for an artificial construct. The article notes differences in heights, orientations and shapes of individual rock slabs that make up the "Face." This irregularity argues against intentional design and sculpting.   Additional evidence is how erosion and weathering over time could naturally form the patterns observers initially perceived as facial features. The ‚Äúcanyons ?and ‚Äúeye sockets ?described could easily result from existing fissures and cracks in the rocks being widened and deepened through environmental exposure. Images from later Mars orbits revealed these features blended smoothly into the surrounding terrain rather than having sharp defined edges. Natural weathering provides a plausible explanation without needing an intelligent cause.  One of the strongest pieces of evidence presented is how images from other angles revealed the ‚ÄúFace ?was simply a small isolated part of a much larger mesa formation. Seeing it in this larger context, it fits the natural landscape rather than looking deliberately constructed. The varying levels of erosion along the mesa, with the ‚ÄúFace ?region being more recessed and weathered, suggests this was merely an odd coincidental natural formation rather than an artificial construct.   In conclusion, while the sculpture-like appearance of the ‚ÄúFace on Mars ?captured the imagination of viewers, a closer scientific analysis argues it remains far more plausible this results from natural geologic processes rather than artificial construction by aliens or other sentient beings. The irregular patterns, blending into the surrounding terrain, and being merely part of a larger natural feature, strongly support it simply being a curious but coincidental natural landform rather than evidence of extraterrestrial visitation or ancient civilizations on Mars. For these reasons, the ‚ÄúFace on Mars ?does not provide convincing evidence for the theory it was produced by intelligent design.		1
Do you like going on fun adventures, saving lifes and vistiting many unique places? Well if you join or participate the Seagoing Cowboys program you will get to go to so many places like different countries,and castles. Not only that, But save lives in different countries. You will miss out on so many fun adventures and other peoples lifes and countries if you don't join the program.  If you join the program then you will have so much fun with all the different places and adventures. One of the people who come here, named Luke has been to so many beautiful places. Luke has made nine trips, more than any member in the Seagoing Cowboys. Luke has toured an excavated castle in Crete and went to the Panama canal on his way to China.  If it wasn't for Luke's friend, Don Reist,he would have never been a member and he would have never seen any of these places that he has been to. Luke knew it was an oppurtunity of a lifetime. At the time Luke joined, World war 2 was over in Europe. Many countries were ruined and needed help, so Don and Luke joined to go on a mission to go to other countries that were ruined to help the countries recover their food supplies,animals,and more.  "The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy," he says. Luke has gotten hurt for other people, because he knew that what was going on in their lifes,are far worse than his. He has traveled alot and seen alot that has happend in other countries, and they need more people to save them.  Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. "I'm grateful for the opportunity," he says. "It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs." That awareness stayed with him throughout his life. He lead his family and international students and exchanged visitors for many years. You can join this program and save lifes of other people in different countries,and visit countries and places just like Luke Bomberger and Don Reist.                   		0
The student body election was being held next week, and Generic_Name was anxious. She couldn't decide if she wanted to run or not, because she thought she wouldn't be good enough. She asked her friends, her parents, and even her older sister who was the vice president a few years back. They all gave her the same answer, and that answer was yes. The week of the election, Generic_Name raised her hand to be a candidate. Another girl name Generic_Name raised her hand as well. Anxiety swelled inside her. Generic_Name¬†had better grades, was more athletic, and was in all honors classes. What if she wasn't chosen? After an agonizing two weeks, the results came. Generic_Name had been elected to be the student body president! Just like Generic_Name, people hold themselves back from such great opportunities. People tend to self doubt, have no confidence in their selves, and argue continually whether they should do it or not until it's too late. Seeking the advice of others will help people make the right choices, receive advice from people with more experience, and have no self doubt.  Every action a person makes leads up to making a choice. Now, will it be a good choice, or a bad choice? It's up to that person to decide. People have a hard time making the right choice, like whether they should do their homework on time, join that club, be friends with those people, or even just debating whether they should take out the trash or not. They often have their own opinion, or just can't make up their minds at all. That's when asking someone else for advice comes in. Someone else always has a different perspective, and can see things the other person can't. That one person can help the other person realize what they should do. A person's friend could be telling them to join this friend group, although that person knows those people aren't the right friends for them. Asking another friend, or a guardian can help them clear that up and make the right decision.  When it comes to advice, people tend to ask their friends first. It's not a bad thing for people to ask their friends, but what about someone who's older and wiser than them? People who are older, like their grand parents for example, have been through more than them and will be able to help that person in need by giving them wiser advice. Another option is their parents. People's parents are the people who know that person the best, and knows what they need to succeed. Someone else they should consider is an older sibling who might've been in the same place that person has, and has great advice to offer to them. Teachers are a great choice too, for they are the ones who see that person every day at school, and knows what's best for them. If that person isn't in a school, perhaps they can ask their boss or colleagues who have worked far longer than they have. These people are sure to have words of wisdom that's worth listening to.  Finally, people have have self doubt. It's the feeling of whether they should try out for the team, enter that competition, audition for that play, etc. They are digging a hole deeper, and deeper of self doubt, and by the time they make up their mind to do it, they are stuck in the whole they made themselves. But someone can help them get out with a few simple words. 'You can do it.' 'You got this'. That causes a spark of hope that lights inside them, and that spark becomes a flame, and that flame becomes a raging fire that engulfs them in positive energy. Just asking a person and letting them tell the other a few encouraging words means a big difference to them. If the person never even asked at all, then they would be stuck all alone swallowed up in their own darkness, and self doubt, and what person would want that?  To sum it all up, asking other people for advice will help that person see what the right decision is, have wiser advice to assist them in making a choice, and have no clouded judgment against their self. They should stop thinking that they are right even though someone else other than them knows that whatever they think it wrong. That person right next to them could have some great advice to offer if they asked. People are never going to stop having problems on making up their minds, but asking another person for advice is something people should all do.		0
In today's fast-paced world, technology has become an integral part of our lives. One of the most significant changes that technology has brought to education is the ability for students to attend classes from home via online or video conferencing. While some may argue that attending classes in person is the only way to receive a proper education, I believe that this type of learning has numerous benefits that outweigh any potential drawbacks.  First and foremost, online and video conferencing classes allow for greater flexibility in scheduling. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, which means they can attend classes at a time that works best for their schedules. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for students who have jobs or other commitments that prevent them from attending classes during traditional school hours. Additionally, this flexibility can help students who have difficulty concentrating in a traditional classroom setting, as they can attend classes from a more comfortable and familiar environment.  Another benefit of online and video conferencing classes is that they allow for greater access to education. Students who live in remote areas or who have difficulty accessing traditional classroom settings can now attend classes from anywhere in the world. This is particularly beneficial for students who live in areas with limited educational resources, as they can now access high-quality education regardless of their location.  However, there are also some potential drawbacks to online and video conferencing classes. One of the biggest concerns is that students may struggle to stay motivated and engaged in an online learning environment. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may be more likely to procrastinate or miss classes. Additionally, online and video conferencing classes can be isolating, as students may feel disconnected from their peers and teachers.  Despite these potential drawbacks, I believe that schools should offer online and video conferencing classes as an option. The benefits of greater flexibility and access to education far outweigh any potential drawbacks. Additionally, schools can work to mitigate the potential drawbacks by providing students with the necessary support and resources to stay motivated and engaged in an online learning environment.  In conclusion, online and video conferencing classes offer numerous benefits that make them a valuable option for students. While there are some potential drawbacks to this type of learning, the benefits of greater flexibility and access to education make it a worthwhile investment for schools to offer.		1
Distracted driving is becoming a huge problem in the world today. One of the main distractions is something that most people have with them everywhere they go, it is known as the cell phone. Cell phone use while driving causes many wrecks and injuries every single year. In fact, the majority of crashes every year are caused by distracted driving, due to cell phone usage. This being said, people should not be allowed to use their cell phones while driving unless they have a hands-free option.  Many people believe that they are capable of multi-tasking. The main thing people think they can multi-task at is texting and driving. When you are behind the wheel you are always automatically expected to keep your full attention on the road. Failing to do so could result in something as minor as a ticket, or something as major as a wreck that could seriously injure or kill someone. Let's say that you're driving down a not so busy street in a neighborhood. You think that because the street is empty that you should be able to text and drive without any issues, so you pull your phone out to text your mom. You don't even have time to glance down and back up before you run into a solid brick mail box, causing the inflation of your airbags. When that airbag deploys, it causes fractures to your face, and blunt trauma to your cervical spine. Was it worth it?  According to many websites, at least 1.6 million accidents per year are due to texting and driving. Out of these accidents, around 3,500 people are killed and at least 421,000 people are injured. Many states now have laws that require you to be parked in a safe place before using your phone and failing to do so will result in a ticket. In most states you are not allowed to even have your phone on your person while driving. It must be put in a seat or in the console of your car out of reach.  There are reasons upon reasons as to why you should not be allowed to use your phone and drive. Many people don't realize, especially young people, that phone usage while driving can cause your insurance to go up a lot. I'm sure you'd rather put your phone down, than to have to pay extra each month because you had to use your phone. Another thing people don't realize is that when you are on your phone and driving, your reaction time is worse than if you were to be driving under the influence of alcohol.  Texting and driving should never be an option for anyone these days. We have so much hands-free technology, that you shouldn't even have to look at your phone while you are behind the wheel. No matter the situation or who the text is from, if you ever feel the need to pick up your phone, pull into a parking lot and make sure you're safe. Remember next time you put your car in drive and go to reach for your cell phone, how many lives, including your own, that you would be putting in danger.                                 		0
Driverless cars offer both opportunities and risks that must be carefully considered. According to the article, autonomous vehicles could help solve traffic problems and reduce accidents caused by human error. However, the technology also raises privacy concerns and may disrupt employment in transportation industries. On balance, I believe the potential benefits of driverless cars outweigh the challenges if certain measures are taken.  One major advantage of autonomous vehicles is improved traffic flow. The article notes that driverless cars could communicate with each other to travel more efficiently and avoid traffic jams. Without human errors like rear-ending other cars or making inefficient lane changes, traffic is likely to move at a steadier pace. This benefit could save both time and reduce emissions from idling vehicles. Furthermore, removing the human element from driving could diminish accident rates substantially. As responsible for over 90% of collisions, human error such as distracted driving, drowsiness or impaired judgement would no longer endanger lives on the road.  Of course, privacy issues arise if data from these connected cars is not properly safeguarded. As detailed in the article, personal information about passengers and their travel patterns could potentially be collected and misused without sufficient privacy protections. There is also a risk of job losses for commercial drivers like long-haul truckers. Still, new jobs may emerge to service and maintain these sophisticated vehicles. On the whole, the safety improvements and traffic efficiencies of driverless cars, in my view, outweigh these potential downsides if regulators establish cybersecurity rules and support retraining programs for displaced workers.   In conclusion, while autonomous vehicles present both opportunities and challenges, the likely benefits of increased road safety and reduced congestion through technology make them worth pursuing. With prudent oversight and precautions for privacy and employment impacts, driverless cars could help solve mobility problems and save lives. Overall, I argue the development of these cars should continue given the substantial positive effects if managed responsibly.		1

Hello my name is Generic_Name, my principle asked me my opinion on if every kid at school should join an extracurricular activity, such as a sport, a club, or scouts. But I don't think its a good idea. Some kids might not have time for that pointless activity they might have to get home fast and do chores or care for a loved one. It might be incunvenet¬†for there family's¬†too they might not be able to pick their kids up from the activity. Also, Most kids would be pretty mad to we are already in school for more than six hours out of the day.  Why I think its a bad idea is a very good question. Students at school can have fun for some kids but not all kids have fun at school some kids just put their heads down hoping the bell will ring sooner than it did yesterday. I think if those kids were forced to join an extracurricular activity they would be so miserable. They would proudly try to fake sick or always go to the to the nurse hoping to go home because they might be an introvert not liking crowds or human attention. Some kids might just want to go home to their families and or their pets.  Parents might get upset as well, they might not be able to go to the school and pick their kids up. This will make the kids sad and the parents a little mad. Then, parents might have to leave work early or hire some one to go pick the kids up and take them home. It would also not benefit the school ether parents would probably call the school constantly asking them to not make their kid go to the activity today and this would probably make the school uncomfortable with all the negative attention there getting.  Students who go to that school are probably be super grumpy, tired, and annoyed. They already go to school for over six hours a day adding more onto that is going to make them tired and mad. They are most likely just sleeping and not wanting to work on anything. Since they are sleeping in school it would cause them to not sleep at night then they are tired¬†the next day. It is a terrible cycle of sleeping in school. And there still kids let them go home and have their free time.  So all of this has been leading up to why school should let kids make their own choices. Give the kids an option if they want to join an extracurricular activity or not. Schools should accept the students choice and let the kids be kids. No matter if they want to go home¬†and watch TV, play video games, or just play sports with there families at home. Kids should be kids.		0
It is well known that cars have a significant impact on the environment. They contribute to air pollution, climate change, and noise pollution. In addition, cars are a major source of traffic congestion, which can lead to wasted time and fuel.  There are many advantages to limiting car usage. First, it can help to improve air quality. Cars emit a variety of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These pollutants can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and reduce the risk of these health problems.  Second, limiting car usage can help to reduce climate change. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the rate of climate change.  Third, limiting car usage can help to reduce noise pollution. Cars are a major source of noise pollution, which can disrupt sleep and concentration. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce noise pollution and create a more peaceful environment.  Fourth, limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion. Cars are a major cause of traffic congestion, which can lead to wasted time and fuel. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce traffic congestion and save time and money.  There are a number of things that we can do to limit car usage. One way is to improve public transportation. This can make it easier and more convenient for people to get around without a car. Another way is to build more bike lanes and sidewalks. This can encourage people to walk or bike instead of driving. We can also make it easier for people to work from home or carpool. These are just a few of the things that we can do to limit car usage and improve our environment.  In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car usage. It can help to improve air quality, reduce climate change, reduce noise pollution, and reduce traffic congestion. We can do a number of things to limit car usage, such as improving public transportation, building more bike lanes and sidewalks, and making it easier for people to work from home or carpool. By limiting car usage, we can improve our environment and make our communities more livable.		1
In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars however, the positive aspects outweight the negative aspects. Developing these cars can be an enormous help to everyone. They can notify the driver when the road needs human skills, sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer, and have the driver's seats vibrate when the car is in danger of backing up into an object. Being able to have these driverless cars will help to have more safe driving,  Having sensors and computer hardware and software helps drivers be notified of when they are needed to navigate "through work zones and around accidents." The driver's seat being able to vibrate to alert the driver of when they might back up into an object helps prevent accidents or crashes. These cars can also "steer, accelerate, and brake themselves," but still are designed to tell the driver when they are needed to do tasks only the drivers can do. The information coming from the sensors can cause the car to apply "brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control," than a driver can manage alone. Having cars be able to do such things like that help us in everyway they can.  Being able to develop these driverless cars will make everything much safer well, in driving. These cars can do anything a driver can do but still need a driver. Yes, you may ask if they are driverless cars then why do they still need a driver? Well, the answer is simple we need them because they still need to be able to work around crashes and navigating through work zones. "While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver," with this being said the car helps the driver as much as the driver helps the car. 		0
Finishing high school early or within the traditional four-year timeframe is a topic that has been debated for years. While there are advantages to finishing high school early, there are also disadvantages that must be considered. In this essay, I will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of finishing high school early versus the traditional four-year timeframe, and evaluate these pros and cons in comparison to the advantages of a four-year high school experience.  One advantage of finishing high school early is the financial benefits that come with it. By finishing high school early, students can save money on tuition and other expenses associated with college. Additionally, some students may be eligible for scholarships or financial aid that are only available to those who graduate early. This can be a significant advantage for students who may not have the financial resources to attend college without financial assistance.  Another advantage of finishing high school early is the educational opportunities that come with it. Students who finish high school early may be able to take advanced courses or pursue specialized programs that are not available to those who graduate in the traditional four-year timeframe. This can lead to a more well-rounded education and provide students with a competitive edge when applying to college or entering the workforce.  However, there are also disadvantages to finishing high school early. One potential risk is that students may not be fully prepared for the rigors of college or the workforce. While some students may be able to handle the increased workload, others may struggle to keep up. This can lead to academic failure or a lack of job performance, which can have long-term consequences for the student's future.  Another disadvantage of finishing high school early is that students may miss out on important social experiences that come with a four-year high school experience. High school is a time when students are able to form close friendships and develop important social skills. By finishing high school early, students may miss out on these experiences and struggle to make connections with their peers in college or the workforce.  In comparison to the advantages of finishing high school early, a four-year high school experience also has its own set of benefits. One advantage is that students have more time to explore their interests and pursue specialized programs or courses that align with their career goals. Additionally, a four-year high school experience provides students with a more structured and supportive environment, which		1
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student against extending the school day:  Ugh, do we really have to talk about this? I know some people think it's a good idea to extend the school day, but I'm here to tell you why it's not. First of all, let's be real, it's already super long. I mean, I know some schools go until like 4 or 5 pm, but that's just ridiculous. I'm already exhausted by the end of the day, and adding more time to it is just going to make me even more tired.  And don't even get me started on how it limits my free time. I mean, I already have to do homework and stuff after school, but if we have to stay longer, I won't have any time left to do the things I actually want to do. Like, I love playing video games and hanging out with my friends, but if I have to be at school longer, I won't be able to do any of that. It's just not fair.  And let's not forget about how extending the school day makes me hate school even more. I already don't love being there, but if we have to stay longer, it's just going to make me even more miserable. I'll be like, "Ugh, do I have to be here again tomorrow? Can't we just be done already?" It's not a good environment to be in, and it's not going to make me learn anything better.  I know some people might say, "But it will help you learn more!" But honestly, I don't think so. I mean, I already learn enough during the school day, and adding more time isn't going to make a difference. It's like, I get it, you want me to learn more, but there's only so much you can cram into one day. It's not like I'm going to magically become smarter if we stay in school longer.  So, yeah, I'm definitely against extending the school day. It's just not worth it. I'd much rather have a shorter day and have some time to myself after school.		1
Hi I am a scientist at NASA discussing the face on Mars with Jacob that thinks that the face was created by ailens. I will explain to Jacob that the face was not created by aliens beacuse us sientist figured that it was just another Martian mesa wich is commen around Cydonia but only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like it had a face. Our caption noted a huge rock formation wich made it look like a human face. Some authors reasoned that it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars by saying that aliens had created that human face on Mars.  We sent out a Global Surveyor to see and take a picture of the ''face". It arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997 18 years after the Viking mission ended. It would get a photo as soon as It can get it. When Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Mihael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When they took the photo thousands of web surfers were waiting to see the image. When they saw the image they saw that it was only a land form. There was no alien monument after all.  As you can see if there where objacts in this picture like a house or something else you would be able to see it on this picture. What the picture actually shows is a Martian butte or mesa that are landforms commen around the American west. It remids me of the Middel butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho. 		0
Dear Principal,  We shouldn't be required to do community service unless we absolutely need to. Doing community service take up too much of our spare time we have to ourselves, we might have other important things to do instead of community service, and we're just children.  One of the reasons is, it takes up too much of our spare time. Our spare time is the only time we have to ourselves that we can actually enjoy. With that time, we can just have fun and enjoy ourselves. We can watch movies or play video games.  Another reason is, we could have other important things to do. Instead of community service we could be doing something else productive. Such as chores at home or just helping out friends with things they need help on. Also students may have assignments that they need a lot of time to finish.  Most importantly, we're just children. As kids we should be able to enjoy our life and act like actual kids. We should have the decision to have fun. Kids should feel free to play and have fun with friends and family.  So those are reasons why students should not be required to do community service. It takes up too much of their spare time, we may have other important things to do, and we're just kids. So we shouldn't be given so much work to do.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
Dear,  Mr. Senator  I am a student at SCHOOL_NAME, and in my opinion we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United Stastes. Thats my opinon because you would know excacly how many people actually picked the president of the united states. Some people might make a mistake and pick somebody they don't want so if you do it by paper, and give people what the president will do for us peolpe might make the right choise.  So if you really feel the need of taking down the collage go ahead and do it. It will be better and in the future we can make another one and make it bigger and better then the one we have right know. It might hurt some people I know that, but once we get the new one they won't be so dissaponited because you got ridd of the old one. So make a good choise. Most people say "but it is like a home to me" they might be saying that because thats what everybody says so take that one down and build a bigger and better one¬† then the one we have today.  I know there is the bigger states but¬† you can always split it boys one one side and all the girls on the other .  Look at obama he was suppose to make are country a better place but he is making it worse. so maby if we get a look at them and they tell us what they are going to do right in front of us we might pick a president that is acually going to do what he says, and not make our school lunch so horribale and so little. I'm not tring to be mean to Mr. Obama but he said he was going to make change we all thought it was going to be good change but NO he is making the biggest mistakes. I know we wall make mistakes but he said he was going to make change and so far he is making bad changes.  I'm not saing he is bad president but he said he was going to make change i just wish it was good and not bad. I have lived in the united states all my life and I have never seen this much bad change. I hear alot of bad stuff like world war 3 going to happen and i think to my self and think is this whta the world has came to.  So let's make the good choise and lets get ridd of that collage.  With all do respect,  Miriannette Reyes       ¬†¬†¬†       ¬†¬†¬†¬†       ¬†       ¬†    		0
While facial expression recognition technology holds some promise, using it to read students' emotions in the classroom raises serious ethical concerns that outweigh its potential value. On one hand, this technology could help teachers understand how students are feeling in response to their lessons in real time. By detecting signs of boredom, confusion or frustration, teachers may be able to adjust their teaching approach to better engage different learners. However, this type of constant emotional monitoring also poses risks to students' privacy and autonomy.   Continuously analyzing students' facial expressions without their consent could undermine their sense of psychological safety at school. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing that a computer system is scrutinizing their every fleeting expression and inward feeling. This could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas in the learning environment. Students' emotional responses to certain topics like religion, politics or personal issues might reveal sensitive aspects of their identities or perspectives that they did not intend to share so broadly. Constant monitoring also could create performance pressure and stress for students who worry about having their emotional reactions judged and recorded.  Perhaps most concerning is that facial expression analysis is still an imperfect science. The computer system may misinterpret students' emotions or draw incorrect conclusions based on incomplete data. Students would have no way to correct misleading labels applied to their emotional states. Errors and lack of context in the system could negatively impact students' relationships with teachers or even their academic records over time. Before deploying this kind of technology, more research needs to be done to ensure it will not do students more harm than good or unfairly categorize them based on surface-level cues.   In summary, while facial recognition technology offers potential instructional benefits, its risks to student privacy, psychological well-being, and potential for inaccuracy outweigh those benefits in an educational setting for now. More precautions and oversight would need to be in place to establish an ethical framework for its use among developing youth. Overall, the cons likely surpass the pros when it comes toemotionally monitoring students without consent through this new means. School is meant to be a safe place for learning and growth - not constant emotional surveillance.		1
What would you do if you were forced to participate in an after school activity? I would be really mad because I don't like to stay after school, and I don't want to participate in anything. I'd like to go home and get some rest after using my brain for 7 hours straight. I disagree with this, because I think students shouldn't be forced to participate in an extracurricular activities if they do not want too and some people's families may not even have enough money to pay for thing's they would need for the activities. I think if the principal did this then he would get complaints from the parents of the kids of them not getting the activity they wanted.  One reason I disagree is because, you shouldn't be forced to take anything you don't want to take. Say you chose soccer but they didn't have any room left for you so they moved you into basketball, and you really dislike basketball, How would you feel? Families may not have enough money to buy you equipment for these activities. Finally, I think it should be a choice for students to see if they want to take any of the classes, they shouldn't be forced to take one.  .  .  .		0
I disagree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities can benefit students, not all students will have time for or interest in them. Some students may need to focus on academic studies or have family obligations or jobs after school. Forcing involvement takes away students' freedom to choose how to spend their free time.  It is true that participating in extracurricular activities can teach valuable skills like teamwork, leadership, time management and more. However, not all students have the time or ability to dedicate to clubs or sports. Some students may need to spend afternoons and evenings doing chores at home, caring for siblings, or working part-time jobs to help support their families financially. Mandating extracurricular involvement would create undue stress on these students who have important responsibilities outside of school.   Additionally, not every student has interests or talents that align with the activities offered by the school. A student who loves playing video games may not enjoy any sports teams or academic clubs. Obligating this student to join something they have no passion for could diminish their enjoyment of school. Forced participation is unlikely to build skills and character in the same way that voluntary involvement based on personal motivation would.  Rather than making extracurriculars compulsory, the principal's goal of developing well-rounded students could be achieved by encouraging involvement and providing diverse options. The school could promote the benefits of getting involved and help students find opportunities that suit their abilities and interests. But the final choice should remain up to each individual student and their family based on considerations like schedule, priorities and skills. Not all learning happens in organized after-school programs, and students' free time deserves respect as well.  In conclusion, while extracurricular activities offer benefits, mandating participation deprives students of personal freedom and choice over how to spend their out-of-school hours. The principal's goal is well-meaning but this policy goes too far in removing students' autonomy. A voluntary, encouraging approach rather than an obligatory one would respect each student's unique responsibilities and passions.		1
When I was in high school, I remember how indescribable it felt to have a guidance counselor who was genuinely interested in my success and well-being. With their help and guidance, I felt like I had a mentor who could help me take my next steps. It even helped me feel supported during the challenging transition to college. That experience planted a seed in me that I would one day like to become a guidance counselor and help other students the same way my guidance counselor helped me.   I believe that as a guidance counselor, I bring a balanced combination of empathy and knowledge - in addition to having my own personal experience of being in the students' shoes - that will enable me to be an effective mentor for my students. My primary goal is to support and empower students to reach their true potential and open as many opportunities as possible. I am committed to connecting them with resources, offering advice, and helping them access the educational and career paths that fit them best.   It is essential to seek help from a guidance counselor. Support from outside is invaluable and provides a different perspective. Guidance counselors work hard to get to know each student personally and offer individual and tailored advice. Through collaborations between teachers, family members, and friends, guidance counselors can be a bridge to an overall sense of stability and direction.   My passion and dedication to helping students make successful life decisions is why I want to become a guidance counselor. I believe that, with the right help, students can grow and develop into their best versions and ultimately, have successful lives.		1
Dear Mrs. Principal,  I believe that you should allow the students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and free periods as long as they are off during class. I believe this should be the policy our school has because during free periods and lunch phones do not disrupt anything they just keep kids occupied. The kids might also need to use their phones to call parents to organize pickups and drop offs. If you have a serious enough punishment for having phones on during class then kids will be afraid of using their phones. I believe you should allow students to use phones during free periods and lunch as long as they are off during classes.  During free periods it does not matter if students use phones because they are not usually doing anything educational. Phones could actually keep them occupied from doing things like vandalizing. During free periods students often find themselves not doing anything, and when students are bored they sometimes make trouble. Students might actually need to use phones to organize pickups and drop offs with parents.  If you make a serious punishment like detention for having phones on in class students would most-likely think the risk of getting caught is to great. They will also probably think it is not worth it to read the one text that they got since they last checked. What is the point of not letting student use phones during free periods, they are not doing anything anyway!  Not letting students bring phones to school is not a good idea. It is better that students use their phones than go and vandalize the bathroom! If there is a punishment for using phones then student will not want to risk looking at their phones. I think you should allow students to bring phones to school if they don't use them during class.  Sincerely,  A Concerned Student		0
Thomas Jefferson believed that hard work was essential for achieving success in life. He wrote, "Diligence is the mother of good luck." To him, hard work meant taking control of one's life and seizing every opportunity to make progress.  Indeed, history is marked by examples of those who achieved greatness due to their dedication and hard work. From scientists like Albert Einstein, to explorers like Captain James Cook, their success was driven by their commitment to their goals despite all the obstacles in their way.  Hard work and intelligence are often two sides of the same coin when it comes to success. While intelligence helps steer one down the right path, hard work is the vehicle that propels one forward. The old adage "where there's a will there's a way" rings true  ?hard work ensures that little stands in the way of achieving one's ambitions.  When it comes to safety and security in life, hard work plays an essential role. Hard work gains credibility, respect and trust, all things needed to achieve stability. Hard work prepares one for self-sufficiency, be it financially, occupationally, or practically. Hard work can help make sacrifices and inconvenience worthwhile, as it can lead to long-term progress.		1
When people hear the word transportation, the first most likely thing that comes to ones mind is car. It is typical to think of a car as just a way to get from one place to another faster, but what about the effects of driving. Cars are one of many things that cause pollution, releasing gases that harms our Earth we live on, the very planet that keeps us alive. Limiting car usage could benefit the earth and give you advantages.  "Paris bans driving due to smog," by Robert Duffer, the title it self says all, paris has a pollution issue due to the cars that they drive and stated in the article because of "nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." Because of the actions Paris had to make it reduce the congestion in the capital of France by 60 percent, those who didn't follow to what was told "suffer a 22euro fine," about "4,000 drivers were fined" according to Reuters. We shouldn't only resort to cars as transportation, inventions such as the bicycle are still around to this day and the percentage rate of bicycles causing pollution is, zero.  Author Andrew Selsky states in his article, "Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota," that millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during the carfree day." This day was done so it can encourage people of alternative transportation and reduction of smog, and according to the article some may say it works. "It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" Stated by business man, Carlos Arturo Plaza.  The advantages and possibility people could have if they limited the usage of vehicles, in Duffers article it is proclaim that "parks and sport centers also bloomed through out the city." The once beated up side walk, is now restored with "broad, smooth sidewalks," and coming back to the congestion, "rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic." There possibilities bloom with the upscale of shopping districts and new restraints increasing.  It is understandable for one to not like the idea of reducing the usage of ones car, but if you sit back and realize it, cars are "responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emission" and thats just in Europe. In the United State, there percentage increases to 50 percent. All according to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article, In "German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars." Beijing, Chine is guilty of being the "most poplluted cities in the whole world." Everyone is a culpret when it comes to poplution and that is why everyone should take time to look at the facts and change, help the earth that helps you. Instead of driving your car to work thats just down the street, take a bike, If not take a shuttle. Don't relie on one source of transportation.  The opportunitys that could accore if one just limit the usage of his or hers motor vechile are endless, but it all starts with a choice. Rethink the way you see cars, think about the effect and possibilities that could offend mothernature. The advantages such as building cardio and decreasing of stress and pollution. The time to change the amount of times we use our car is now because limiting the usage of cars is right, and when you give to the planet the planet gives back.		0
 Dear Senator,  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College and its role in choosing the President of the United States. I strongly believe that the Electoral College is an essential part of our electoral system and should be retained.  One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is that it provides a sense of certainty in the outcome of the election. While it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election, this has only happened a handful of times in U.S. history. In contrast, a dispute over the outcome of a popular vote is much more likely to occur.  Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that a candidate must appeal to voters in multiple regions in order to win the election. This is desirable because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.  The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This is because the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes means that even a small plurality in a state can create a landslide victory. This ensures that voters in toss-up states are given the most attention and consideration during the campaign.  Additionally, the Electoral College helps to restore some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This is important because large states have a greater impact on the election than smaller states.  Finally, the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This can be a complicated and chaotic situation, and the Electoral College helps to avoid this problem by producing a clear winner.  In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Electoral College is an essential part of our electoral system and should be retained. It provides certainty in the outcome of the election, requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal, encourages candidates to focus on swing states, restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose, and avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
The Face isn't made by aliens becuase it is just a natural land form, and if we look at pictures taken be our spacecraft is will show us it is not a face. Also the Face was proven to be just a land form by Global Surveyor when it took a new picture in 2001.  The face is also not alian made becuase if it was there would be more then just a face to prove that they were there. Also scientists can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size to see if the picture was right and that it's not a face. Also another thing is the picture actually shows that it is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa that are landforms common around the American West.  Another reason it could have looked like a face is the took a picture of the Face on Mars and its located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. Witch means the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Witch could have messed up the picture. The new picture was taken on Nevertheless April 8, 2001¬óa cloudless summer day in Cydonia¬óMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look at the face. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin¬ís team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera¬ís absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Before they got that picture they had to do alot of hard work.  Heres what the did, Mission controllers prepared to look again. they said It¬ís not easy to target Cydonia. In fact, it¬ís hard work. Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. They just don¬ít pass over the Face very often. The first time they took the pickture it wasnt that good of a picture. This is what happened before they got the good photo. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. It was a better photo then the first one taken by the viking but it had a glare and wasn't as good as the second one.  This is why the face isn't an alien artifact, and it is also why it is not being looked at alot and observed. The Face is just a natural landform on mars that is sorta like a butte or mesa¬ólandform found around the American West. It alo kinda looks like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The Middle Butte a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Thats why Its not Alien it is just a natural land form.		0
Online school can be beneficial in many ways, but is it worth it? Many students take online school, but aren't getting the important skills they need in life such as communicating and collaborating, others believe that online school is beneficial because of how flexible it is and the amount of work the student is required to do.  Going to school can give you more practice on life skills such as communicating. In school kids are prepared with communication skills such as working with other students on a project or communicating with their teachers about a missed assignment or a missed test. Communication is used everyday in life. While in school from K-12, students are taught to communicate what they want and what they need. Students are taught to communicate if they need help, because if they don't it is a downward spiral to their learning. Communicating is very important in working with others and in the work foce, without that important skill, life becomes very difficult.  Going to school also provides the skill of collaborating. Many kids who go to school receive more practice through school work and presentations. Whether it is just working with someone on class work or even working on a presentation. Many teachers will assign classwork, or projects that give the student the option to work with another person or alone, but sometimes the teacher won't give the option to work alone and make it mandatory that you work with another classmate. Working with another student gives the students the opportunity to both take their ideas and put them together to complete the task at hand. Collaborating in school gives the student the practice they need when they enter the real world. Collaborating is very important in life and is used everyday, especially in the workforce.  Others believe that online school is best for a student, because of the flexibility it gives the student and the amount of work the student is given. Taking online school gives the student the freedom to work on their own schedule throughout the day and turn in work when they want by the time the work is due. Online students are also give the opportunity to have more breaks, where as going to school the only break the student gets is lunch time. Online students have the flexibility to wake up later and work to their speed. While students in school have a set time to arrive at school, what time to go to certain classes, and how fast they gotta work. The workload compared from online school and in school are very different. In school if a student has an assignment done, the next thing they know, they have another one for them to do. On top of that students usually go home with homework after that. While online schools work load is far less. Once the student completes their lesson for that class they are done for the day.  In conclusion, online school has many benefits such as flexibility and work load. While going to school has a far greater benefit, with preparing the student for the real world with life skills such as communication and collaboration. Many students take online school, but they aren't getting the important skills they need in life such as communicating and collaborating, others believe online school is very beneficial because of how flexible it is and the work load being much lower than going to school.¬†		0
Luke made a good choice to go to China so he could help do stuff and help other people and help with World War 2. He could also help the horses and protect the horses and train them. He could also do stuff people couldn't do or help the people that need help or he could also protect the people that are hurt and take them to the nurse or the hospital. He has a good reason to go to China and protect people he could help his friend do stuff or he could do it for him and he could also fight with people and he could fight the other Country and he could also give people the horses of they need them. His friend had a good reason to take Luke with him to China so he can do a lot of stuff with him. It is a opportunity of a life time for Luke. Luke was excited to go to China to help other people and train horses and fight vs other Countrys and help people that are hurt also ride horses with his frinds and have a lot of fun with his friend. It took him two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean and it took him a month to get to China and when he got there he was so excited to be there so he can fight and ride horses and train them. He had no idea his life was going to change. it was when he graduated high school then his friend asked him if he wanted to go to China. When he was asked he couldn't of said no so he couldn't feel bad. He went to the Atlantic Ocean sixthteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice.		0
Dear Principal,  There are rumors going around that you might make it mandatory for the students at the school to perform community service hours. I believe that it may be helpful for some students to perform community service because it could keep them out of trouble or serve as their punishment for misbehaving regularly but it could also hinder some students. Some students at the school are well behaved but aren't doing well with their grades. So instead of performing acts for the community they could be studying to improve their grades. With the improvement of grades in the school the students will most likely have less stress on getting their homework finished or working in class and will be more attentive in class.  Another reason not to have community service is that some students have activities outside of school. Sports is a very important activity to some athletic students in the school because that is how some of them are paying for college. If you take that away from them then they might not get a scholarship to the college that they want.  If we do have community service then it should be for students that are doing excellent in schoolwork but not make it mandatory. To make students that are doing well enough in school want to work for the community, there should be a reward for the most hours performed. This way if the students not doing well in all of there classes want to earn the reward they will work harder to do well and get in the race for the prize. The entire school's grade point average will raise if they are willing to work for the prize.  The prize should be something grand and well thought out. It could be a certificate to a restaurant or a few concert tickets. If the entire school does well enough, we should be able to go on a "fun field trip."  With these ideas there will possibly be many community service hours performed and grades improved. Please take this letter into thought when you decide on making community service mandatory or not.  Sincerely,  A concerned student.		0
Online classes or video conferencing it is one of the many opportunities that some school offer, for those who have a full time job and they really have the volunteer to graduate but they doesn't have the time to attend to school,they still can graduate, taking online classes and complete the credits that they need...  for example: my bother is taking online classes because he works full time,¬†and wants to support the family at the same time.  Students are going to be more than benefit because they will have the opportunity to finish their classes.  The program distance¬†learning has many advantage:  the students will have more space and time to review the same, if they did not understood it.  they will have more privacy they will have a flexible schedule, and they can take the class when they want.  they will not miss any class for any weather changes, etc.  Personally I think that is a great opportunity for us, because if we are not able to attend at school, the school gave us the opportunity to take online classes that way we can finish our classes and to graduate, also it is not like that you have to be there an specific time.		0
At the beginning Luke bomberger did not know when his life would change sooner or later when he got a little older. Luke had two part time jobs one of them was at the grocery store the second one was at the bank, then his friend Don Reist came and told Luke if he want to come with him in a adventure to go to the Europe on a cattle on a boat. So that is when he said to him self ''this could be the moment I had been waiting for in a long time''. They both needed supplies to have a life time. Finally the Seagoing Cowboys were hired by the UNRRA to take good care of the horse, young cows, and also the mules that all of them were shipped overseas. When he was 18 years old he thought it was a good idea to join the military service. He choose to go to the military service before he came to Greece. But he didn't choose to be in the military service. So they still traveled it took two weeks cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eats cost of united state and it also took about a month to get to China. So when are carrying the animals it is harder to travel. But for Luke was more than a adventure it opened up his world into seeing stuff. He said '' I am grateful for the opportunity that I had''.		0
January 27, 2011  Dear Principals,  You know how these texting in class and calling and being not responsible... Well I think that policy 2 is the best policy. This reason is because students can be more focused on their work more than phones , students want be distracting other kids , and most importantly is that they need to have a good GED when they get in high school. I think we should have a election. I know back in a few grades I used to text and everything but I have learned my lesson. I have had bad grades and you don't want that. But the main thing im trying to get to here is that, texting should not be allowed in class like what policy two said. I think that is jus plain dumb. Im just trying to persuade you to not let texting go on during class. Also im conserned about my other class mates.  Well I hope if anyone else writes you . That they feel the same way I do . Well got to get back to my school work. That is what's best for me!  Your Friend, STUDENT_NAME		0
I personally believe that we should transition to renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydro power. There are several reasons why I believe this is the right choice for our society.  Firstly, renewable energy sources are much cleaner and do not produce harmful pollutants like fossil fuels do. They also do not release greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change and global warming. By shifting towards renewable energy, we can help to reduce our carbon footprint, and protect our planet for future generations.  Secondly, renewable energy is a more sustainable option because it is derived from natural, replenishable resources. Unlike oil, which is a finite resource, renewable energy sources are constantly being replenished by the sun, wind, and water. This means that we can rely on them for the long-term without worrying about depleting our natural reserves.  Finally, investing in renewable energy is a smart economic choice. The cost of solar and wind energy has dramatically decreased in recent years, making it much more affordable compared to fossil fuels. Renewable energy also creates more jobs in fields such as manufacturing, installation, and maintenance, which can boost our economy.  In conclusion, I strongly advocate for a transition to renewable energy sources. Doing so will help us protect the environment, create sustainable energy sources, and improve our economy. It's time for us to embrace a cleaner, more sustainable future.### Instruction:  I disagree with your opinion, I think that renewable energy is too expensive and not efficient enough to be our primary source of energy. What do you have to say about that?### Response:  I would say that while renewable energy may have been more expensive and less efficient in the past, that is no longer the case. the cost of solar and wind energy has dramatically decreased in recent years, making it much more affordable compared to fossil fuels. in addition, renewable energy technologies are constantly improving and becoming more efficient. furthermore, we have to consider the long-term costs of using fossil fuels, including the environmental damage they cause and the health problems they can lead to. while there may be some upfront costs associated with transitioning to renewable energy, the long-term benefits and cost savings make it a smart investment for our future.		1
 Online classes have become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. Graduating high school is a crucial step in a person's life, as it can open up many opportunities for further education and employment. However, not all students have the same resources or circumstances that allow them to attend traditional in-person classes. For these students, online classes can be a lifesaver.  One of the biggest advantages of online classes is the flexibility they offer. Students can complete their coursework at their own pace, on their own schedule. This is particularly beneficial for students who have to balance school with other responsibilities, such as working part-time or caring for family members. By allowing students to complete their coursework at home, online classes can help to alleviate some of the stress and pressure that comes with traditional in-person classes.  Another advantage of online classes is that they can be tailored to the individual needs of each student. Students who learn at their own pace can take advantage of online resources and materials to learn at their own pace, without feeling like they are falling behind in class. Additionally, students who have specific learning needs or disabilities can often find more accommodations and support in an online learning environment.  Online classes can also be a great way for students to explore their interests and career goals. Many students are unsure of what they want to do after high school, and online classes can provide them with the opportunity to try out different courses and subjects without committing to a specific major or program. This can help students to make more informed decisions about their future education and career path.  Overall, online classes offer a number of benefits that can make them a valuable option for students who are unable to attend traditional in-person classes. By providing flexibility, accommodations, and opportunities for exploration, online classes can help to ensure that all students have the chance to succeed and achieve their goals.		1
 A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves  The Wild West and the seas are two vastly different worlds, but they share one commonality: the spirit of adventure. One cowboy who was known for his adventurous spirit was a man named Bull Whip Bill. Whip Bill was a cowboy who had traveled across the American West, working as a ranch hand and cowboy before venturing out to sea to ride the waves on a daring journey.   Whip Bill's journey began when he left his life as a cowboy behind and set sail for the gold mines of the Klondike. The treacherous waters of the North Atlantic proved to be no challenge for this seasoned cowboy. With his trusty bullwhip in hand, Bill battled against raging storms and towering waves to reach his destination. Once he arrived, he quickly made a name for himself as one of the most skilled gold miners in the region.  As the years passed, Whip Bill's adventures on land and sea continued to capture the attention of the public. He was interviewed by newspapers across the country for his tales of survival on the high seas, and his exploits were featured in countless books and magazines. Whip Bill had become a legend, and his name was synonymous with bravery and adventure.  Despite his success as a gold miner, Whip Bill never lost his love for the cowboy life. He would return to the West periodically to ride his horse and roam the open plains. He would often stop at old ranches to share stories of his experiences on the sea, and his tales were met with amazement by everyone who heard them.   Whip Bill was truly a cowboy who rode the waves. He was a man of many talents, who used his skills on land and sea to create a storied legacy. Whip Bill's journey is a testament to the spirit of adventure that is present in all of us. His life serves as an inspiration for anyone who dares to dream big and pursue their dreams, no matter what challenges they may face along the way.   In conclusion, Whip Bill was an exceptional cowboy who was known for his bravery and adventurous spirit. His journey from the cowboy trails of the West to the gold mines of the Klondike and back again, demonstrates the limitless possibilities of the human spirit. Whip Bill's legacy serves as an inspiration to us all, a reminder to never give up on our dreams and to always remain determined to pursue them, no matter what obstacles may stand in our way.		1
Climate change is a real and pressing issue that affects us all. It's like, the earth is getting hotter and hotter, and it's all because of humans and their pollution. I mean, have you seen the videos of the polar bears struggling to find ice to stand on? It's so sad. And it's not just the animals, it's also affecting people. Like, there are droughts and floods and stuff, and it's all because of the changing climate.  So, I think that governments should totes take immediate action to address climate change. They need to, like, make laws and regulations to reduce carbon emissions and stuff. And they need to invest in renewable energy sources, like solar and wind power. That way, we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and stuff.  One reason I think this is important is because, like, the earth is our home. And we need to take care of it, you know? It's like, we wouldn't trash our own homes, so why are we trashing the planet? And it's not just about us, it's about future generations too. We need to make sure that they have a healthy planet to live on.  Another reason is that, like, climate change is already having a big impact on our lives. I mean, have you seen the news lately? There are like, wildfires and hurricanes and stuff, and it's all because of the changing climate. And it's not just in other countries, it's happening here too. Like, there was that big flood in Toronto a few years ago, and it was all because of the heavy rainfall caused by climate change.  And it's not just about the environment, it's also about the economy. Like, investing in renewable energy sources can create new jobs and stuff. And it's not just about the money, it's about the future of our planet. We need to take action now, before it's too late.  But, some people might argue that, like, taking action on climate change will hurt the economy. They say that reducing carbon emissions and stuff will make it harder for businesses to operate and stuff. But, I think that's not true. I mean, there are already lots of companies that are using renewable energy sources and stuff, and they're doing just fine. And it's not just about the companies, it's about the people too. We can all make a difference by, like, using public transportation or biking instead of driving, and stuff.  In conclusion, climate change is a real and pressing issue that we need to take action on now. Governments should totes take immediate action to address climate change, by making laws and regulations to reduce carbon emissions, investing in renewable energy sources, and stuff. It's not just about the environment, it's about our future and the future of our planet. We need to take action now, before it's too late.		1
In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. There are many reasons for this, including the environmental impact of cars, the cost of car ownership, and the health risks associated with driving.  One of the most important reasons to limit car usage is the environmental impact of cars. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. They also produce other pollutants, such as air pollution and smog. These pollutants can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer.  Another reason to limit car usage is the cost of car ownership. Cars are expensive to buy, maintain, and insure. They also require parking, which can be expensive in urban areas. The cost of gas has also been rising in recent years, making it even more expensive to drive.  Finally, there are health risks associated with driving. Drivers are at risk of accidents, which can be fatal or cause serious injuries. They are also exposed to air pollution, which can cause respiratory problems.  There are many ways to limit car usage. One way is to walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving. Another way is to carpool or take a ride-sharing service. Many cities also have programs that encourage people to use alternative transportation, such as free or discounted public transportation passes.  Limiting car usage can have many benefits. It can help to improve air quality, reduce noise pollution, and make cities more livable. It can also save money and improve people's health. If you are interested in limiting your car usage, there are many resources available to help you. You can find information about alternative transportation options, carpool programs, and other ways to reduce your driving.  In conclusion, there are many reasons to limit car usage. Limiting car usage can help to improve the environment, save money, and improve your health. If you are interested in limiting your car usage, there are many resources available to help you.		1
Dear principle,  It would be fare to other kids if you put " you cant play any sports unless you have a B average or more". so many kids probably couldn't play their favorite sports and their parents would get mad enough to have them switch schools. lets put it this way, if you say they can have a C average in their grade the school would be a lot better place and wouldn't be as boring as it is. you could have a really good athlete who does every sport and is a super good running back for the team, real fast and every thing. what happens if he dropped from a  B average to a C average? that's what i am talking about. you can just at least say you have 2 weeks to get up your grades and if you don't then to bad so sad. if you're school is having a big dodge ball tournament after school and you have teams you play with and you have a C average then its really boring for you and your dodge ball team is one man short and they cant play because of you.  all the student would want to change that other than the really smart students who have A averages, but that isn't the case here. its just wouldn't be fair to all the other student who liked sports in that school. so can we just see how it goes.  sincerely, STUDENT_NAME		0
 Driverless cars are a topic that has been discussed for many years, and the technology has been advancing rapidly. While some people believe that driverless cars will revolutionize transportation, others argue that they will lead to many negative consequences. In this essay, we will be discussing both the pros and cons of driverless cars and argue for the development of these cars.  Driverless cars can offer several benefits. Firstly, they can significantly reduce the number of accidents on the road. According to the article   Driverless Cars are Coming,   human error is the cause of more than 90% of all car accidents. With the help of advanced algorithms and sensors, driverless cars can detect hazards on the road and take corrective action to avoid them. This could potentially save thousands of lives every year.  Secondly, driverless cars can reduce traffic congestion and improve traffic flow. With the help of sensors and communication technology, driverless cars can communicate with each other and adapt to changing road conditions. This could lead to more efficient traffic flow, reducing congestion and shortening travel times.  Thirdly, driverless cars can offer greater mobility and independence to people who are unable to drive. This includes elderly people, children, and people with disabilities. With the help of driverless cars, these individuals could travel independently and with greater confidence.  Despite these benefits, there are also several potential negative consequences associated with driverless cars. Firstly, the development and implementation of driverless cars could be extremely expensive. According to the article, self-driving technology could cost up to $20,000 per car, which could be a significant barrier to adoption for many consumers.  Secondly, driverless cars could lead to job losses in the transportation industry. As the use of driverless cars becomes more widespread, there could be fewer opportunities for truck drivers, taxi drivers, and other transportation workers. This could have a significant impact on the economy and could lead to increased unemployment.  Finally, there are concerns about the security and reliability of driverless cars. There have been several high-profile incidents involving driverless cars, such as the Uber crash that led to the death of a pedestrian in Arizona in 2018. These incidents raise questions about the safety and reliability of the technology and could lead to a loss of public trust in driverless cars.  In conclusion, while there are certainly potential negative consequences associated with driverless cars, the benefits of this technology outweigh the risks. With further advances in technology and investment in infrastructure, driverless cars could revolutionize transportation and improve the lives of millions of people. While there may be job losses in certain industries, the benefits of greater safety, mobility, and efficiency will far outweigh the costs.		1
Driverless Cars, good or bad?  Yes, Yes driverless cars always sound like an awesome idea. Everyones dream, but have you thought of possible reprecussions? They say that the car will tell you when oncoming traffic or you are coming up on roadwork, but did they say anything in the article about kids running in front of the car, or even animals? What would stop the car from hitting this animal, or even a CHILD. I think kids are way more important than having a cool vehicle.  They did state that the driver should always have his/her eye on the road but, they were also talking about getting "in-car entertainment". I don't know if this sounds like television to you, but it sure does to me. And honestly, who's gonna watch the road if they're watching their favorite show?  They stated in the article that "we have to interpret driving fun in a new way". I don't think driving needs to be fun, you get where you are supposed to be and that's that. We do not need cars that'll drive for us. We are already beyond lazy, do they want us to be even lazier? Ameicans will do anything they can for an easy way out of doing something. Even if these cars will make loads of money, they aren't very safe.  The drivers seat is supposed to vibrate when backing out, if somethings in the way. Well what if the driver isn't fast enough to come to the wheel? What if they are too busy trying to pick what show they want to watch?  Let's talk about liability, Someone could easily get out of something because they can blame it on the manufacturer, "my seat didnt vibrate", "my shows didnt turn off", "the car didnt notify me". Do they really wanna get sued because someone lied?  Another thing, what the heck is up with "having cameras in the car". What even is privacy? Because, I'm quite sure thats an invasion of it. Out of everything I don't agree with, this is a huge one. They want to spy on people. Not ok.  Now if they come out with these cars and you get one, best of luck to you. but I gave you alot of reasons why the devolpment of these cars shouldn't happen. From the safety of our children, to our privacy. 		0
As an eighth-grade student, I believe that community service is an important aspect of life. It is a way for individuals to give back to their communities and make a positive impact on the world. However, there are arguments both for and against requiring students to do community service, and the potential impact on academic performance should also be considered.  On the one hand, community service can have numerous benefits. It can help students develop important skills such as communication, leadership, and problem-solving. It can also help students build relationships with their peers and improve their social skills. Additionally, community service can help students develop a sense of empathy and compassion for others, which can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful life.  On the other hand, there are valid concerns about the impact of community service on academic performance. Students may feel overwhelmed with the demands of school and community service, leading to decreased grades and increased stress. Additionally, community service may require students to give up valuable study time, which could negatively impact their academic performance.  To address these concerns, a potential solution would be to require students to complete a certain number of community service hours, but also provide them with flexibility in how they complete those hours. For example, students could choose to complete their community service hours in a way that fits their schedule and interests, such as volunteering at a local animal shelter or participating in a community garden.  Additionally, schools could provide resources to help students manage their time effectively and balance their academic and community service responsibilities. This could include tutoring, study groups, and mentorship programs.  In conclusion, community service is an important aspect of life that can have numerous benefits for students. However, it is important to consider the potential impact on academic performance and take steps to address these concerns. By providing flexibility and resources, schools can ensure that students are able to complete community service hours in a way that is beneficial for both the students and the community.		1
 Introduction:  As a student, I have always been fascinated by unique and adventurous experiences, and the Seagoing Cowboys program has caught my eye. This program allows young people between the ages of 16-24 to ride the waves, work hard, and experience a different way of life. After reading about the incredible opportunities that the Seagoing Cowboys provide, I am convinced that you too should consider joining this program.  Body:  Firstly, the Seagoing Cowboys program presents an opportunity to challenge oneself and step out of one's comfort zone. As a student, we are conditioned to think that certain experiences are only available to those who have completed their education, earned a stable job, and accumulated wealth. However, the Seagoing Cowboys program flips this narrative on its head, allowing young people to experience exciting adventures while they are still in school. By participating in this program, you will not only challenge yourself, but you will also broaden your horizons and learn new skills that will benefit you throughout your life.  In the article, "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves," Luke shares his experience riding the waves on the USS Coast Guard, a ship that operates in extreme conditions. One of the most unique parts of his job was serving as a helicopter rescue swimmer, which allowed him to rescue people from the sea. This experience not only provided Luke with a thrilling adventure, but it also taught him valuable skills that he will use in his future career.  Secondly, the Seagoing Cowboys program provides an opportunity to work hard in unique and challenging environments. By participating in this program, Luke had to work long hours and tough conditions while performing physically and mentally demanding tasks. This experience helped him develop discipline, perseverance, and a strong work ethic, which are all qualities that will benefit him in the future.  Furthermore, the Seagoing Cowboys program provides an opportunity to make a difference in the world. The Coast Guard is responsible for carrying out many important missions, including search and rescue operations, disaster relief missions, and maritime law enforcement. By participating in this program, Luke was able to make a real difference in people's lives and contribute towards the greater good of society.  Lastly, the Seagoing Cowboys program provides an opportunity to visit many unique and exotic places. As Luke shares in the article, he was able to visit some of the most breathtaking and remote places on Earth, including Antarctica, the Arabian Gulf, and the South Pacific. By participating in this program, you too will have the opportunity to explore new cultures, meet new people, and experience the world from a completely different perspective.  Conclusion:  In conclusion, the Seagoing Cowboys program presents an incredible opportunity for young people to challenge themselves, broaden their horizons, develop valuable skills, make a difference in the world, and visit many unique and exotic places. I encourage anyone who is looking for a thrilling and unforgettable experience to consider joining this program. The experiences that Luke had on board the USS Coast Guard are just the tip of the iceberg, and you too can ride the waves and make your own adventure.		1
Summer is a great time of year for both teachers and students. Months of break and leisure allow for a good cool down¬†after a long school year. However, summer isn't all fun and games, as many schools give out summer assignments in order to keep the students learning over break. But should the responsibility of designing these projects fall on the student or the teacher? I believe that teachers should create and design these projects, as students could make the assignment too easy or too hard, warp the directions to a point where the final product is no longer what the teacher is looking for, or just not complete it.  My first reason justifying¬†my belief is that students could make the assignment too easy or too hard. If given the choice between taking on a difficult assignment and an easy one, most students would choose the easy one. In this same way, if students are given the opportunity to make their own assignment, then they will do everything in their power to make sure it's as simple and easy as possible. This results in them not actually learning anything and defeats the whole purpose of the assignment in the first place. On the other side of the spectrum, there could be students who try to take on too much with their project, setting lofty goals and overcomplicating¬†the assignment. This only serves to build stress the student over break as then they feel as if their project is too much to complete and only do a minimal amount of work on it, if any at all. If a teacher were to give set directions, then this wouldn't happen as there would be a very minimal amount of freedom, resulting in projects being neither too easy or too difficult.  Furthermore, if a student is given the reigns on the creation of an assignment, they could warp the directions, intentionally or accidentally, and the project could end up becoming something the teacher isnt looking for. This could happen for many reasons, ranging from students with malcontent¬†looking to make it easier for themselves or students who just understood the directions differently than the teacher explained them, resulting in a project that doesn't teach the student what they need to learn. If this occurs, the student would not realize their mistake until they go back to school in the fall and turn in their assignment for a grade, leaving them with a bad grade to start off the year and no chance for remediation.  However, the opportunity to create and design the assignment could help students find motivation and may even affect the quality of the work. It's no secret that people do better work when they are invested in the topic or field, and often times go out of their way to avoid topics they hate. Because of this, if students are given the freedom to create their own project, they are more likely to center it around something they are passionate about, leading them to be more likely to not only complete the assignment over break but actually put effort into it.  Contrary to the previous point, students, if left to their own devices, could end up just not doing the assignment. This could happen because the vague guidelines given by the teacher to design an an assignment could be unclear and seem overwhelming to even begin. Non-creative students could also not to start the project as they can't think of a place to start, leaving them to be more likely to not try. Even if the student does get over the initial barrier of creating an assignment, they could get bored wit their topic and change it several times, resulting lack of motivation to actually finish or a final product that is half baked or an amalgamation of several ideas.  In conclusion, summer projects need to be created and designed by teachers in order to prevent students from making and assignment too easy or too hard, warping the directions, or not doing the assignment at all. All of these only result in the students getting nothing out of their summer assignments, leaving precious break time wasted.		0
Technology does not determine your mood. Technology are used to search of dectect information. It is used to help others to learn about something. You can't calculate how people really feel. You'll never know how people feel unless they tell you theirselves.  Technology does not tell how people feel because the results of people's feelings may not be accurate. It does not detects how really happened. Also, it don't express people's personal issues. Just because people smile, don't mean they're really happy. Some people may frown. But that does not mean if they are really upset.  You never know how people feel because they do that just to make it seem like everything is okay. But things they people go throught is not alright. Technology does not tell the actually truth when it comes to personal problems. Also, it will not express what people have going on in their life. The results when technology will not be a hundred percent true about human emotions.  Technology are not always accurate about people. Dectecting people's emotions may by looking at facial expressions by technology will not work out. Technology is for research, networks, tools,power points, and also microsoft word. Technology on my opinion don't determine people's mood. But technology can show things that you don't know about.  Finally, Technology does not determine people's emotions. Technology is for research about thing or people that you don't know about. It can't show you the truth about people's emotions. Sadly, it will not express how people really feel about something or someone. Therefore, people theirselves can only tell you what their emotions really are when they frown or smile.		0
Title: The Importance of Challenging Yourself and Pursuing Your Dreams  Introduction:  In his famous quote, Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail." This statement highlights the importance of stepping out of your comfort zone and pursuing your dreams, no matter how impossible they may seem. In this essay, I will discuss the process of achieving your goals, the importance of trying new things, and how people may limit themselves by not challenging themselves.  Step 1: Researching Your Dreams  The first step in achieving your dreams is to research and understand what it takes to get there. This may involve reading books, talking to people who have already accomplished what you want to achieve, or even taking classes or workshops to gain the necessary skills. By gathering information and knowledge, you will be better equipped to make informed decisions and take action towards your goals.  Step 2: Brainstorming Ideas  Once you have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve, the next step is to brainstorm ideas on how to get there. This may involve breaking down your goals into smaller, more manageable steps, or creating a timeline of when you want to achieve each step. By having a clear plan in place, you will be able to stay focused and motivated as you work towards your goals.  Step 3: Outlining the Process  With your ideas in mind, the next step is to outline the process of how you will achieve your goals. This may involve creating a list of the resources you will need, such as time, money, and support from others. It may also involve identifying potential obstacles and developing strategies to overcome them. By having a clear plan in place, you will be better prepared to take action and make progress towards your goals.  Step 4: The Importance of Hard Work  While it's true that nothing is impossible, it's also true that hard work is necessary to achieve your goals. Success is not simply handed to you; it requires dedication, perseverance, and a willingness to put in the time and effort to make your dreams a reality. By working hard and never giving up, you will be able to overcome any obstacles that may arise and achieve the success you desire.  Step 5:		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I strongly believe that you should not change school polices. You should not change school polices because most students have a 'c' average in many classes. Three main reasons why you shouldn't change school polices are that many students love playing sports and that might be the one thing they do to waste time. Another reason i will give you is that if you change the school policy ,instead of kids doing good things they will do bad things. My last and final reason is that students with out sports, because they have a 'c', would really be sad because all teenage boys cant live without sports.  If you change school policies students will not have something to waste time in. They are not going to be cleaning the rooms, the kitchen, the stove, they are not going to be gardening.  teenage boys live to play sports. It doesn't matter the sport they will still be playing something.  Another reason I listed above is if students are not playing a sport what are they going to be doing? For all we know they can be out in the real world doing drugs. Maybe you will see them on the news "have you seen this student? He has killed a young girl"  My last an final reason is that a student with out sports that would be sad. I mean it's like taking a little girl's doll. i'm really what teenager dose not play sports?  So tohse were my reasons why		0
The sun is blazing, what a great day to go to the pool. That isn't an option because instead high school students need to make sure they meet check points for their summer break project. Assignments that are given to over summer break should be student designed. If projects are student designed they can work it around their schedule better, play to their learning style, and be motivated.  Over the summer everyone has some sort of plan. Whether its family vacation, a job, or studying for the SAT, there is always one hectic part during summer break. With projects in the mix too it can get chaotic juggling it all. If students are allowed to create their own schedule and check points to better work around their summer, the more likely it is for the assignment to be finished. This summer I went to Africa for a month to a remote village to help build a school. For the entire month I could not have any connection to anything, since service was 4 hours away. The reason why I didn't sign up for AP's was because I would not have been able to turn in my work by those checkpoints. If I had been able to have the single requirement of having it all done before school started I would be in AP classes right now. While some assignments may be created by teachers to make sure their students actually get their work done, it can end up hurting more than helping. If students are allowed design their own checkpoints for summer assignments the results would turn out better.  Every student learns differently. Whether they are a kinetic or aural learner there is no way to tailor an education style to target everyone. If students were given a broad topic such as do research on the Peruvian rebellions during the 1970's, it gives students the freedom to tailor to their own needs. They would be learning the same topic, just taking different routes to get there. In marching band we were given a similar concept. When learning and teaching people how to march it can be difficult to get this learn this new technique of walking. We walk everyday, so to break this habit can be difficult. Some rookies need to be taught by telling what they need to do, while others would prefer that they learn how to do it by watching an example. Everyone learns in a different way, and if students are able to design their own way of learning, it can lead to better understanding their summer assignment.  No history teacher gets excited reading an essay that their student was very obviously not devoted to. The same applies to students. Students do not want to spend their one big break from school studying a topic they aren't motivated in. When students are forced to do something motivation goes out the window. The final result is not pleasureable for a kid to do, and not something a teacher will want to grade and give feedback on. An example I've often heard is that whenever students are assigned a book that they must read, it can make the experience of not as enjoyable. This happened to me my freshman year. We were reading  To Kill a Mocking Bird . I purposefully had waited to read it because I wanted it to give my own, fresh analysis when we discussed in class. When the first quiz came I was excited to write down the points that I had come up with. The actual test questions were all based on small details that would have to be memorized in order to get the correct answers. I was so terrified that I wasn't going to do well on the quizzes that instead of reading and enjoying myself, I was stuck trying to memorize information so I wouldn't fail that quarter. I didn't enjoy reading anymore and by the end of the unit I had stopped reading the book entirely. There was nothing I was gaining from memorizing lines, and I had no motivation to do that. If students are allowed to design their own over the summer projects they can tailor it to what they most enjoy. I'm sure there are some that like to see where the author wants the book to be taken, while others prefer to read a book and see what they grasp from it. The more students are able to enjoy their work the more motivated they will be to learn.  Some may say that it is better that the summer assignments are teacher designed, that way it is confirmed that everyone learns the information they need to by the time they need to do it. This teaches nothing to students. Later on in life they will not have a textbook to read on how to solve their problems, they will need to be creative and navigate their way through on their own. This can apply to personal issues or in the work place too. Students need to start learning more about themselves and how they work. There is no better time to learn then when they have adults that can help them when they need  Time management, motivation, and learning styles are all things students need to learn about themselves. For over the summer assignments students should be allowed to design their own projects so that it works best for them. These are all skills they will need to learn eventually, so why not let them start figuring it out now?		0
 Car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular, and for good reason. As transportation continues to be a major contributor to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, many cities are turning to alternative modes of travel to reduce their environmental impact. In addition, car-free cities can also provide a number of other benefits, such as improved public health, increased community engagement, and enhanced economic opportunities.  One of the main advantages of car-free cities is the reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major source of transportation-related pollution, which can have devastating effects on human health and the environment. By eliminating cars from the road, car-free cities can significantly reduce their emissions, making them healthier and more sustainable for everyone.  Another benefit of car-free cities is the improved public health. When cars are not on the road, air quality improves, and people are less likely to experience respiratory problems. In addition, car-free cities encourage people to engage in physical activity by walking, cycling, or using public transportation. This can lead to a healthier population, with lower rates of obesity, heart disease, and other health issues.  Car-free cities can also provide a number of economic opportunities. For example, implementing a car-free policy can create new jobs in the transportation and related industries, such as bike shops, public transportation providers, and electric vehicle charging stations. In addition, car-free cities can attract new businesses and tourists, who are looking for unique and sustainable destinations.  Finally, car-free cities can provide a greater sense of community engagement. By requiring people to rely on alternative modes of transportation, car-free cities encourage them to interact with their neighbors and engage in social activities. This can lead to a stronger sense of community and social cohesion.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a number of benefits, including improved air quality, public health, economic opportunities, and community engagement. As more and more cities turn to alternative modes of transportation, it's likely that we will see even more benefits in the future. So let's embrace car-free cities and the positive changes they bring!		1
 The electoral college is a group of people who are responsible for electing the president of the United States. While the electoral college has been in place since the founding of the country, its effectiveness has been called into question in recent years. This essay will explore the pros and cons of the electoral college and argue that it is ultimately an effective system for electing the president.  One of the main arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it ensures that the president of the United States is elected by the entire country, not just a small number of people living in densely populated regions. This means that the president will be elected by people from all walks of life, not just urban liberals or rural conservatives. This diversification ensures that the president will be elected with the best interests of the entire country in mind, rather than just a small subset of America.  Another benefit of the electoral college is that it provides a system of checks and balances in the election process. When political parties and interest groups are trying to win over voters, they often focus on specific geographic regions or demographics. This can lead to a situation in which certain regions or groups of people are being ignored or marginalized by the election process. However, the electoral college requires that both parties have support from a wide range of states, not just from a few key battleground states. This ensures that the candidate with broad appeal will be elected, rather than just a candidate who can appeal to specific groups of voters.  Despite its many advantages, the electoral college is not without its flaws. One of the main criticisms of the system is that it disproportionately favors certain states over others. For example, states with larger populations will have more electoral votes than states with smaller populations, even if the percentage of the population that votes for each candidate is the same. This means that certain states will have more sway in the election process than they should, and other states will be largely ignored.  The electoral college also has a tendency to create a situation in which the winner of the popular vote does not win the election. This is because the president is elected by the electoral college, not by the popular vote, which means that a candidate can still win the election even if they lose the popular vote. This has been seen in several elections in recent years, including the 2000 and 2016 elections.  In conclusion, the electoral college is an effective system for electing the president of the United States. Despite its flaws, it ensures that the president is elected by the entire country, not just a small number of people living in densely populated areas. It also provides a system of checks and balances in the election process, ensuring that the candidate with broad appeal will be elected. While there may be ways to improve the electoral college in the future, it remains an effective and important system that should be closely watched and carefully considered.		1
Almost every American has a car. Just go outside and look at your neighborhood.. I'm almost positive if you were to look everyone would have a car except for maybe 1 or 2.. The car is in our everyday use basically.. It helps us get to work, run aarons, take kids to school, etc. Now you may seem like theres only 1 risk of being in a car, but believe it or not.. When your car is on and running you're hurting the air.. Now I know the air doesn't have feelings! But logically you're hurting the air and yourself. America should limit car usage for simple reasons like air pollution, car accidents, and laziness. These are the things we should focus on when we're in our cars or when we talk about safety because all those reasons fall into that category. Small changes would be nice and helpful here. It reduce lot of problems we have, and stress.  To kick this off, limiting the usage of cars would reduce the amount of air pollution that we are surrounded in now. Think about it millions of cars on and running everyday, sometimes if you look closely thers black gas coming out of the exhaust pipe.. And you're breating that? Out of millions of cars where do you think all those fumes go? they don't just dissapear! We're breating it! sure you might say "So if im breathing it doesn't that mean i should be dead?!" no.. that's not the case.. Yes it's bad for you but it hurts the earth mostly the gases break apart the atmosphere we have around to block other fumes from other places out. Think of the earth as a hamster in a ball.. The hamster is the earth and the ball is out atmosphere. The holes in the ball are the holes made from the gases that are released from our cars. This could let any type if gas in. In places like China there's a huge problem caused by all the cars.. it's called smog. Think of fog all over the place but its black and smells really bad. Not only that but it's really bad for you. You may think why don't we have that here? Well China is the most populated country in the world and almost everyone has a car. China is a pretty busy place you'd imagine because of all the people. Well you're right.. All the fumes coming out of those cars cause all that smog to contaminate everything there. Like water, animals, food, and even you! It's very bad. China needs to limit the usage of their cars in order to stop problems like that because it can effect everything around them. We should start worrying about the smog aswell because America is a pretty big place and all the busy cars can cause something similar to a smog, it may not be as big bu it will still cause damage. With all this said hopefully you understand what air pollution does and how we can reduce it.  Moving along, Car accidents is a very big thing everywhere it causes thousands of deaths and injuries. We can stop all of it if we can limit the car usuage. you may say "We can also just stop teens from driving.." well yeah you can do that but how will they learn for themselves? Small rules metioned in the article are very interesting like cars with even licence plates were allowed to drive on mondays for example, and cars who drove with odd licence plates were fined for not obeying the law. On Tuesdays it would be the same but for odd licence plates. I think if this rules was implemented atleast 2 times a week it would help reduce the amount of accidents. There wouldn't be asmuch cars and it will be lot safer for people to drive. Sadly in lot of accidents they are fatal in highways, just imagine hundrends of thousands of cars driving in 34 lanes, you hit a car and it will obivously start a big problem from there. Think of it like dominos stacked in a line you knock one down and it just starts all tumbling in order. Yeah some cars avoid it but not always. The less the cars the less the accidents. Altough this is off topic but limiting the amount of cars on a freeway or highway per hour will limit the amount of accidents aswell. Back to the point, America needs to do something about the cars or it will just keep happening the more the drivers the more the danger out in the roads and highways. Hopefully this helped you understand more about the limiting of car use a little more.  We're almost there, how ever we should stop revolving our selves around our car. If you live 10 minutes away from a supermarket or small convienience store just walk there.. You're just wasting money and polluting the air driving there.. A bike is a great way to get there you go decently fast, you don't get tired as much and it's a good exercise. We should stop getting to lazy because it is affecting both us and the earth very negatively. I would understand if you're in a hurry but seriously.. If you're 1020 minutes walking distance why not just walk there.. You don't only exercise in the gym, get some fresh air outside.. well partially fresh air.. Yeah you get the point.. We need to get our butts up and walk places because our car isn't our only source of transportation! It's not just hurting you! Don't forget your purse or wallet! Because it has a big impact on that to with the gas prices going all over the place right now. Something people don't see when they're driving there car is what there doing to the enviornment, yeah i've mentioned it many times but it something we really need to look at because it effects your health tremendously. If you actually take the time to walk or bike to where ever you want it feels nice to actually walk and stretch your muscles out. We need more car reduced communities so that we don't just use our cars all day to get to places not to far away.  To conclude, we need to start limiting the usage of cars in order to reduce lot of problems in our enviornment. Most of our enviornmental problems revolve around something we use everyday which is the car. Problems such as air pollution, car accidents, and laziness. These things just don't effect you, if effects everyone including the envornment. This is something we should look out for ecause it is a very negative thing we have. Mainly air pollution because that affects everything.. And i mean everthing... Food, water, animals, plants, and even you.. So we all should look out for this and be a bt more responsible. We need more laws to help reduce the amount of smog and greenhouse gases that we have here today in our world. Hopefully you read this and learned lot about the importance of limiting the usage of cars and how it can effect everything.		0
School Extracurricular Activity  I agree, all students should do Extracurricular Activity in school and outside of school. I feel like it will help them out with a lot of stuff like stress and can help them find out who they really are. It can give them time to be with friends and can also give them the chance to met new people. And it can bring the teachers and students closer to each other. This would give them the chance to get to know each other and try new things out.  Extracurricular Activity's would be so helpful to the school's community. This program can also help kids not be on their phones as much. it would help kids come all together and work as a team. I feel like now in days kids dont really care about there Schools Extracurricular Activity's. I feel like a lot of kids\teens depend on this phones for answers, ideas, and etc. these ideas will show them that there are better stuff then just being on your Phone, iPad, and Computer.  These school activity's will probably also bring students and teachers closer. Student's most of the time dont like school so these Activity's¬†can show them that school can be fun. These activity's¬†will give kids a chance to see the bright side of school and also the true meaning. It will also teach kids that trying new things out with new people can be fun. These programs can really make a kids or teens life a huge impact.  Extracurricular Activity's can show kids how to be more outgoing and bring the shy kids out of the shy zone. These Activity's can teach kids so many life lessons. It help kids and teens who think they are lazy turn into great students. These Activity's can inspire students to do better in school and lift there grades up. It can help kids/teens find out what they truly love and what they truly dislike.  I hope my words help out community's¬†who are thinking about putting Extracurricular Activity's in there School system. I truly agree with these activity's and think it will help a lot with kids/teens. I hope one day all schools have fun activities for there students. I think can help many students come out into the real life and show them the true meaning of life. I love this idea so much and wish the best of luck for community with these activities.

I had a very amazing time being a Seagoing Cowboy, and this is why I think you should become a Seagoing Cowboy also. This is one of the best opportunitys you could possibly have. If you love being around aniamls or helping people this would be something perfect for you. Another reason you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is you get to see so many cool places. During my time of being a Seagoing Cowboy I saw Europe, China, Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, and a excavated castle in Crete.  One of my favorite parts of being a Seagoing Cowboy was after we unloaded the animals. This is because we had the whole ship to ourselves, sometimes we even played games or sports in the area we kept the animals. The things we did were baseball, volleyball, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other ganes. If you love to do things like this then you would enjoy being a Seagoing Cowboy.  In conclusion you should really think about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. All of the reasons that were listed above are great things, and if you enjoy those things then you will enjoy being a Seagoing Cowboy. Also this is a really great way to help out for the people in need. So I truley recomend you becoming a Seagoing Cowboy!		0
Using this techlonogy of Facial Action Coding System would be very useful and valuable to be used in a classroom.  There's are several of reasons why It's a good idea to use this genuis technique in class.  To start off It's pretty incrible that a computer can see what emotion you are feeling. Why not use it? It'll come in pretty handy. Let's just say that a student In the class is never doing their work. They're constantly distracted and they don't show any effort. The computer can tell us what emotion the student is feeling so then that way It'll not only be helpful for the teacher to know what's going on but it'll also be helpful to the student so that the teacher helps the student not to struggle so much.  It can also help with students that are confused and aren't sure how they are feeling or mayeb they feel a lot of things at once which is very confusing a computer than can show what your feeling is a good tool. It can help you firgure out what your feeling In cas you don't know how you feel.  Same with teachers. Students can firgure out what their teacher is feeling that way they can avoid getting into trouble. If they see a teachers angry they wouldn't wanna make them more mad.  As in for students. With this cool technology it can help students find out what's going on in case they have a friend who they're worried about and they're not so sure what's going on with their friend. Well this computer can quickly help you figure out what's going on with them. Im sure your friend would really appriciate that you help them out even if it seems like they don't.  These are the reasons I think that using this computer that show what emotions you've got is simply very helpful to both students and teachers. It's a smart way in not only showing how you feel but also producing them. 		0
**The Challenge of Exploring Venus**  Venus, the second planet from the sun, is an inhospitable world with a surface temperature of 864 degrees Fahrenheit and a crushing atmospheric pressure 92 times that of Earth. Despite these dangers, some scientists believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. In his article ‚ÄúThe Challenge of Exploring Venus, ?David Grinspoon argues that Venus is a fascinating planet with a rich history, and that studying it could help us better understand our own solar system and the evolution of life.   Grinspoon begins by discussing the planet‚Äôs extreme environment. He notes that Venus‚Äôs atmosphere is composed primarily of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid droplets. The surface is hot enough to melt lead, and the pressure is so great that it would crush a human being into a thin film. However, Grinspoon argues that Venus‚Äôs harsh environment is also what makes it so interesting. He writes that ‚ÄúVenus is a natural experiment in extreme planetary evolution, one that we can‚Äôt replicate in a lab. ?Studying Venus could help us better understand how planets form and evolve, and what conditions are necessary for life to exist.  Grinspoon also argues that Venus may have once been a much more hospitable planet. He notes that Venus‚Äôs atmosphere is rich in carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas that traps heat. This suggests that Venus may have once had a much warmer climate, and that it may even have had liquid water on its surface. If so, then Venus could have been a potential home for life. Studying Venus could help us determine whether or not it ever hosted life, and what happened to that life if it did exist.  Finally, Grinspoon argues that studying Venus could help us better understand Earth. He notes that Venus and Earth are very similar planets in many ways. Both planets are about the same size, and they both have atmospheres composed primarily of carbon dioxide. However, Earth is a much more hospitable planet than Venus. This suggests that there are some key differences between the two planets that led to Earth‚Äôs becoming a planet capable of supporting life. Studying Venus could help us identify these differences, and learn more about what makes Earth so special.  In conclusion, Grinspoon makes a compelling case that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Venus is a fascinating planet with a rich history, and it could hold important clues about the evolution of life. Studying Venus could help us better understand our own solar system and the place of Earth in it.  **Evaluation**  Grinspoon does a good job of supporting his argument that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. He presents a strong case for the planet‚Äôs scientific importance, and he argues persuasively that Venus could hold important clues about the evolution of life. However, Grinspoon‚Äôs argument is not without its flaws.  One minor logical inconsistency in Grinspoon‚Äôs argument is that he suggests that Venus may have once been a much more hospitable planet, but then he goes on to say that it is unlikely that life ever existed on Venus. If Venus was once a more hospitable planet, then it is at least possible that life could have evolved there. However, Grinspoon does not provide any evidence to support his claim that life is unlikely to have ever existed on Venus.  Overall, Grinspoon does a good job of supporting his argument that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. He presents a strong case for the planet‚Äôs scientific importance, and he argues persuasively that Venus could hold important clues about the evolution of life. However, Grinspoon‚Äôs argument is not without its flaws. Specifically, he does not provide any evidence to support his claim that life is unlikely to have ever existed on Venus.		1
 Venus, also known as the Earth's sister planet, is the second planet from the sun and is similar in size and composition to Earth. However, despite its proximity to Earth, much about Venus remain unknown, and exploration of this mysterious planet is still in its early stages.   Venus has a dense, toxic atmosphere that traps heat, making the planet uninhabitable to humans and most other life forms. The surface of Venus is rocky and barren, with deep volcanic trenches and towering mountains that reach up to 90% of the planet's diameter.   Despite these harsh conditions, scientists have found evidence of water on Venus. Recent studies suggest that water may exist in the form of ice or methane gas in the planet's atmosphere and on its surface. This discovery opens up the possibility of finding evidence of past or even present microbial life on Venus.   Exploring Venus would require advanced technology and equipment, including unmanned rovers and space probes. These devices would need to be built to withstand the extreme temperatures and conditions on the planet. Scientists would also need to develop new ways to detect and analyze possible signs of life, such as ancient microbial fossils or biosignatures.   In addition to scientific exploration, understanding and learning from Venus can also benefit humanity in many ways. Venus' dense atmosphere and extreme conditions provide a unique laboratory to study the formation and evolution of our own planet. Furthermore, studying Venus may help us understand the potential for life beyond Earth, and how to search for it in the future.   In conclusion, exploring Venus is a complex and challenging task that requires advanced technology and scientific knowledge. However, the potential rewards of discovering evidence of life on this sister planet are immense, and could have a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and our place in it.

Should Cellphones Be Used While Driving?  Ordinary people die in auto collisions from use of mobile phones while driving quite often. As indicated by research, mobile phones are driving variables that reason mishaps. Regardless of the circumstance, individuals still use phones since they feel that they need to be constantly accessible and stay in contact with other individuals. Likewise, individuals without their cell phone feel sheltered because they can drive utilizing two hands. Also, they use contentions that cellphones are fundamental in crisis circumstances. Although a few people defend utilizing mobile phones while driving, there are confirmations that they're risky and individuals ought to abstain from talking on phones while driving.  People whose work relies upon a mobile phone like attorneys or agents state that they generally must be accessible to pick up the phone to keep their business running. Be that as it may, due to their propensities, they can make perilous and unsafe circumstances like a crash or a mishap. Business issues can be distressing and perilous while driving since it can cause passionate responses that can prompt disaster. Due to the discussion, they may get steamed and this can bring down their driving capacity which can prompt them to lose authority over the vehicle. So if individuals don't settle on a choice to secure their mobile phones, their routine can hurt honest individuals.  In any case, headphones don't dispose of the danger of causing a mishap. Several people demonstrate that utilizing headphones can be as perilous as holding a telephone on the grounds that the discussions diverts drivers from concentrating out and about. Researchers had demonstrated that individuals talking via telephone picture the person who they're conversing with and that doesn't meddle with driving. The issue is the point at which a vehicle swerves surprisingly or walker venture into traffic, and the mind does not have the preparing capacity to respond in time. So the issue isn't in holding the haggle telephone in the meantime what may cause a mishap on account of a needed maneuver, it is a result of discussion and absence of response at the critical moment.  Adversaries state that PDAs are great since they have a chance to make a comeback if there should arise an occurrence of crisis. Be that as it may, it is a fantasy of wellbeing since when individuals need it the most it is possible that they can't discover it or achieve it since they are stuck in vehicle. Individuals shouldn't completely rely upon PDAs since they are not solid, and the trusty answer for the troublesome circumstance is OnStar. OnStar is an administration that in the event of mishap or a crisis will get in touch with you. On the off chance that you are not ready to reply, they will contact police office, emergency clinic and flame administration giving them your precise GPS area. In this manner, these days PDAs are pointless gadgets since they are problematic in crisis circumstances while On Star is dependable and ready to help you in an accident.  Finishing up, if individuals don't surrender mobile phones the quantity of fatalities on the streets will. It is individuals obligation to not cause their own and others individuals lives.         		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  To me community service is important and all students that attend SCHOOL_NAME should be required to participate in community service. Community service is very important. I believe responsibility for serving these hours should begin in sixth grade with a requirement of about ten hours. Then the hours per student should increase as the grade the student is in increases. If students are required to achieve service hours it will do a lot of good for them and for their community.  A positive consequence for the students at SCHOOL_NAME would be preparing them for high school. At most Catholic high schools community service is definitely a big part of a student's education. At SCHOOL_NAME or SCHOOL_NAME, service hours are required in a large quantity. This is one reason why I think community service would help the students of SCHOOL_NAME  Another reason is to teach kids at young a age the great part about helping people. Sure you could just tell them it is good to help somebody but telling them won't put them in a habit of helping. If the students go out and help others on a pretty regular basis then it will become a habit of helping others and they will do something to help more people in their community without having to think twice about it.  Community service would also be a great advantage for SCHOOL_NAME and attract more people to this school. People who see students from SCHOOL_NAME helping in their community will want to send their child here. Most parents would like to send their child to a school with community service to teach him or her morals and discipline. It would be excellent for SCHOOL_NAME to adopt this idea of community service.  In conclusion, I believe community service would do tons of good for the students, SCHOOL_NAME and the whole community. Not only would this go to the student's advantage and would give everyone, including SCHOOL_NAME, an edge. TEACHER_NAME, if you propose and adopt this idea, I guarantee you will not regret it.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
I believe that students would benefit greatly from being able to attend classes from home through distance learning. There are several reasons why I believe this to be true.  First, distance learning would provide students with more flexibility in terms of when and where they can attend classes. This would allow students to work around their own schedules, whether that means taking care of family responsibilities or pursuing extracurricular activities. For example, if a student is a talented athlete and needs to attend regular practices and games, distance learning could enable them to attend class on their own schedule so they don't miss out on any educational opportunities.  Second, distance learning would help students develop important skills, such as self-discipline and time management. Since students would be responsible for attending class on their own schedule, they would need to be more self-motivated and disciplined in order to keep up with their coursework. This would help students develop important life skills that will be valuable in their future academic and professional pursuits.  Finally, distance learning would be particularly beneficial for students who may struggle in traditional classroom settings. For example, students with anxiety or other mental health issues may find it easier to participate in class from the comfort of their own home. Additionally, students who may be more introverted or shy may feel more comfortable participating in online discussions rather than in-person conversations.  In conclusion, I believe that distance learning would have numerous benefits for students, including increased flexibility, the development of important life skills, and support for students who may struggle in traditional classroom settings. Overall, I think that schools should consider offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home.		1
  Limiting car usage has numerous advantages, and it's time for citizens to take notice. The benefits of reducing car dependency go beyond reducing emissions and improving air quality. By exploring the ideas presented in the given passage set, we can see that limiting car usage can lead to a healthier, more efficient, and more livable community.  Firstly, reducing car usage can significantly improve air quality. The passage from "Car-Free Cities" highlights how the city of Freiburg in Germany has achieved significant reductions in emissions by promoting alternative transportation methods, such as cycling and walking. Similarly, the passage from "Paris bans driving due to smog" notes that the city's efforts to reduce car usage have led to a significant improvement in air quality. By limiting car usage, cities can reduce the amount of harmful emissions released into the atmosphere, improving the health and well-being of their citizens.  Secondly, limiting car usage can lead to a more efficient and livable community. The passage from "The End of Car Culture" notes that the trend towards reducing car ownership is likely to continue, with millennials showing a decreased interest in owning cars. This shift towards alternative transportation methods can lead to a more compact and walkable community, with businesses and services located near residential areas. As observed in the passage from "Car-Free Day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota," this can lead to the creation of parks and sports centers, as well as the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. By promoting alternative transportation methods, cities can create a more livable and efficient community.  Some may argue that limiting car usage will lead to a loss of convenience and freedom. However, the passage from "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" highlights how the lack of car		1
Seeking multiple opinions when making an important decision or asking for advice is usually a wise choice. By talking to more than one person about a decision, you are able to gain different perspectives that can provide valuable insights. Each person you ask is likely to have their own experiences, knowledge, and point of view that contributes to a more well-rounded understanding of your options and their potential consequences.   No single person has all of the answers or can foresee every outcome of a particular choice. Getting input from multiple sources helps account for individual biases or gaps in knowledge. It's unlikely that two people would think of things or view a situation in exactly the same way. Bringing together the assessments of various individuals helps present a fuller picture. You gain a better sense of the pros and cons, practical considerations, and unanticipated effects that you may not have thought of on your own.  Different people also have expertise in various areas that can shed light on different aspects of your decision. For example, if considering a career path, talking to people working in roles you're interested in as well as those knowledgeable about the field or industry more broadly would give you a richer set of perspectives. You might learn valuable practical tips, discover which responsibilities match your strengths best, or find alternatives you hadn't known to explore.   In addition, comparing and contrasting the advice from multiple sources allows you to assess which viewpoints seem most logical, realistic, and aligned with your own priorities, values and circumstances. Taking into account advice tailored specifically to you and your situation leads to a decision that is more carefully deliberated and personally suited. Weighing the collective wisdom of several trusted individuals helps reduce the chances of making a choice you may later regret based on a single opinion. In the end, seeking multiple viewpoints improves your decision making abilities and ability to choose an option you feel confident about.		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  There are many reasons one might support these two very different policies, but it is clear that one must be chose. I was thinking that if you had an opinion from a student's point of view, it might help you make a decision.  I for one think that students do not need to have phones in schools at all. If they need a phone during the school day, they can ask a teacher or go to the office. They do not need to have a phone with them all the time and if they are allowed to do so, they may become dependent on it and be more tempted to use it in class.  Students are already not allowed to have phones with them in class, yet they still keep them in their pockets, and often times use them. If they are actually allowed to have their phones with them, it is more likely that they will break the rules.  I'm sure many students would not like the idea of not having their phones with them all the time and would absolutely love that they would be able to use them at lunch and free periods, but I still think it is completely unnecessary. There is no need to have your phones with you when you can simply ask to use the teacher's or the office phone. If students were allowed to use their phones during school, it would only be a distraction to their learning, and therefore a nuisance in the building.  The main purpose in school is to learn and prepare students for adult life, but if students are more interested in socializing, it could create large consequences in the future.  Phones can be very beneficial in some circumstances, but school is not one of them. In school, students would be more likely to cheat with their phones, making it easier to get answers from other students.  Though the majority of the students that attend our school would strongly support Policy 1, they most likely are supporting it for all of the wrong reasons. Policy 2 is clearly the right choice to make. There is absolutely no reason what so ever why students can not go eight hours with out sending a text to a friend when they can simply tell them in person. As said before, there is also no reason why a student could not make a phone call using the office or a teacher's phone.  All I ask is that you take my reasons for enforcing Policy 2 into consideration and make the right choice for our school.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
As we all know cars are a big part of our society today. However cars have a bigger impact than we think. Some people can't live without there car. Some people can go their whole life without a car. We may not think about it however there are multiple advantages to not using a car. When we limit our car use it saves the earth also it i said that it takes away a heap load of stress and it saves people money. Just think about it, one day without the use of cars. How would that be?  We we think of saving the earth we think of recycling, reusing things, and reducing. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.(According to "In German Surburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" By: Elisabeth Rosenthal). In Paris there pollution was almost record setting and so they ordered that even-numbered license plates leave their cars at home or pay a fine of $31. Almost 4000 drivers were fined that day¬† and 27 got their cars impounded. Most of the cars in Paris are diesel ran so the smog is worse. If they would cut down on their car use it would lower the smog.  You might not think of it but if we limited the use of cars it relieves stress. According to "In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars", In Vauban, Germany they have given up their cars. Vaubans streets are completly car free. 70 percfent of Vauban's families do not own cars ansd 57 percent sold a car to move there. Heidrun Walter said"When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happierthis way". According to "Car-free dat in spinning into a big hit in Bogota" by Andrew Selsky in Bogota,Columbia they have been without cars for 3 years. Also Carlos Arturo Plaza said "It's a good opportunit totake awat stresss and lower the air pollution".  According to "The End of Car Culture" by: Elisabeth Rosenthal recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as each year goes by. The number of miles driven in the United States¬† peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily afterwards, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Adivor Perspectives. People who stopped driving there cars as a result of hard times may not find a reason to go back to driving if they are saving money.  So I believe that they're many reason to have a car. However they're many advantages to limiting your car use. You can think of yourself as doing a good deed to the earth when walking somewhere or riding your bike are catching the bus. You can have a clear mind and seize stressing so much. Also you can save money I think that everybody likes to save money one way or another. Instead of drivng your car to the mall you can save that money and catch the bus to the mall and buy that new purse that you have been dying to get.    		0
Title: The Pros and Cons of Graduating Early from High School  As an 8th grader, I have often wondered about the benefits and drawbacks of graduating early from high school. While some students may think that graduating early is the key to success, others may find it to be a stressful and challenging experience. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of graduing early, and evaluate the possible consequences of this decision.  One of the main benefits of graduating early is that it allows students to get a head start on their college education. By completing their high school requirements early, students can take college courses and get a feel for college-level work before they even graduate from high school. This can be especially helpful for students who are unsure about what they want to study in college or who want to get ahead of the game. Additionally, early graduates may have more time to focus on extracurricular activities or to pursue their passions, as they will have more free time during the summer months.  However, there are also several drawbacks to graduating early. One of the most significant disadvantages is the increased amount of homework and pressure to perform. Early graduates may have to balance their college coursework with their high school responsibilities, which can be overwhelming and stressful. They may also feel disconnected from their friends and family, as they are no longer in the same school and may not have as much time to spend with them. Furthermore, early graduates may have to move away from home to attend college, which can be difficult for both the student and their family.  There are also several possible consequences of graduating early that students should consider. For example, early graduates may experience stress and depression as they try to balance their workload and adjust to college life. They may also struggle to make friends and feel disconnected from their peers, as they are no longer in the same school and may not have as much time to spend with them. Additionally, early graduates may face financial challenges, as they may not have as much time to save money for college or to apply for financial aid.  In conclusion, while there are some benefits to graduating early from high school, there are also several drawbacks and possible consequences to consider. Early graduates may		1
Cars are very important to the life of a modern person. The car gets you where you need to go in the time that you want to go in. There are ways to limit car usage and still get your transportation to where you need to go. There are some advantages to not using cars all the time. One advantage is that if we stop using cars, then pollution will drop drastically. Another advantage to us not using cars is that we get plenty of exercise while we do other things than just sit in our cars.  Paris, France. Known for being the city of love, but doesn't have a certain love for cars. They banned car usage after days of nearrecord pollutionsource 2 paragraph 10. In order to make sure that the residents don't use their cars still the placed a 22euro fine 31 for anyone still drivingsource 2 paragraph 11. After only just a few days, congestion was down almost 60 percent in the capital of France source 2 paragraph 14. In the United States, most kids these days aren't driving as much as they used to. They are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses each year source 4 paragraph 29. If this keeps up, then lot of sociologist think that this will have a huge effect on the environment, which will lead to the end of pollution problemssource 4 paragraph 34. This advantage of having less car usage will not only help the earth, but it also will help the things on the earth including us humans and animals.  The final advantage that limiting car usage is that we will have plenty of exercise. A mother of two that had a car but the sold it in Germany said " When i had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way"source 1 paragraph 3. She usually walks down the street to and from wherever she goes. exercising is great for your health and you can just start by walking, biking, skating, roller blading and many more ways to get to where you need to go. In Bogota, Columbia millions of people hiked , biked, skated, or took buses to work source 3 paragraph 20. "It's good opportunity to take away stress..." source 3 paragraph 24 said businessman Carlos arturo Plaze when he was asked about the banning of cars for the third straight year in Germany source 3 paragraph 24. Stress isn't good for your health and excercising is great on removing that stress from your body. Excersisng is a great advantage to limited car usage because you reduce stress, work out, and feel better all while you get to where you need to go at the same time.  The advantages that everyone gets from limited car usage is that the pollution will go down, and you get better exercise. If pollution goes down then you will have a better earth for everyone to enjoy, but you can't enjoy the earth if it's congested with polutted air. You also get great exercise when you walk, bike, skate to wherever you need to go instead of sitting in a car to go to your destination. These are only some of the advantages that you get when you choose to limit your car usage, but there are plenty more that you will experience as soon as you limit the usage of cars.		0
Why We Shouldn't Use FACS Technology in Classroom  FACS technology shouldn't be used in classrooms, and there are several good reasons as to why. Some of the things that people value the most are their money, a good education, and privacy. Implementing FACS technology can disrupt all of these things that people value.  First of all, the author of this article, Nick D'Alto, never even mentions the cost of this technology. Seeing as this technology isn't even fully developed yet, it would presumably cost millions of dollars in research to even get a fully developed working product. When new technology comes out, it is usually more expensive then anything else on the market. A school is the last place that should be using its resources for an emotion reading system. Most schools are lacking funding and resources, which is leading to cuts in many music and athletic departments. Another pretty well known fact is that schools spend less money on cafeteria food then JAILS do. If a school is getting additonal funding these are the types of things that they should be spending it on, not useless emotion readers.  This goes into the second reason, which is effectiveness and practicality. How do we know that what this computer is saying is actually correct. Sometimes, there are some things that advanced technology just cannot solve. A computer may sense a sad or confused look on a student's face, but that doesn't necessarily tell you WHY they are sad or confused. Dr. Huang from the article says that based off of the look on your face, the computer could modify the lesson. First of all, if a teacher is teaching a lesson, it probably wouldn't want a computer modifying what he or she wants to do. A teacher shouldn't modify the whole lesson for the entire class, just because someone has a certain look on their face, for reasons that may not even be school related. Modifying a lesson for students who aren't even struggling could potentiall ruin the way they learn, and how quickly and effectively they learn and understand concepts. If a teacher senses that a certain student is confused or not paying attention, they could always talk to them after class and fix the problem, which is a much more effecient and effective way of doing it.  A third reason that this FACS technology shouldn't be implented is for privacy. While the author does list some useful applications for this technology, such as surgeries and video games, common computers for everday use is not where it should be used. One reason that people fear this advanced technology in their own computers is for privacy. Many students probably don't want a camera in their school laptops constantly scanning their faces to see what kind of emotions they have. Many students would see that as creepy and intrusive, and would probably complain to the adminstration to remove it.  People value many things in life, but some of the most important are their money, a good education, and and their privacy. Having this FACS technology in schools can ruin all of these things, which is why using this technology in a classroom is not valuable.          		0
I disagree with student having to have a grade B average to be able to participate in school activities because it's not so easy for some kids to keep their grades up when they also have school activities and making this new rule would be taking a lot of fun opportunities from students that have trouble with school work.  First ,I disagree because it's not easy for some kids to keep their grades up when they also have school activities. Students are going to be put under a lot of pressure if they have to keep up with school work and take school activities which could cause stress. Also students sometimes won't be able to keep up with all the work and activities after school.  Next, I disagree because making this new rule would be taking a lot of fun opportunities from students that have trouble with school work. Students could have scholarships from playing basket ball and football which are school activities and could make them successful in life but if they have to still get a grade B average then this makes it harder for them to achieve.  Students don't deserve to be put under pressure like that because its bad for their health.  In Conclusion, I disagree with students having to have a grade B average to be able to participate in school activities because it's not easy for some kids to keep their grades up when they also have school activities and making this new rule would be taking a lot of		0
Driverless cars seem like an amazing jump into the future.  They would be a great addition to public transporation or maybe even personal use.  Google has already made some effort to making this dream a reality.  Although, these cars are not fully independent to be driving by themselves.  I believe that driverless cars would not only be better for our means of public transportation, but better for our environment as well.  Googles invisions would highly support my position.  The company is making efforts to have a public transportation system of driverless taxis.  With this improvement, today's taxis fuel usage would be halfed.  Ultimatly, the less fuel used is almost always better for our environment.  Although, it seems with every advance in technology, there is often a down side. The driverless cars are not exactly safe with modern technology. It is said that the cars can only do so much, needing a human to do some work at times.  The cars would need help with complicated traffic, work zones, and accidents.  Some accidents could even come from the cars themselves.  With the good and bad, driverless cars have much improvement to reach better safety requirements.  They wil help with minimizing the usage of fuel and public transportation trafic.  These cars have a ways to go, but thats nothing automakers can't solve.		0
You people could really do good with your life. You should join the SeaGoing program for sightseeing, a good expirence, and helping others recover what they have lost. Sightseeing is great becaue you get to see things that wil probably be a once in a life expirence. Getting a good expirence from all of this would be positive for your mind and your body. Helping others is the main reason that you should do this whole SeaGoing program! It woud be great for you to get out and see the world!  It would be great for you to go out and see the world, and it is pretty amazing. The trip to Europe is pretty educational, and humbling. You can learn about tides, and seafare, as well as swells and knots. These are all things I have learned over my "nine trips---the most of any SeaGoing Cowboy." It is also great for getting to know others, and learning about different cultures. Another very interesting topic that is brought up when you sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys is the sightseeing.  Sightseeing is a great part of these trips. You see, when you get to wherever you are delivering you don't have to do the drop off as well. All you have to do is wait for the sailors but until then you get to look at the attractions. For instance, I saw "the Acropolis in Greece" which normally you have to buy plane tickets or boat tickets to get to Greece but when you join you get see these attractions virtually free! I also got to "take a gondalo ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water!"  But the most important part is helping others.  Helping others is the whole reason you should sign-up. You are doing somethining good, not for your self, but for the world, or a specific part of the world anyway. You are also stepping out of your way to help others, you will be rewarded for what you did on Earth in heaven. You will probably, unknowingly save lives while doing this. Helping people is actually good for our brains, it makes us more satisfied with ourselves and we become happier, healthier, and more fun to be around!  You may be thinking we shouldn't go because we like our lives here. Well step outside your comfort zone, stand up for those people who need us, and be the man that says "I will go and help these people!"  So, in conclusion you should come and join SeaGoing Cowboys and help us help others, see amazing things, and just have a good time! Come and let us save people, have a good time ourselves, and see wonders beyond our home!		0
Four-Day Work Week with Ten-Hour Days in a School Setting: Implications and Impacts  Introduction  In recent years, there has been growing interest in implementing a four-day work week with ten-hour days in a school setting. While proponents argue that this would improve work-life balance and productivity, opponents argue that it would negatively impact students and the school's operations. This essay will explore the implications and impacts of a four-day work week with ten-hour days in a school setting, with a focus on the effects on students with part-time jobs, energy and resource conservation, and potential drawbacks.  Impact on Students with Part-Time Jobs  One of the main concerns with a four-day work week with ten-hour days is the impact on students with part-time jobs. Many students rely on their part-time jobs to support themselves and their families. A four-day work week with ten-hour days would reduce the number of days they can work, potentially leading to a decrease in their income and financial stability. Additionally, students may struggle to find shifts that accommodate their school schedule, leading to further scheduling conflicts and reduced hours.  Energy and Resource Conservation  Another potential benefit of a four-day work week with ten-hour days is the potential for energy and resource conservation. By reducing the number of days in the workweek, schools may be able to conserve energy and resources by reducing their use of electricity, water, and other resources. Additionally, a four-day workweek may lead to reduced absenteeism and improved employee morale, which could lead to increased productivity and efficiency.  Potential Drawbacks  While a four-day workweek with ten-hour days may have some benefits, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. One concern is the potential for increased stress and burnout among students and employees. Ten-hour days may be too long for some individuals, leading to fatigue and decreased productivity. Additionally, a four-day workweek may lead to increased pressure on students to complete their work in a shorter amount of time, potentially leading to decreased quality of work and increased stress levels.  Conclusion  In conclusion, a four-day workweek with ten-hour days in a school setting has both benefits and drawbacks to consider. While it may improve work-life balance and		1
The Face is just a natural landform on Mars.  Scientists made the conclusion about the Face based on facts.  Also, the camera scientists used was great at capturing the Face, and the Face is very similiar to landforms we have on Earth.  These reasons are why the Face is a natural landform.  The Face is a natural landform because scientists made the conclusion based on facts.  Throughout the article, scientists took various photos of the Face.  In all of these photos, scientists concluded that it was just a natural landform.  Also, scientists study Mars often, they have never seen any traces of alien artifacts.  There are more facts to believe the Face was a natural landform than an alien aritifact.  Another reason to believe the Face was just a natural landform is because the camera they used was very good at detailing the Face.  In paragraph 10, the article states that each pixel spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel from the photo in 1976.  This means the photo was a good picture to study off of.  Also, in paragraph 11, the article says the camera could have captured things like planes, pyramids, or shacks.  If there was anything like that on Mars, the camera would have seen it.  Since we did not see anything through the camera, we do not have a reason to believe the Face was an alien artifact.  Lastly, the Face is very similar to what we have on Earth.  In paragraph 12, Jim Garvin says the Face looks a lot like a butte or mesa. He said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.  We know it is just a natural landform because we know what a natural landform looks like, but we do not know what an alien artifact looks like.  We can not make an assumption when we have facts.  In conclusion, the Face is just a natural landform.  We have many reasons to believe this because of reasons like the camera, facts, and similar things we have on Earth.  There are a lot of facts and reasons connected to the Face supporting it just being a natural landform.		0

Driving cars may seem like the best way to get from point A to point B, and in many ways, it is. Cars are fast, they are comfortable, and they can fit multiple people. The auto industry is big because of these factors. Though studies show that cars, may not be the best option for the environment and therefore, ourselves.  There is a city in Germany, Vauban. This city is almost completely devoid of cars. How do they do it? Well most of them ride bikes, or simply walk. If there is a distance to far for biking or walking, there is also a tram that runs through the city. The people who live in this city seem to be incredibly happy "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier now" Source 1 says Heidrum Walter, citizen of Vauban. This trend of separation from automobiles is happening not only in europe, but everywhere in the world. The EPA is advocating "car reduced communities" in the United States. The world is changing "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change" Source 1 The benefit of going carfree, goes beyond making people happier, it might even save the human race. Global warming is a major problem. Though an even bigger problem, is that most people in the US do not believe that global warming even exists. One way that scientists know that global warming is happening, is by looking in the ice of the artic. By drilling deep holes in the artic, scientists can extract tubes of ice millions of years old. Just how you can tell how old a tree is by counting its rings, you can tell how old ice is by doing the same thing. When scientists tested the amount of Co2 in a sample of ice that was formed 50 years after the industrial revolution, then compared it to the level of Co2 in a tube of ice 50 years before the industrial revolution. They saw a remarkable increase in Co2 levels after the industrial revolution. Many people do not know, but mercury looked a lot like earth a billion or so years ago. Now mercury is a desolated wasteland, thanks to the amount of volcanos spewing Co2 into the atmosphere. A similar phenomena is happening all over the world in places like Paris and China. Paris' pollution was so bad, that they had to ban driving for a couple days "On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine" Source 2 In Bagota, Columbia, people take part in a carfree day in order to reduce smog. "Millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday" Source 3 This is another example of people taking the initiative to give up cars, even if its only for one day.  People are finally staring to realize that cars cause pollution to the Earth. Even the president is backing the cause, which honestly might be why more people have not accepted global warming as a fact. The level of driving has decreased over the years "As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995" Source 4 It is fantastic to know that people are finally embracing science as something to learn from, and not something to fear. What we all need to realize is that, our planet will live on millions of years after we are gone. We are not saving our planet by preventing global warming, we are saving ourselves.		0
In today's world, it is often said that having a positive attitude is the key to success and happiness. However, I believe that this is not entirely true. While a positive attitude can certainly help individuals navigate through difficult situations, it is not the only factor that determines the outcome. In fact, there are many instances where having a positive attitude can actually hinder one's ability to cope with adversity.  One example of this can be seen in the case of breakups. When someone experiences a breakup, it can be incredibly difficult to maintain a positive attitude, especially when the other person is actively trying to make the relationship as difficult as possible. In these situations, it is important for individuals to acknowledge their emotions and allow themselves to feel the pain of losing someone they care about. By doing so, they can begin to heal and move forward in a healthier way.  Similarly, losing someone close can be an incredibly challenging experience. While it may be tempting to try and maintain a positive attitude in order to avoid feeling overwhelmed, this can actually make the grieving process more difficult. It is important for individuals to allow themselves to feel the full range of emotions that come with losing a loved one, in order to properly process and heal from the experience.  Furthermore, the prevalence of bad people in today's world cannot be ignored. While having a positive attitude can certainly help individuals navigate through difficult situations, it cannot protect them from the actions of others. In many cases, individuals may encounter people who are intentionally trying to bring them down or cause them harm. In these situations, it is important for individuals to remain vigilant and take steps to protect themselves, regardless of their attitude.  In conclusion, while having a positive attitude can certainly be helpful in many situations, it is not the only factor that determines the outcome. There are many instances where having a positive attitude can actually hinder one's ability to cope with adversity. It is important for individuals to acknowledge their emotions and allow themselves to feel the full range of emotions that come with difficult situations, in order to properly process and heal from them. Additionally, individuals must remain vigilant and take steps to protect themselves, regardless of their attitude.		1
 Car-free cities have become a popular concept in recent years, as the world becomes more environmentally conscious and is looking for ways to reduce the negative impact of car travel on the environment. These cities are defined by a complete absence of cars or vehicles, allowing for a more peaceful and sustainable urban environment.  The concept of car-free cities is not a new one. Many cities around the world have taken steps to reduce their dependence on cars and promote alternative modes of transportation. However, there are some cities that have taken this concept to the extreme and have become completely car-free.  One of the benefits of car-free cities is the reduction in noise pollution. Cars are one of the main sources of noise pollution in urban areas, and the absence of cars in car-free cities eliminates this issue entirely. This allows for a more peaceful and calm environment, which can have a positive impact on residents' mental and physical health.  In addition to reducing noise pollution, car-free cities also help to reduce air pollution. Cars are a major contributor to air pollution, as they emit harmful pollutants such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the air. By removing cars from car-free cities, the air is cleaner and healthier.  Car-free cities also help to reduce traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and the absence of cars in car-free cities eliminates this issue entirely. This can reduce travel time and make it easier for residents to get around, which can have a positive impact on their daily lives.  There have been some negative reactions to the concept of car-free cities, however. Some people argue that the absence of cars would eliminate jobs in the automotive industry, while others argue that it would be too difficult for people with disabilities to get around without a car. However, there are alternatives to cars that can be used to get around, such as biking, walking, or using public transportation.  In conclusion, car-free cities are becoming more popular as the world becomes more environmentally conscious. These cities offer a more peaceful and sustainable urban environment, with reduced noise and air pollution and reduced traffic congestion. While there may be some negative reactions to the concept, there are many alternatives to cars that can be used to get around and reduce the need for cars altogether.		1
While the idea of using a Facial Action Coding System in the educational process would certainly be interesting, I do not think it is nearly advanced enough to be able to be used in modern schools. While the technology may be able to find the hidden emotions behind the famous portrait Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, that does not mean it is in a position to help students learn. Simply put, the Facial Action Coding System does not have the viability, efficacy, or privacy needed in order to supplement learning.  Even if we allowed camera's to scan the faces of students in school, we would not be able to decode their emotions in a speed befiting our educational system today. At the seventh passage, the author states that, "Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile," suggesting that the majority of modern computers do not have the power to actually run the software. The PCs that schools buy are almost never more powerful than the ones bought by consumers for household use, and would thus also not be able to process the data, making the technology rather useless in an educational setting. Even if a school had the funds to buy a computer that could process the data quickly enough to be useful, there are simply too many students for that one computer to process, which would make the entire system useless.  If we were to simply put that first fact aside and instead look at the ability for this technology to assist students in an ideal setting, we still find that students can fake their emotions in order to cheat the system. In the third passage of the artice, the author states, "Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness ... and then associated each with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles," meaning that the software associated voluntary or involuntary movements of the face with emotions. The problem with this system is that students can change the look of their face quite easily, and can thus convince the computer to produce desired results, making the system disfunctional. There are quite a few reasons children, especially young ones, would want to make the software not work, including tricking the computer into moving from the original learning program into a more desired one and them simply wanting to see the program fail through their abilities.  The idea of being able to find out the emotions of all of the chidlren in a school on a whim also rises privacy concerns that would need to be addressed before any program including this software would be implemented. The information gathered from students could be used for selfish purposes, as explained in the sixth passage of the article, "if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different," showing that companies have use for this technology to better their businesses. If ad companies managed to get this emotional information from students all across the country, either from the government itself or through illegal actions, they could use that information to make new products and ads that would try to exploit the emotions of children. Because of this and the added concern of giving the information to the government itself, many parents would oppose a system that tracks and records the emotions of children.  Because of the lack of availablity, the potential cheating of the software, and the privacy concerns involved, the Facial Action Coding System is not able to be used in its current state to benefit schools. While this technology could be used in the future to help students, for example students with mental disabilities, it is not able to do so as it is now. It will be interesting to see what this and similar technologies grow to be, for better or for worse.		0
 Making your own decisions can be a challenging and often stressful experience, especially when it comes to important life choices. While it may seem tempting to take control of your own destiny, the reality is that many people make mistakes and end up regretting their decisions. That's why seeking guidance from experts and authorities is often a much better option.  By seeking advice from people who have experience and knowledge in the areas you need help with, you can gain valuable insights and make more informed decisions. This can be especially beneficial for young people who may not have the same level of experience or understanding as older individuals.  For example, I know someone who was only 17 years old and decided to make their own decisions without seeking guidance. They ended up facing financial difficulties and eventually became homeless. This is a cautionary tale that highlights the importance of seeking guidance from experts and authorities when making important decisions.  On the other hand, one of my friends who is older than me faced similar challenges in their life. They sought guidance from experts and authorities and were able to overcome their difficulties. This experience taught me that seeking guidance can be a valuable tool in navigating life's challenges.  In conclusion, seeking guidance from experts and authorities is a wise choice when making important decisions. It can help you avoid mistakes and make more informed decisions, ultimately leading to a more successful and fulfilling life. So, if you're facing a difficult decision, don't be afraid to seek guidance from those who have experience and knowledge in the areas you need help with.		1
I THINK YOU SHOULD KEEP THE ELECTORAL VOTE BECAUSE IT HELPS THE PEOPLE VOTING AND HELP THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO VOTE AND ALSO THAT THE ELECTORS STILL SHOULD BEABLE TO VOTE AND THAT IT WILL HELP ALOT OF MORE PEOPLE WHO VOTE  THE CANIDATES ARE ALL RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND ONE PERSON HAS TO CHOOSE FROM THE CANIDATES HOW IT WILL WORK AND THAT THEY WILL PICK THE ELECTORAL VOTERS TO VOTE AND THATS HOW THEY WOULD VOTE¬† THEY SELECT A PERSON EVERY FOUR YEARS AND THEY ASSIGN THEM FOR THE ELECTORS THEY ARE OFTEN CHOSE BY CANIDETS¬† YOU WILL ALSO HELP THEM VOTE BECAUSE THEY VOTE AFTER EVERYONE ELSE  AFTER THE PRESIDENT ELECTION THE GOVENER PREPARES THEY WILL ALSO DETERMINE THE ELECTORS THE PRESIDENTS COULD ALSO PICK THEM THEY HOLD OFFICAL RECORDS AS TO WHAT IS BEING VOTED THEY COULD ALSO ARGUE ABOUT IT AND THATS HOW THEY COULD ARGUE ABOUT IT IT WILL ALSO LET THEM SUCCSED IN WHAT THEY WERE GONNA DO THE ELECTORS WOULD ALSO BACK UP THE OTHER PEOPLE. SO EACH EVERY FOUR YEARS THEY VOTE AND THEN THEY GET TO SEE WHO WINS.  THEY CAN GET 500,000 VOTERS AND THAT GIVES A CHANCE FOR THE PRESIDENTS TO THEY WOULD HAVE 55 REPERSENITIVES TO BACK THEM UP AND GIVE THEM MORE ELECTORAL VOTORS SO THE ELECTORAL VOTERS WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO VOTE AND THAT THE ELECTORAL VOTERS ARE THE VOTERS THAT VOTE AT THE LAST MINUTE AND THAT THEY BACK THE PRESIDENT UP AND GIVE HIM MORE VOTES THAN THE NORMAL VOTER.  YES THEY SHOULD KEEP THE VOTERS AND THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP THE VOTERS JUST INCASE THE VOTERS DONT NEED TO COMPARE THE ELECTIONS AND THATS HOW THEY WOULD MAKE THERE FINAL DECISION AND THEN THEY WOULD MAKE THE FINAL DECISION WHO TO VOTE FOR AND IT COMES UP BETWEEN THE STATES.YES THEY SHOULD DO A FINAL VOTE DECISION AT THE END OF IT.    		0
Dear, Principal  I think the new B  average participation rule would be great for most kids, because there are a lot of kids that are smart but don't apply themselves. Most kids think they can goof off and they still get the privileges as the other kids that actually work for the stuff they obtain.  Kids like to just mess around and not understand what it is there actually learning. Then when it comes test time they don't know what it is there doing. When the get homework they don't do it because they don't think it can effect them.  There are many kids that think all they'll need to do is pass with a D, and that they will move on but a D is only saying that they have the basics down, and they don't fully understand it. If they want to get into a good school they are going to have to start applying themselves.  If there is a grade cap on most school activities students will start working harder. The activities should only be for people that apply themselves and work hard so they can get into a good school and get the rewards they deserve.  Principle these are the reasons why we need a grade cap on school activities. So kids could work for what they earn. There's just to many kids who think they can get by in life with just a D or C for a grade.		0
Summer projects are a good and tested tool to ensure students learn over the extended break known as summer vacation. Teacher designed projects ensure fair, equal, and consistent learning across schooling administrations. These projects will make sure that students are tested upon there merit to applied material that will surely be used in their academic future, and will keep their brain on edge during the mind numbing summer vacation.  Teacher approved projects designed by teachers ensure that each student will be guaranteed¬†to be scored and evaluated on their application of the material, not whether or not the child next to them had a better idea of what to make. This would ensure that Generic_Name; who made a info graphic¬†on the dangers of ethanol products for the environment is graded in the same way as Generic_Name; who made a baking soda volcano the size of a small minivan. By having teachers make and set the guidelines of the project we negate the potential problems of having a student design or think up their own. Opponents of this idea would say that this limits a students imagination and creativity that an original¬†project would be gleaming example of; however by giving them this central idea or framework we can have kids express their creativity by using the aforementioned framework and how they can use it to show their knowledge of the subject while expressing their¬†idea on how they can make the project their own. Teachers this way can ensure that they are able to grade students on a more even field by a class basis instead of student by student. This method would make also make it easier to ensure consistent grading to learn where certain schooling needs fine tuning.  Having students graded by a teacher's syllabus¬†or paper makes sure that should changes need to be made on the certain subject or on the project itself is valuable from an academic standpoint. Also should an academic want to study the affects of this project and academic performance¬†against those who do not perform a summer project they would be able to as they have a consistent group they could study. Not having this ability to make changes would be detrimental to a institutions ability¬†to ensure academic growth in students. This would also make it easier on teachers having to grade as compared to having to grade each kid on their own project. Those against say that it has inherent bias against those who do not achieve their prime when constricted by the limits of a syllabus, an example of this being a student who was traveling for majority of break or where unable to locate a syllabus before the break began. Although having this frame would largely negate these problems as year after year they would know what would expected of the children.  Also having this framework would negate any problems with student loafing or economic problems that a student could face. By having a student constrict to a single option this would allow for less fortunate students to have the ability to compete with his or her more fortunate counterparts; as would in the case of someone purchasing more complicated components against someone who would not have that ability which would be the case in many schools across the country such as Generic_City. With regards to student loafing this would allow for less motivated student to be allowed less of an ability to slack off as they would be unable to put together a project within a short amount of time and earn better scoring than someone who spent more time and effort simply because they had "their own idea".  Having teachers make their own project would make for fair and equal abilities to score across whatever lines may be drawn in the sand. Having teachers design their own would allow institutions to make changes to curriculum and lesson plans should students have a weak understanding of the material. having teachers decide how to grade would make it easier for them to also grade against other groups for academic purposes. It is better for teachers, students, and overall everyone if they could decide what to be graded and what to be expanded upon.		0
Policy One  I believe that students are responsible of having phones in school, but remembering to use them at the appropriate time. I feel students should actually get a chance to take on that challenge instead of letting them choose for us. We as students know that it is a reason that we shouldn't have, but teachers need to recognize to that we do need them in school for certain purposes. For example, I ride the bus home at least three times a week. Sometimes I need to call my mother to ask her questions about the transportation problem. I do realize that we do have school phone that I can use for that situation, however the system is not quick enough when you can just get it done right there.  My problem about this rule is why doesn't the rule involve everyone such as teacher, superintendents, and advisors. Why do they text and talk to people on their phone, taking personal calls when they shouldn't be allowed that. They don't have consequences for that action, but students like me do. We get it taken away and if they see it again, possibility that you wont get it until the end of that school year. Us as students know that we can get consequences for cell phones, we also know how to prevent from letting the cell phone actually for being seen. I'm not saying if they allow students to use cell phones on school hours at specific times they would use them in the right ways they need to be used. Basically we need a chance of proving ourselves wrong or could we actually be right. Policy One clearly states to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time and I think students are mature enough to handle this policy very well.		0
Hi, my name Luke Bomberger. I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War ll. I am "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."  When you join this program you will experince lots of opportunies. I will tell some reasons to join the program, just keep reading.  The best reason about this trip is that you get help people who were affected by World War ll. "Helping out on his aunt Kate's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not the dangers at sea." " Besides helping people, I had the side benfit of seeing Europe and China."  Travling was lots of fun also. "But seeing in the Acropolis in Greece was special." "So taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water." I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at Panamal Canal on hs way to China."  When we had time left over we usaslly spent it, will doing fun activites. "Luke also found time to have fun on borad, especially on ruturn trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed."  "Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped me passed the time."  In conlsion, I have now realised even more why why I like doing this. Now that you read this this eassy, I hope that you learned why I loved doing this and that you know a little more about my experince.        		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME, 2/15/11  I heard that you were considering two different policies about cell phones on campus.  Many students are going to be happy that you are considering to change the current rule about cell phones, but I think that the second policy is the way to go.  No cell phones of campus is the best for many reasons.  First, they are extremely distracting because if we are aloud to have them, that is all we will be worrying about.  I know, personally, that my cell phone can make me a different person.  Texting can be addicting, as most teenagers will tell you, but if you allow us to have phones on campus, we are likely to be on it all the time.  Some will say, "I can get away with it" or "the teacher won't even know."  Nine times out of ten, if we have them at one point of the day, they are likely to stay with us and not be put away when they are supposed to be.  Second, many teenagers can be bullied over the phone.  One kid will act like he is someone to else to trick another, and that will turn out to be bad because that person was not who they said they were.  Another reason is that if there are two people who don't like each other, and one of them gets a-hold of the other's number, they can say extremely mean things.  Finally, cell phones are to much of a distraction for us to be aloud to have them on campus.  I hope that you take my opinion into consideration and help it influence your decision.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME         		0
Techology has become a very large part of our society and plays a big role in our everyday lives. As technology continues to advance and people are presented with new opportunities we didn't have before, we begin to rely more and more on technology instead of ourselves or other people. Many schools have proposed the question, "Should students be able to attend classes through video conferences at home? Would they benefit from it?" Allowing students to do this would only hurt them and their futures. It is evident that students need to continue to attend school in person in order to learn how to work with other people, make friends and meet new people, and be able to see teachers when help is needed.  It is important that students continue to attend classes in person so they can learn to work in groups, preparing them for their future. Many, if not all, occupations available for students in the future recquire them to be able to work with others, and share ideas with other people. Working in groups, also allows students to become comfortable sharing their ideas with other people, teaches them to accept criticism, and helps them learn that two brains are better than one when trying to solve a problem. Most importantly, working in pairs or groups teaches students to respect the opinions of other people, even if they don't agree with them, causing them to be more respectful and accepting of others in general. If students were not recquired to go to school, they would miss out on the opportunity that would prepare them to work with other people in the future.  If students ceased taking classes in person, they would no longer be able to meet new people or make connections with friends as easily as they would if they saw them every day at school. Polls have shown that a majority of the friendships students in elementary, middle, and high school have, were formed at school, with few being from extracurricular activities. Going to school, students are surrounded by the same people every day, and are put into classes with a variety of different people, whom they usually may not connect with, where they are able to establish relationships and become friends. This produces more outgoing and friendly people who are able to get along well with others, boosting their self confidence. Students who take classes online would be unable to meet new people which could severely effect their happiness and cause them to feel isolated or alone.  Often after being taught new lessons, students are confused and have questions to ask their teachers. Being in school allows students the opportunity to ask teachers for help and ask questions. Studies show that it is easier for students to learn when face to face with their teacher, watching what the teacher is doing. Many students actually learn from being walked through problems or equations with their teachers, asking questions, and then trying one on their own with a teacher nearby to help if needed. If all students were to video chat with their teacher and try to learn new topics, they would find it very difficult for each of them to be able to ask their questions and grasp what they're being taught, thus causing their grades to slip. However, if students continued to attend classes at school, they would be able to go back later and ask the teacher for help, or find another teacher that could also answer their questions.  Attending school in person, as opposed to online, provides students with an environment in which they can learn to work well with others, make friends and meet new people, and ask for help when necessary. All of these things are extremely important to the development of students both cognitively and socially, allowing them to grow and learn as children so that in the future when they are out on their own, they can prosper as responsible, outgoing, and intelligent adults able support themselves.¬†		0
The electrol college system is an unfair system, people don't have the right to select their own president, they dont have the right to select a president. Because, when people vote they are technically voting for the electors for a candied. That candidate can be a democratic or a republican. In source two it states that electors can choose there opposing candidate. Which declines the the whole voting process. Why do we vote? we vote to select a leader who will defend this country and make america a place of opportunity. The most important reason why the electrol cllege is unfair because of the " winners it take all" rule.  We as american people cannot choose their own government, as it says in source two, that when voters vote they are voting for the candidates electors. Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amount of electoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college, then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair because if the majority of a state for example chose republican candidate, then that would be vague because some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral college, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.  In source two it says that electoral who have been select by the state can choose their opposing candidtade, which is more disatvantgeing to the american people and america's future. for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were "faithless" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america.  In source two and three it states the rule " winner take it all". The votes the other lose the, winning can take it all, that vote that they take from the losing does not count Because the people really didnt mean to vote for the candidate they don't want or the candidate they dont support, its like your money fell on the floor and someone just took it knowing its yours.  In conclusion, the state senators should eliminate the electoral college because they count the majorty votes, and don't count other votes that is not popular as the other candidates vote. also because they can decide vote on an canditate they want based on their opinions and beliefs. and lastly because of the winner takes it all system which is bascially taking the losing candidates electoral votes.		0
Learning and gathering knowledge, skills, and information are crucial for achieving goals. There are various methods of learning and gathering information, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will investigate different methods of learning and gathering knowledge to be able to accomplish a goal. I will also examine ways to improve focus to help obtain better results.  One of the most common methods of learning is through traditional classroom settings. This method involves attending lectures, taking notes, and completing assignments. While this method is effective for some individuals, it may not be suitable for everyone. For example, some people may learn better through visual aids, while others may learn better through hands-on experiences.  Another method of learning is through online courses and resources. With the rise of technology, online learning has become increasingly popular. This method allows individuals to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. However, it can be challenging to stay motivated and focused when learning online.  One way to improve focus is through meditation and mindfulness practices. By focusing on the present moment, individuals can improve their concentration and focus on the task at hand. Additionally, breaking tasks into smaller, manageable pieces can help individuals stay focused and motivated.  Another way to improve focus is through physical activity. Exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function and increase focus. Engaging in physical activity before a task can help individuals stay focused and improve their performance.  One example of using these methods to achieve a goal is a student who wants to improve their grades. The student may attend traditional classroom settings, take notes, and complete assignments. However, they may also use online resources to supplement their learning. Additionally, the student may practice meditation and mindfulness to improve their focus and motivation. They may also engage in physical activity, such as running or practicing yoga, before studying to improve their cognitive function.  In conclusion, there are various methods of learning and gathering knowledge, skills, and information. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and individuals should choose the method that works best for them. Additionally, improving focus through meditation, mindfulness, and physical activity can help individuals obtain better results. By using these methods and techniques, individuals can achieve their goals and reach their full potential.		1
Have you ever thought of joining the  "Seagoing Cowboys."  Like Luke Bomberger he thought it was an amazing program. Seagoing Cowboys take care of live stock that are being shiped to countrys or states. Luke Bomberger was asked to join with his friend Don Reist Luke could not give up this amazing opertunity so he toke it. Luke Bomberger decided to become a Seagoing Cow boy.  The year was 1945 World War ll had just ended in Europe and many outher contries. The army had just sent some Seagoing Cowboys. The Cowboys were sent to help restore food supplies and animals. 44 nations joined together for the UNRRA. The UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys." Luke and Don signed up to help with rebuilding Europe.  Luke signed up for the trip to go to Greece he turned 18 befroe going there. Besides going to places you would have the benifit of seeing sites such as Acroplis in Greece, or taking the gondola ride in venice Italy, a street with water. A Seagoing Cow boy also has very long trips to get to places somtimes like when Luke toke two weeks to get to the Atlantic Ocean or when it took a month to get to China. Seagoing Cowboys also have to care for thre animals and might run out of food to give them on one of there trips. A Seagoing Cowboys has thre advantages and their disavantages.  Seagoing Cowboys would have to leave their familys behind but they new that they would see them again. Seagoing Cowboys had a lot of fun on the trips that they came back from droping of the animals. They like to play games such as table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games. The games helped pass time until they got home to see there familys. One night Luke sliped and broke some ribs his crew would not let him work until he healed up. Seagoing Cowboys are like your family that is away from home.  When your part of the crew you have your own little family. When you go to what all the bad things in the world are you want to help them out . When Luke was done created awarness and that stayed with him. Luke hosted a number of internathinal students and exchange students visitors for many years.

Have you ever been on a road trip or just a long drive and said "I wish this car could just drive itself", that may become a viable option sooner than you might have though. Google and other major corporations have been working around the clock for years trying to make that dream become a reality and are getting closer than anyone could've imagined, but do you really trust a computer with the lives of your friends and family.  Yes technology has come a long way the past few years and for the most part it has made positive impacts on our day-to-day lives but we cant just forget the downsides of all these new tech gadgets. Think about how easy it is for someone to hack into your laptop or phone and get all of your person information. How long do you think it would take skilled hackers to find a way to get control of your self driving car once they are released, 6 months maybe a year and you could have thousands of peole trying to gain full power over your vehicle and they just might be able to.  Lets also not forget that computers and other devices malfunction quite often, more frequently then we'd like to admit. Have you ever been on your laptop while constructing an important document and your system just completely shut down without saving? That has happened to me and many people I know and we all thought it was one of the worst things that could happen. Can you imagine what would happen if you're on the middle of the expressway taking a nice road trip with your family and your car just shuts off in the middle of the highway surrounded by 10 ton trucks that could crush your small self driven car like it was an empty soda can. I can risk losing papers on my hard drive due to a malfunction, but im not willing to risk my life to one.  Sure everyone has dreamed of a self driving machine but now that you know all the things that could inevedably go wrong, does it really seem like that cool of an idea? Lets say you can afford a car that drives it self, can you afford the damage you could be held responsible for if something goes wrong with the vehicle. Can you afford to maintain and repair a 2 ton computer that has enough technology to drive you around? I hope that the facts i have told you today will help clear up and questions you've had about if its worth it or not because when you really think about it, it's truely not. 		0
Some may argue that teacher-design projects are the best way for students to continues to learn during their break, but summer projects should be student-designed because of these three reasons: it allows the students creativity to flow through their projects, when allowed to chose what they want to do, students work better on projects;¬†because learning should be fun, students tend to enjoy the work they're given when allowed to do it their own way.  As children, our imagination tends to run wild, hence the crazy colorful drawings we bring home from kindergarten, or the weird concoctions we put together in our make believe kitchen; But as we get older we tend to lose that, weather it may be through age or other things, our imagination isn't as it was when we were younger. When given free will to do whatever we want on a project, students get to tap into that wild imagination we have locked away somewhere in our brain, a creativity that we don't get to use as often as we could. some of this is due to having teachers decide on what or how we should do our work. At times we are given a sheet of paper that tells us how and what our project should look like; because of this our creativity has no space in the box that we are forced to fit into. If given a chance to choose, more often than not, not only teachers, but our peers and our parents get to see what its kind of like inside our brains. Through our creativity you can learn what the person behind the creativity is like.  When a student is given free will over a task given, it is a high probability that they will do their best to make the project amazing. In many cases student do better on any sort of assignment when given the chance to choose how they want to complete said assignment. One of the best feeling a student has is having a peace of mind knowing that they turned in an project that they did their best and worked hard on, and knowing that their hard work payed off. Through this, students learn to do their best in anything that they do, no matter it being school work or work outside of school. My Dad would always say "Your school is like your second home, what you learn at home is what you will apply and use in the real world." Giving the chance to students, if the summer projects were to be student-designed, students will work better and harder on it than if they were teacher-designed.  As I stated previously, learning should be fun. it is human nature to want and to enjoy presenting a project that we've worked extra hard on to our peers and our teachers. Being able to do what we want when it come to projects is enjoyable for the students and the teacher. People work better when they enjoy the task given to them. Using our creativity on a certain subject makes the learning experience enjoyable. The process in which we go through creating projects should be enjoyable. From the planing to the reaserch to assembling the the project, every step it takes can be a fun learning experience, if given the chance.  As we grow up we get lesser chances of using our creativity. Having teacher-designed projects, most of the time, hinders our creativity from coming through our work. Student-designed projects will give the student a chance to show their creativity, and through this they will work better on their project, which will then make it a fun learning experience not only for them but for their peers and even their teachers.   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
 People who value their own ideas and make their own decisions are the ones who can achieve great success in life. For example, when someone wants to start a business, they may decide to create their own marketplace or store, rather than going to experts or authorities for help. While this may seem risky, it can ultimately lead to greater success if the person's ideas are sound and they are able to execute them effectively.  However, it is important to note that life is not always easy, and sometimes difficult decisions must be made. In these cases, it is important to seek guidance and support from others, whether it be from experts or loved ones. It is not always necessary to go it alone, and seeking help can often lead to better outcomes.  Ultimately, the key to success in life is to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve and the willingness to take risks and make difficult decisions. By valuing your own ideas and making your own decisions, you can create a fulfilling and successful life for yourself.		1
As the challenges of graduating high school in three years become more established, we need to be aware of the potential issues and how we can best address them. Many students who finish high school in a condensed timeframe may struggle with the adjustment to college life. Not participating in typically senior years activities such as prom, senior trips, or senior lock-ins can be disappointing for these students. Being in advanced classes also put pressure on students to keep up with their studies and peers at a more accelerated pace.  In order to battle these issues, it is important for students to be well prepared for college. They should actively participate in extracurricular activities, and take advantage of on-campus support services such as mental health counselors, academic advisors, and mentors. Additionally, for students who are looking for more immediate relief, there are alternative options available, such as taking college classes while still in high school or taking a gap year between high school and college. For those experiencing financial difficulty, seeking financial aid or applying for grants and scholarships is a great way to help cover college expenses.   Overall, it is important for students graduating high school in a condensed timeframe to be aware of the potential issues they could face, but also possible solutions. With ample preparation, support, and alternative options, students can still achieve their post-secondary dreams.		1
 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a methodology used to analyze human facial expressions in order to identify the underlying emotions and mental states. It was developed by Paul Ekman, Wallace V. Friesen, and Richard A. Maibach in 1972 with the goal of providing a standardized way to identify different facial expressions and their associated emotional states.  The FACS system involves the identification of action units, which are specific facial movements that can be used to represent the different emotions and mental states. There are a total of 46 action units that have been identified in the FACS system, and they are grouped into seven categories: eyebrows, eyes, eye region, nose, mouth, chin, and forehead.  Using a combination of these action units, a FACS coder can identify the different facial expressions and the emotions and mental states that they represent. This information can be useful in a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and marketing.  For example, in psychology, the FACS system can be used to study the way that different emotions are expressed on the face. By identifying the specific action units that are used to represent different emotions, researchers can gain insight into the underlying neural mechanisms that are responsible for the expression of these emotions.  In marketing, the FACS system can be used to analyze consumer reactions to different products and advertisements. By identifying the facial expressions that are used in response to these stimuli, marketers can gain insight into how consumers are feeling about the products and services and make adjustments accordingly.  There are some limitations to the FACS system, however. For example, it can be difficult to interpret the facial expressions of individuals who are not explicitly expressing emotions, such as those who are trying to conceal their emotions. It is also important to note that the FACS system is not universally accepted, and there is some debate among researchers about the most effective way to use it.  Despite these limitations, the FACS system remains a useful tool for understanding human facial expressions and the emotions and mental states that they represent. By providing a standardized way to identify and interpret these expressions, it can help researchers and practitioners gain valuable insights into the way that humans communicate and interact with each other.		1
 The Challenge of Exploring Venus  In the article, "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author presents the argument that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author acknowledges the risks involved, but argues that the potential benefits of studying Venus make it a valuable endeavor. In this essay, I will evaluate the author's support for this idea.   Firstly, the author supports the idea that exploring Venus is worth the risks by acknowledging its potential benefits. For example, the author suggests that studying Venus can help advance our understanding of the planet's atmospheric conditions, which can have implications for future space exploration missions. Additionally, studying Venus can provide clues about the formation and evolution of Earth-like planets. If we can better understand Venus' conditions, we may be able to make better predictions about the potential for finding habitability on other planets.   Secondly, the author supports the idea by discussing the specific difficulties inherent in studying Venus. The author recognizes that Venus is an extremely dangerous environment to explore, with surface temperatures exceeding 460  C and an atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. These conditions make it challenging for humans or equipment to survive, but the author argues that these same difficulties make it a valuable study. By overcoming these challenges, we can gain new knowledge about the conditions necessary for life to thrive.   Finally, the author supports the idea by discussing the potential risks involved in exploring Venus. While the author acknowledges the dangers, he also argues that these risks are worth taking in order to advance our understanding of the planet. The author notes that we have already sent probes to study Venus, and that future missions may bring even more significant discoveries. The author argues that the benefits of this research outweigh the risks, and that we should continue to pursue exploration of Venus even if it means facing difficult conditions.   In conclusion, the author provides several pieces of evidence to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. By acknowledging its potential benefits, discussing its challenging conditions, and addressing the risks involved, the author argues that we should continue to pursue exploration of Venus in order to advance our understanding of the galaxy. While the challenges are significant, the potential rewards are even greater, and the pursuit of knowledge of Venus is well worth it.		1
The Challenge of Exploring Venus, is a very detailed, reliable article. It seems as though the author thinks it would be a good idea to find a way to have an exploration take place on our neighboring planet, Venus. In the authors final paragraph they state that "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." wich strongly indicates that the author thinks it would be good to invest in such an exploration. For the most part the author supports his idea well but there are some parts of this article that could possibly make some readers confused.  In most of the paragraphs of this exerpt the author is stating the danger that is involved in making an exploration to Venus. As much as the author states towards the beggining and end of the article how they beleive it would be a worthy pursuit, for most of the body paragraphs they dont seem too optimistic about the exploration. For example in paragraph 2 the author says that Venus is,"a challenging planet for humans to study ". Another example from paragraph 4,"The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?". These types of remarks seem slightly reoccuring in this exerpt. They also show that the author seems like they have alot of doubt in NASA's capability to continue with such a major journey.  The writer of this article was very knowledgable about the terms and conditions of mars,and what it would take to be able to do research on the planet itself. The majority of this exerpt consists of diffrences and similarities that venus and our home planet, Earth, have. For example in paragraph 2 the author exclaims that the two planets are referred to as "twins". An example of how they were contrasted, in paragraph 3,"On the planet¬ís surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." As you can see, the detailed facts in this exerpt are clearly reliable.  As much as it may be controversial, because the author did show alot of negative effects to exploring Venus, they did bring up some reasons how it could be a good idea to make an exploration like this, considering how alot Venus and Earth are. For example in paragraph 4, the author states,"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth." These examples show that the author is guving strong reason why it would be possible to make a expidition to Venus.  The article, The Challenge of Exploring Venus, is very detailed, factual, and strong. Although it may not 100% express that the author is trying to say it would be a worthy pursuit to make an expedition to Venus, this article still would give people alot of information on Venus and reasons why we should or should not go there. This exerpt does express that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, for the most part. It may show more of the dangers and not as much why it would be worthy, but at some parts it does show that it would be a good idea. Some readers might be confused about weather the author thinks its worthy or not, but either way it is still very factual and a strong article to get a lot of information from. 		0
Dear Principal ,  I believe that we should to be able to have our phones in school. I think that we should be able to use them during free time, and lunch. The reason i think this is because there a way to talk to your friends that are not at school or that are at school but your not sitting with them.  Also, I believe that we should use them during free time . Let's say there is a game or event you want to stay and watch , or participate in. You would have to call or text your parents and tell them that you are staying , and to tell them what time to pick you up. I think that we should use our phones in our free time , because if we are not doing anything it is not like were interrupting the class, or ignoring the teacher.  Another reason is, we are not doing anything else at lunch so what's the big deal with using them during a non academic time. We also have games and other fun things on our phones that we like doing . It's a different way to have fun , and yet get into trouble. Also, if we are at lunch we can show our friends something cool or interesting that we have on our phones. If you needed to call your parents to hand in a permission slip , you could just call them at lunch or in your free time.  I hope you understand where I am coming from , a lot of students feel the same way that i do about this phone policy. They also think that this rule should apply to this foundation , and that there should be phones aloud in school , but only in use in free time or lunch.  Thank You for taking your time to read this letter.  Sincerely,  Your student STUDENT_NAME.      		0
I think asking multiple people for advice is a very helpful thing because it gives people more to think about. Different people have their own reasons on their own opinions. It helps a lot of people when asking different opinions especially if the topic is very con traversal¬†like sports on who is better then others and thats why it's good to ask for reasons as well. The person asking might also not know about what he or she is specifically asking advice for.  Asking multiple people is like asking what color is better and why. It's always a good thing to ask obviously if you don't know anything about the topic. Someone can give you a reasonable reason to make you be on one side of the topic more then the other. People's opinions can also give you more knowledge about the specific¬†something. People should always prove their answers especially opinions because¬†different people like to give false information.  Multiple advice from others¬†with reasonable reasons can lead to an actual fact. There is a difference between a fact and opinion but then there are personal reasons. Most are mostly opinion based topics where something is better then the other or someone looks better thats all just actual opinion. When asking people for someones opinions on whatever it is you should compare two people's reasons. Also when asking for advice let them know why you wanna know.  When listening to peoples opinions or advice make sure it always makes sense. Asking for ones advice will want you to listen to others. And when Asking for their advice or opinion make sure you keep asking until you feel comfortable. I know a lot of people dont like when others asking for their opinions but it's actually a good thing sometimes it's more helpful then others think and a lot of people dont like it it because they are either scared or don't know anything about the topic. When people do ask it's mostly because they want to hear if someone else will say the same reason as to why they picked what they picked.  In conclusion asking multiple people for their opinion or advice is con traversal¬†but it does help and it does let you know more about what your asking. Example of asking for this is what is better a stripped tee or a plain tee and why is it better. It's never a bad thing just know when you ask for someones opinion make sure your asking someone who knows a lot about the specific topic or whatever it is. asking multiple people for advice can make you let others know about the specific topic. Don't ever feel embarrassed asking others for advice because once you know a lot about the topic or what ever it is then people will start asking you about the topic so then your going to know what is true and what's not true. Asking others for advice is for things you don't know.¬† ¬† ¬†¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
Many students use their summer vacation as a time to relax and forget the stress of school. In doing so, many of them come back to school only to find that they have forgotten a good amount of what they had learned the previous year. Teachers have found that a good way that they can overcome this problem is by assigning projects for students to complete over their vacation. However, the way in which these projects are designed could either accomplish that goal or make students dread returning to school even more. Summer projects should be student-designed, because it allows students to showcase their creativity, fosters leadership skills, and ensures that students are interested in what they are learning.  Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to showcase their creativity. By allowing students to choose their own project and design it however they see fit, students will be opened up to a whole new spectrum of ideas to explore. Instead of being stuck doing the same old PowerPoint or essay, students can come up with something new that not only is fun to make, but is fun for the class to watch. Earlier this year I was assigned to do a project in which we had to create a PowerPoint on a scientist. By the time the class had watched two PowerPoints, we found ourselves bored and no longer paying attention. Every project was the same thing with a different name tacked onto it. Later in the year we were allowed to do a project in which we could create any form of visual media that we wanted. Come presentation day, we found ourselves excited to showcase the creative videos and songs we had made.  Summer projects should be student-designed because it fosters leadership skills in students. When students are assigned projects by their teachers it puts them in a routine in which they only stick to the instructions that were assigned. If students were instead allowed to come up with a project on their own, they would be taught how to explore outside of a set of rules and create something themselves. I was always a shy person growing up, and loved when I would be given a set of rules that I could follow and not have to stray from. However, once I was given the opportunity to create a project myself to present to the class at the end of the year, I found myself start to break out of the shell I had created for myself. Being allowed to design my own project gave me a way to do things according to my own rules instead of those set by others and learn what it meant to be in charge of what I was doing.  Summer projects should be student-designed because it ensures that students will be interested in what they are learning. When students are given the opportunity to choose a project for themselves, they will find themselves more invested in their work. My biology class once was assigned a project in which we had to find some way to tell the story of DNA. After completing the projects, we would be given a test on it. Our class found that, after completing the projects in the way that we wanted to, we were actually more interested in learning how everything worked. It was no surprise that our class got the highest grade average on that test.  Some may argue that allowing students to chose their own projects might result in projects that are sub par, or not up to the standards that the teachers are looking for. However, simply revising the idea with the teacher before starting the project would easily help in overcoming this problem. When students are allowed to tap into their creativity and come up with their own projects, teachers are helping students learn to express themselves and stand out from others. When we allow students to discover who they are, we are teaching them more than a teacher-designed project ever could.¬†		0
In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author, Nick D'Alto explains how a recent technology called the "Facial Action Coding System" reveals human emotions in pictures. This is actually rather convincing to believe. How can you identify a picture's emotions through a new software? The use of the new technology, "Facial Action Coding System" used to read facial emotional expressions is not valuable to students in classroom because it seems too expensive for a public school to use, it looks to be more useful at images, and video games.  "Facial Action Coding System" is not useful to students in a classroom because it is expensive and mostly unaffordable for all classes. D'Alto explains what this technology is made up of, and its component looks expensive. On paragraph 3 the author explains that, "The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles." (D'Alto 3) Having a 3-D model computer in classes not less than a hundred is money consuming and might ruin the school's budget. Having such prestige technology in class does not mean the students in the classroom will learn better or try changing their facial expressions.  Also, most of these type tehnologies are useful mainly at expensive images such as Mona Lisa portrait. This type of system only helps solve the mysteries behind old images such as Mona Lisa and not students' emotions. The author reveals that. "The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do." (D'Alto 6) This shows that the Facial Action Coding System is mainly useful for such mystery portraits. It only helps solve people's curiosity rather than help students in classrooms.  Lastly the new technology also help make computer expressions more real in video games. Dr. Huang explains that, "The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive__ for video games or video surgery." (D'Alto 6) This evidence shows that the new software is more valuable at helping video gemes to look more real than helping students to study harder or to succeed.  Lastly, the new technology, "Facial Action Coding System" is not relevant for students in classroms because it is unaffordable, mainly useful for expensive portraits, and video games. There are many disadvantages than advantages for using the new technology at schools. The new system is more useful at video games and expensive portraits such as Mona Lisa's than in schools.		0
 It is a common belief that individuals who are always doing something achieve more than those who are inactive. On the other hand, some argue that inactivity also serves a purpose and that focusing too much on achieving a goal can lead to burnout. However, it is important to note that having the knowledge, skills, and information necessary to accomplish a goal is crucial to achieving success.  For example, if an individual wants to build a dog house, they must first acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to do so. If they lack the knowledge or skills, they will not be able to build a successful dog house. However, if they have the necessary knowledge and skills, they can accomplish their goal and create a beautiful dog house.  Similarly, if an individual wants to improve their English skills, they must first acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to do so. If they lack the knowledge or skills, they will not be able to improve their English. However, if they have the necessary knowledge and skills, they can accomplish their goal and become a strong writer.  In addition, if an individual wants to take a class, they must first acquire the necessary information to do so. If they lack the information, they will not be able to join the class. However, if they have the necessary information, they can accomplish their goal and join the class.  It is important to note that having the knowledge, skills, and information necessary to accomplish a goal is not enough. One must also have the motivation and drive to put in the effort to achieve their goal. However, having the necessary knowledge, skills, and information is a crucial first step in achieving success.  In conclusion, it is important to have the necessary knowledge, skills, and information to accomplish a goal. With these skills, individuals can achieve anything they set their mind to. Whether it is building a dog house, improving English skills, or joining a class, having the necessary knowledge, skills, and information is essential to success.		1
I think that the principal's idea of making us do an extracurricular activity is a good one. First of all, it's a great way to get us out of our comfort zones and try new things. Like, I know some kids who are super into video games, but they might not have tried out for the basketball team if they didn't have to. And now they're loving it! They're getting exercise, making new friends, and they're part of a team. That's like, super important for our development or whatever.  Another thing is that it looks good on college apps. Like, if we can show that we're dedicated to something, and we're not just slacking off all the time, it shows that we're responsible and motivated. And colleges like that. They want kids who are gonna make the most of their time there, and not just party all the time.  And also, it's just more fun! Like, I'm in the drama club, and it's so much fun! We get to perform in front of people, and we have these awesome costumes and sets. It's like, a real sense of accomplishment when we finish a show and everyone's clapping for us. And we're all friends, so it's like, the best club ever.  But, I can see why some people might not like it. Like, some kids are just not into sports or clubs, and that's okay. They might feel like they're being forced to do something they don't want to do. But, I think they should still give it a try! They might be surprised at how much they like it. And if they still don't like it, they can always quit and try something else.  So, overall, I think the principal's idea is a good one. It's a great way to get us involved in things we might not have tried otherwise, it looks good on college apps, and it's just more fun! So, let's all embrace it and make the most of our high school experience!		1
Dear state senator,  It has come to my attention that there has been some debate on whether or not our nation should continue to use the Electoral College to elect our presidents. Despite the claims that this method is outdated and unfair, I believe that we should keep it in use. The presidental election is held every 4 years and has addressed all issues that may occur.  One such concern would be if a candidate won the popular vote but did not win the presidency as shown here " This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."(source 2). This does seem rather odd considering the seemigly non-democratic nature of this process however, there is a explanation for this. When a person votes for a candidate using the Electoral College, they are actually voting for a slate of electors who in turn vote for a nominee. The reasoning behind this is that a larger state such as California, has a much larger population that a smaller state such as Utah. If we were to chose by popular vote, California would have a very unfair advantage over Utah. While some might then say that the system is still very biased, no one group has any advantage over another as shown here, "All are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons." (source 3).  Another concern was what the outcome would be if both candidates had equal votes. This problem can again be solved by using the Electoral College. While this is very rare it can also lead to pressure for a run-off election which would make the election process extremely difficult. Electoral College is an efficient producer of an obvious winner. If you still do not believe that the Electoral College is truly "fair", we have even allowed Columbia to vote as shown here, "Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College." (source 1). To close off, I would greatly appreciate if you would consider this letter.  Sincerely, A student    		0
Having a positive attitude in life can have an immense impact on our success and overall well-being. Those with a positive outlook are more likely to take risks and persevere through difficult circumstances, leading to greater success. Additionally, those with a positive attitude often inspire and motivate those around them, creating a virtuous cycle of positivity that can lead to even more success. The implications of having a negative attitude as opposed to a positive one are dire; those with a pessimistic outlook are more likely to give up and rarely achieve great heights. Furthermore, negative attitudes can spread, leading to others in the same environment feeling disheartened and possibly discouraged from attempting to reach their goals. Ultimately, it is important for each of us to maintain a positive outlook in life, as it allows us to accomplish more and bring joy to those around us.		1
Our social lives now a days practically depend on cars. The truth is, we don't need cars as much as many of us think. There's probably more advantages than disadvantages to not owning or using a car as often. In articles one, two, three, and four it talks about reasons why we should'nt use a car and what happens if we do so often you tend to have a healthier lifestyle, it helps the environment and ozone, and it reduces stress. So really, limiting car usage helps both you and the environment stay healthy and clean.  People tend to have a healthier life due to limiting their car use. In part of Germany the majority of the residents dont own cars. "As she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.", Article one. This shows how unlike some parts of the world, Germany has many people outside riding their bikes, walking around and many children playing outside other then being stuck inside at home or in a car. In Article four it states, "They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends.". This is in New York, one of the cities with the most traffic and cars on the streets. New York made a program called the "bikesharing program" which has showed great responses and has kids like the ones before mentioned being social and being more active with friends.  Limiting car usage also helps the environment and ozone. In Paris there was a lot of smoke for days and they had to take action. "After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.", states Article two. After this ban the smog cleared a few days later. This shows how easily car can pollute the air and the environment. In Article four it states, "Since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants.". Cars are one of the main reasons for the environment being polluted and it can be stopped easily if people carpooled, rode their bikes or walked.  Not only does limiting car usage and using a different alternative keep us active, it also reduces our stress. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife.", Article three. This was in Colombia where they had a day where no one could use their cars. The people felt relieved to have a day where they could just relax and go outside and get some fresh air. Also in Article one it states, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"." This was also in Germany in a place called Vauban where more than half of the families didn't own cars. This shows how using a bike or walking other than using a car helps you reduce the stress that you have that also includes driving around others that block your way or speed.  In conclusion, limiting car usage tends to help others have a healthier lifestyle, it helps the environment and ozone, and helps others reduce stress. The chairman of the Ford Motor Company in Article four states, "Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve saftey.". There's probably more pros than cons in limiting car usage because all it really does is make our lives harder. The long term effect of using cars is more important than the short term which is getting to your destination which you can do any other way and it's healthier and cleanier for everyone.		0
The use of Facial Action Coding Systems mis a new recent peice of technology that is used to read human emmotion through facial expressions. In this essay I will be telling you why i beleve this is wrong and give you evidence and the downfalls this tech coulkd have.  Peoples emotionms are practically personal buisness of the person who is feeling that way it shouldnt be anyone elses buisness what he or she is feeling. It would also cost alot of money to aforrd the tech that has been built to run the algorithims "Your home PC cant handle the complex algorithims". That excerpt from the last pragraph in the artical tells me this must be very costly to use in a classroom enviorment. One down fall if this new tech also is "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal" this c ould cause problems with being able to trust computer programming to tell us the emptions of anyone because everyone looks diffrent and has diffrent facial expressions for certain emotions or what if some crys when they laugh or laughs when they are frustrated.  So in conclusion this technology can be very costly and may have a chance of ebing somewhat inaccurate and can be an ivasion of someone personal privacy. Hoipefully i opened some new doors to you and hekped you see this technolofy in a diffrent way than before.		0
For quite some time, there's been deep controversies over automobiles and increased carbon emissions poisoning cities worldwide. China, one the most densely populated cities in the world, is also the most polluted with millions of cars on the roads each and every, releasing toxic gases into the city's atmosphere, and creating a ginormous smog. Even in Paris, there were laws that prohibited drivers with even and odd license plates from driving on certain days, due to the increase in pollutants in the city's air. There are many things that can be done to prevent our cities and capitals from becoming toxic danger zones, but all of them need a little initiative to get started.  As said before, Paris once put a ban on motorists with certain plate numbers from driving on specific days. On the Monday the act started, motorists with even plate numbers had to leave their cars at home, or face a 22-euro¬π fine. As many as 4,000 drivers had been fined, accoring to  Reuters , an international news agency based in London, and 27% of those who were fined had their vehicles impounded due to their reaction from said fine. Traffic on Paris streets had decreased by a total of 60%, significantly easing the flow of transportation and lowering the amount of harmful emissions exhausted into the air. This was enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates the following Tuesday.  Three years ago, in Bogota, Colombia, a program had been enacted that has spread to other surrounding countries and cities today known as, the Day Without Cars. On that day, only buses and taxis would be permitted on the roads, allowing the streets of the capital city of 7 million to be devoid of any chaotic congestion, clearing most of the roads. The goal of the program was to enbale and promote the use of alternative transportation and reduce smog. Any violators were charged with a $25 fine. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses, all for the sake of improving the region and getting rid of nasty smog clouds. Even though grey clouds overhead had poured rain on Bogota occasionally, the turnout incredibly immense. "The rain hasn't stopped people from participating," said Antanas Mockus, mayor of Bogota. Other cities such as Cali and Valledupar, also joined in on the fun. Parks and rec centers emerged throughout the city, shattered and askew sidewalks were transformed into smoother and broader sidewalks, and new restaurants and upscal shopping districts have popped up as well. "These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders," says Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asunci√≥n, Paraguay.  So whether it be passing laws on driving cars, pooling in with friends, or just simply taking the bus, there's always something that can be done to limit the usage of cars in today's societies. Alternative transportation may not be as ideal or convenient as taking the family Mustang to work, but it's all for the hope of an easier travel to our workplace and having cleaner air to breathe during the day, and not choking on toxic clouds of death. With the combined efforts of all of us, the adavntages of limited car use are extensive as they are beneficial.  22-euro¬π: 31 US dollars    		0
 In my opinion, the implementation of a curfew for teenagers could greatly improve the safety of the community. The council has stated that the curfew is necessary to keep teenagers out of trouble and away from dangerous situations. This is particularly important as the council has found that many teenagers are still on the streets after 10 p.m., which is a violation of the law.  The potential dangers of being out on the streets after dark cannot be ignored. Criminals often prey on vulnerable individuals, and the presence of a knife, gun, or bomb can be extremely dangerous. By implementing a curfew, the council is taking a proactive approach to ensuring the safety of its citizens.  As someone who has personally experienced the dangers of being out on the streets at night, I can attest to the importance of staying safe. When I was 15 years old, I was walking home from a friend's house at 11 p.m. when I saw a man with a knife behind me. He demanded that I give him everything I had, including my wallet, ID, and not much money. I was alone and had no one to help me, so I ran away as fast as I could.  This experience taught me the importance of being aware of my surroundings and taking precautions to stay safe. It also reinforced the idea that the world is not always safe, and that we must take steps to protect ourselves and our loved ones.  In addition to the personal risks, there are also broader safety concerns for the community. According to the police, a lot of bad things happen in the streets, including kidnappings, assaults, and other crimes. By keeping teenagers off the streets after dark, the council is taking a step towards reducing these incidents and making the community safer for everyone.  Of course, the implementation of a curfew is not a perfect solution. There will always be those who choose to ignore the rules and put themselves and others in danger. However, by setting a clear expectation and providing a safe space for teenagers to spend their evenings, the council is taking a positive step towards creating a safer community.  In conclusion, I believe that the implementation of a curfew for teenagers is a necessary step towards improving the safety of the community. By keeping teenagers off the streets after dark, the council is taking a proactive approach		1
One of the primary arguments for implementing a four-day school week is the potential cost savings. Many schools are currently operating at a budget deficit and a four-day week could help those districts by reducing the amount of money spent on utilities, staff, and transportation. Additionally, students would also be provided with an extended weekend, reducing the amount of stress they experience during the week.   However, there are several potential drawbacks as well. For instance, students may struggle to stay motivated and focused with the extra day off. Furthermore, a four-day school week may also increase the likelihood of teachers needing to miss class and disrupt lesson plans. Additionally, it may be difficult to plan certain events such as field trips, sports games, and Parent-Teacher Conferences.   Ultimately, while a four-day school week may have some benefits, a thorough assessment of both the advantages and disadvantages must be taken into consideration before implementing it at a school. It is important to weigh both the potential cost savings and the potential negative effects of such a schedule in order to make an informed decision.		1
Allowing student's to take classes from home should be a crime! Students would fail to complete assignments on a greater scale than at school. There is a greater variety of things that can occur when a student is at home rather than at school. It just calls for more opportunities the student has to avoid doing school work. students would not benefit from the opportunity to attend classes from home as it would make students more likely to procrastinate, get distracted, and skip valuable classes.  As a student myself, it has been an uphill battle against procrastination. It's an ongoing problem that hasn't gotten any easier as the years go by. Considering the workload that is given throughout the later years of high school, it definitely makes it a lot more challenging to manage. This is an issue that not only affects myself, but also many other fellow students, which can make the problem a lot more severe. Most students have parents who work during the day which means there's no adult monitoring them while they're "taking their classes." This enables the student to engage in other activities rather than attending their classes.  There are countless distractions a student is exposed to while in the comfort of his or her own home. The cellphone is one of the most distracting of them all. It is a gateway to a variety of social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube, and many more. Video game consoles such as Xbox¬†Ones, PlayStations, and personal computers are also an enormous¬†temptation in this day and age. Thus,making it incredibly difficult to focus on what needs to get done especially if there aren't any adults in the household.  Skipping classes has become a normality nowadays, making it one of the major flaws in the school system. This is a problem that needs to be resolved because it's only getting worse with the newer generations. Many Students are using transportation apps such as Uber and Lift to get them from school to their desired destinations. Students would be more prone to this sort of behavior¬†at home for the simple fact that they're allowed more freedom and have greater access to these particular apps. If they don't care enough about their classes whilst there at school they definitely won't care whilst they're at home.  In conclusion, students would not benefit from the opportunity to attend classes from home because it would make it easier to abuse the school provided system in three major ways. It would make it a whole lot easier for students to put off assignments to later dates. It would for sure make it easier for students to get distracted with many things in their households. And it would also make it a lot more easier for students to avoid taking their classes while under little to no adult supervision. While it's clear that there are students who do everything to make their education worthwhile, there are many students who choose to abuse the school system and it's only getting worse.¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
Studying Venus Remains a Worthy Scientific Pursuit  While exploring Venus presents clear dangers due to its extreme environment, the author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" makes a compelling case that learning about Earth's neighboring planet is still scientifically valuable. The article provides strong evidence that the potential scientific rewards outweigh the risks to researchers.   One key piece of evidence is the myriad unknowns that remain about Venus' formation and evolution compared to other terrestrial planets. Determining why Venus developed such a dramatically different climate than Earth, Mars, or even Mercury could offer insights into how planetary conditions diverged early in our solar system's history. Understanding more about Venus' geologic processes and atmospheric chemistry may also help scientists better model climate change phenomena on Earth.   The author also notes that Venus' dense, toxic atmosphere may hold clues about the early atmospheres of Earth and other planets before conditions diverged. Direct measurements of its atmosphere could advance theories about the emergence of life and early environments conducive to life's development. While direct exploration of Venus' surface remains challenging, the article outlines technological advances that have enabled more durable probes and landers, allowing longer-term observations and analysis of conditions below the clouds.  In conclusion, despite the clear hazards posed by Venus' temperature, atmospheric pressure, and composition, the article provides compelling scientific justifications for continued exploration through new probes and orbiter missions. Resolving fundamental mysteries about the formation and evolution of terrestrial bodies in our solar system could shift paradigms in planetary science and climate modeling. While direct exploration of the Venusian surface remains hazardous, technological innovation suggests researchers may one day achieve safer access to study conditions at the planet's surface as well. Overall, the author makes a persuasive case that learning more about Venus through direct observation can yield scientific rewards that outweigh the risks to carefully designed missions exploring Earth's enigmatic neighboring planet.		1
Phones & Driving: By: PROPER_NAME  Drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle for these reasons. The first reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is to inform loved ones if the situation their in changes, they can do so if they have handsfree because if they do not have handsfree it is illegal especially in Georgia. The second reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is that it is nighttime, and they have trouble staying awake, so they call loved ones and have a conversation to help them stay awake, doing so with a handsfree. The third reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because drivers pay a lot of money to get handsfree. Not be allowed to use cell phones at all is like the government robbing them twice. Twice because once for the handsfree, and another for a ticket for using it. The fourth reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because they might need to report a bad driver.  The fifth reason drivers should be able to use cell phones operating a vehicle is because they might listen to satellite radio on their phone instead of listening to FM radio. On their phone because it is better for their money to use it at home and outside of the car and when you are in the car instead of using the satellite radio source on the radio to connect their phone to Bluetooth and play satellite radio there. The sixth reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because someone at your job may not know your on the road and try and call you and you need to answer it.  [Last Name] 4                                                                              		0
 The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a revolutionary technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. As described in the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the system is capable of accurately coding facial expressions and movements, allowing it to accurately predict the emotions of individuals. When applied to the classroom setting, the use of FACS to read the emotional expressions of students can have both advantages and disadvantages. While it can have valuable applications in identifying students who may be struggling or at risk, there are also concerns that it may infringe on student privacy and autonomy.  On the one hand, the use of FACS to identify students' emotions can be incredibly valuable in identifying students who may be struggling or at risk. For example, if the system is used to track the facial expressions of students during class, it can identify students who may be showing signs of stress or anxiety, allowing teachers to provide them with the support and resources they need to succeed. Additionally, the system can identify students who may be struggling with depression or other mental health issues, allowing teachers to provide them with the appropriate care and resources.  On the other hand, there are also concerns that using FACS to read student emotions may infringe on student privacy and autonomy. For example, if the system is used to track facial expressions without the student's knowledge or consent, it may infringe on their privacy. Additionally, there is the concern that the use of FACS may be used to judge or label students without their knowledge, potentially leading to feelings of discrimination or other emotional distress.  Furthermore, there is the concern that the use of FACS in the classroom setting may be used to identify and stigmatize certain groups of students. For example, if the system is used to identify students based on their race or gender, it may lead to the stigmatization and marginalization of certain groups of students.  Overall, the use of FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom setting is a double-edged sword. While it can have valuable applications in identifying students who may be struggling or at risk, there are also concerns that it may infringe on student privacy and autonomy. Careful consideration must be given to the potential benefits and risks of using this technology in the classroom setting, and steps must be taken to ensure that the use of FACS is done in a way that respects student privacy and autonomy.		1
Cars have been used as the main means of transportation for a long time now, but just because we have counted on it for such a long time doesnt mean there are not better ways. There are a ton of advantages for limiting car usage. Lower emissions, conserving resources, and it make us more healthier are just some of the reaons ways that limiting car usage will improve our daily lifestyles.  To begin with, one of the advantages of limting car usage is improved emissions. Today cities all around are poisoning people with toxic air, cars being the main contributers. But it doesnt have to be this way, some cities are doing things to change. In Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, the city enforced a partial driving ban to clear up the global city. Also in Bogota, Columbia has made a difference by incorporating a yearly Day Without Cars. One day out of the entire year is not going to clear up the global air quality but it does opens peoples eyes up to alternative ways of getting around without the use of cars. A businessman even reported that it is a good opportunity to take aways stresses. For the first time, two other Columbian cities have joined in on the event. All of this just proves that cars arent the only way.  In addition to lowering emissions, another advantage of limiting car usage is it would conserve resources. Think about how many cars are in the world. THERE ARE ALOT! So every car in the world uses resources to keep it running, even electric and hybrid cars eventhough they are a great alternative. But most use fossil fuels. The world doesnt have a unlimited supply of fossil fuels. It took millions of years t make the gas we put in our cars. So eventually we will run out and when we do it will take a very long time to get it back. Also think about the generation of people after us. What will we leave behind for them?  Lastly, limiting the use of cars will improve our heath. Before the invention of cars most of the population who walk. Eventhough it would take longer to get from place to place it will benefit use also. American, sadly, is probably the laziest county in the world. You rarely see people walking or riding a bike to and form work on a daily basis eventhough in real busy cities you probably would get to and from work faster cause you wouldnt have to wait in the morning or evening rush hour. Its also ceeper than using your cars, you are going to spend a rediculous amount of money on gas in a year, so think it will help the environment and your wallet.  A study last year has showed that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Maybe we are the generation to make the change to other ways of getting around, advantages being lower emissions, conservation of resources, and a healthier you. So just remember the next time you have ot go to the store, just take a bike.		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  As a student of SCHOOL_NAME, I personally believe that phones should not be allowed at school for three main reasons. Safety, distraction , and responsibility is the main purpose and there are three reasons into what i have to say. Being in middle school is a experience all students would like to remember. Having cell phones on school property is something I am sure all parents worry about .  Safety is the number one goal , when SCHOOL_NAME  was built back in 2009 , I believe. By having cell phones it takes a toll on a lot of our students. For example , PROPER_NAME is in the eight grade and there is a new girl that just moved to Texas and goes to RELATIVE_NAME school. Well, RELATIVE_NAME and her boyfriend broke up , because now he like the new girl , OTHER_NAME. Since RELATIVE_NAME is so popular at her school during class one day she takes her phone out , while they are taking a test and texts all of her little groupie's. Well little does OTHER_NAME know but they all are going to gang up on her at the restrooms. This all occurred through a text message which cause so much to occur at any time .  Distractions are another event that happens when schools allows students to have cellular devices. Instead of paying attention in class , 75% of the students are focused on texting other fellow students. Well one day when threes a big text mainly half of the class has failed the test due to having a distraction , considered as a cell phone . But little does the teacher know that they all failed because they had their phones out causing them to stay off task and have more fun texting and whatever else they cell phones carry .  Responsibility , is something kids should start doing entering middle school, being responsible about everything. Having a cell phone on school grounds is a big one. Once of school grounds its no longer the schools problem if stolen its yours. Your phone could $800 dollars alone , if stolen or lost at school , its your responsibility in order to find what you lost.  So as a eight grader and the experiences I have had in my past , I truly think all electronic devices can be brought to school , but kept off during all hours of your teaching and learning. Also if your bringing them to school on a daily basis it is your responsibility to keep up with what you bring with you at all times. Like our school quote say, "Except Excellence In Everything ".		0
Have you ever wondered how professional athletes got their start? Extracurricular activities have a part in that. From football teams to science clubs, students are participating in life changing events. Students create special bonds over these activities, which makes them so important. It is a good idea for principals to require all students to participate in extracurricular activities. These activities are a good way for students to be introduced to one another, they open up opportunities for these kids, and it gives these kids something to look forward to.  Extracurricular activities are a great way for students to meet and bond with new people. Some students are far more shy and reserved then others may be. There are kids who are sitting by themselves every day, and are constantly alone, but having these kids in a school club or activity could really help them with making friends. Schools are constantly getting new students, but these kids might not adapt as well as one might think. Being the new kid is always hard on students, and is sometimes very scary, but having these kids participating in extracurricular's could help students meet new people and begin friendships. Students might be having a hard time fitting in at their school. Being a part of a club where they are surrounded by others like them could help them realize they are not the only people who struggle, and they have people to rely on. Extracurricular activities could have a great impact on a student's social life.  These activities have opened up countless amounts of opportunities for these teenagers. Some families might not have enough money for their child to play on a professional sports team, but these kids are given the opportunity to represent for their school teams. School sports teams can help kids accomplish things they could only dream of, and it can become a treasured experience for them. Students can get the kickoff to their career with extracurricular activities. Athletes in high school are often scouted out by recruiters for college teams, which can end up with these students playing in national leagues for a living. Teenagers can put on their job resumes what they accomplished throughout their high school¬†sports career, or even on teams like the debate team. Accomplishments as big as winning state and national championships, or as little as winning a game can help managers get a sense of who you are. Extracurricular school activities have a higher value in different ways throughout your life.  Students often have nothing to look forward to as they go to school, but having extracurricular activities gives them something to be looking forward to. Some sports teams or school clubs like to hold after school practices or meetings that are mandatory for the students to attend. Kids might be waiting to go to their football practice, or their team meeting, throughout the day, so they can work hard after school and see their teammates and friends. On occasional weekends, or in some cases every weekend, their team might be playing in a game or going to a competition, which causes students to become excited. Some of these students are very dedicated to what they do and when they go out to compete or to play they give it everything they have, and they feel very accomplished if they become the champion. Some of these kids are not getting out of the house very often, but these activities, like sports, give them a reason to. They might not be leaving their house because they have nowhere to be and nothing to do, but playing sports gives them a reason to become active. These activities are the reason some kids enjoy going to school.  It should be required for students to take at least one extracurricular activity. These activities have created many benefits to a students daily life. Shy kids learn to open up to others and to talk to people, while others get opportunities opened up for them. Most kids enjoy these activities, and look forward to them. In the future, more schools should be opening up to extracurricular activities, and make sure all students have the opportunity to be a part of one.¬†		0
Sure, here is an essay I came up with as an average 8th grade student:  Title: The Benefits of Keeping Yourself Busy  Introduction: Hey there, folks! Today, I'm gonna talk about something that I think is super important for all of us: keeping ourselves busy. Now, I know some people might think, "Ugh, why do I gotta do so much stuff all the time? Can't I just chill and relax?" But trust me, being busy is actually really good for you! (Note: I know I spelled "busy" wrong, but that's just how I would write it in real life üòÖ)  Body: So, let's get into it! Here are three reasons why keeping yourself busy is beneficial:  Point 1: You get more things done! When you're busy, you're not just sitting around twiddling your thumbs. You're actively doing stuff, whether it's homework, chores, or extracurricular activities. And the more you do, the more you'll get done! Plus, you'll feel a sense of accomplishment when you cross things off your to-do list. (Note: I accidentally wrote "twiddling your thumbs" instead of "wasting time". Oops!)  Point 2: You're not considered lazy! Let's face it, when you're not doing anything, people might think you're lazy. But when you're busy, you're showing everyone that you're motivated and willing to put in the effort. And who wants to be called lazy? Not me! (Note: I accidentally wrote "motivated" instead of "motivated and willing". Oops again!)  Point 3: You learn new things! When you're busy, you're constantly trying new things and learning new skills. Whether it's playing a new sport, learning a new language, or volunteering in your community, you're broadening your horizons and expanding your knowledge. And who knows, you might even discover a new passion! (Note: I accidentally wrote "passion" instead of "hobby". Oops again!)  Con		1
If you were told on some days of the week that you are not allowed to drive your car to work, or even use your car at all, would you be glad or happy? Many people don't like it at first, but then grow to like the changes and outcome of not using your car as much, or not having a car. Some people say they are less stressed by not driving, or owning a car. Also people are happier that they are saving money. And they are helping the environment because it is not so polluted and smogged.  First off, when you have a car and drive it around all day, and sit in it all day, its stressful. When you are rushing yourself out the door in the morning so you're not late to work, and then you have to sit in traffic for 30 minutes or so just to get to work, is very stressful. Then on your way home from work is very stressful too. You are coming home in what is called  "rush hour"  where everyone is getting off work around the same time (5-7pm) and you just have to sit in more traffic every day! It is less stressful to not have a car, or use your car that much because you can then walk, or ride a bike. So its more relaxing and you get more time outside and excersizing. Also when you are not using your car, or do not own a car, you become more responsible and have a better track of time. So that just helps out with not being as stressed out!  Another reason why people like not driving or owning a car is that people are saving money. If you are not driving as much, then you dont need to go out and pay for gas as often. If you don't own a car at all, then you don't have to pay those monthly bills of owning that car, plus you don't have to pay for gas at all! Also by not driving as much or not owning a car does not tempt you to go out and spend the day at the mall, or always go out for lunch and dinner with friends. In todays society, many people want to save money. Many people try to save money, but don't know where to start or how to start. And with this way, just may be a helping hint to it.  With not driving as much, actually helps our planet and environment. It may not seem like it, but it does. Your not polluting the environment, and youre just being one more person to help make it a healthier environment and planet. If we had atleast 50 maybe 100 people from each city across America to not use their car 3 days a week, can make a big major difference in todays society in the multiple ways. It would help out in ways like not being as stressed, saving money, and helping our environment too.  There is many reasons as to why not driving as much or not owning a car can help out yourself, and the environment. Just by not driving as much or owning a car can make you a better person by not being as stressed out, you save lots of money by not driving so often or owning a car, and you are also helping our environment and planet by becoming a better and healthier place.    		0
Dear principal,  I think students around the world should not use their cell phones at school because it's a distraction to yourself and others around you. Having cell phones at school could also be a method for someone to communicate with someone else in school and could be, for example, a possible bomb threat. Another reason why students shouldn't have cell phones at school is because they could interrupt a class and therefore could lower their grades.  In case of an emergency, someone could use their cell phones to call the police for help. You could also call you're parents to tell them that your okay. Another good reason to have your cell phone at school is because you could call home to tell your parents to bring you what you might of forgotten at home.  There are many reasons to not have cell phones at school, but the most important of them all is cheating. Someone could use their cell to use as a calculator to cheat for their quiz or test. The worst of them all is black mailing someone and if you do it and get caught by someone, you could me in serious trouble. the reason black mailing is bad is because you could use a phone to mess with someone or take advantage of them and tell them that your going to do something if they don't do this. This is why i think cell phone should not be allowed in school, there are just to many risks and threats to schools.                                    		0
 The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a method of analyzing facial expressions that has been used in various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and marketing. Developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in 1978, FACS has been widely accepted as a standardized system for coding and analyzing facial expressions.  FACS consists of a set of basic actions that can be used to construct any facial expression. These actions are divided into six categories: eye movements, cheek movements, lip movements, eyebrow movements, head movements, and facial gestures. Each of these categories is further broken down into specific subcategories, allowing for a detailed and precise analysis of facial expressions.  The FACS system has been used for a variety of purposes, including measuring emotional responses, studying the effects of aging on facial expressions, and evaluating the effectiveness of different marketing campaigns. For example, researchers have used FACS to study the facial expressions of infants and found that they exhibit a wide range of expressions, including happiness, surprise, anger, and fear.  FACS has also been used to develop new facial recognition technologies. By analyzing the movements and expressions of a person's face, FACS can help to distinguish between different individuals and even predict their moods and emotions.  Overall, the Facial Action Coding System is a valuable tool for understanding and analyzing facial expressions. Its standardized approach and wide range of applications have made it an important tool in various fields, and its continued development and popularity is a testament to its usefulness and importance.  In conclusion, FACS is a standardized system for analyzing facial expressions developed by Ekman and Friesen. This system has six categories, each of which is further broken down into subcategories. FACS has been widely accepted as a standardized system for coding and analyzing facial expressions, and its applications have expanded beyond emotion research to marketing, neuroscience, and facial recognition technologies. Due to its standardized approach and wide-ranging applications, FACS remains an important tool for understanding and analyzing facial expressions.		1
Dear Principal,  I think we should have to perform community service, but not a lot because we are kids and still get homework and have to go to school which takes up most time on weekdays. Most students would probably say that we should not have community service because the weekend is our only time to relax, and sometimes teachers give homework on the weekends too. But I think we can relax weekday nights and do a couple hours of community service a week. I also think that if you truly care for your community then you can take time to make sure it stays clean, or to help a smaller child with school work because any community service can make the community a better place with better living conditions. Taking care of the community is very important because we are the next generation and we should care about where we live and if it is clean environment, and children get help with school work or homework, or if it is a pig-sty and trash is everywhere because no one wants to, or has to clean it up, and no one cares about helping the children with their work.  sincerely, student		0
 In my opinion, Thomas Jefferson's statement that "no one is grateful for people's struggles and hard work" is a pessimistic view of human nature. It suggests that people are only grateful for what they receive and not for the effort and hard work that goes into achieving it. However, I believe that this is not the case.  Imagine a world where people are always grateful for the hard work and effort of others, regardless of whether they receive recognition or not. If people were more understanding and appreciative of the struggles that others face, the world would be a much better place. Instead of being ungrateful, people should be encouraged to show compassion and empathy towards others.  It is important to remember that people are not always aware of the struggles that others face. However, with a little effort, we can make an effort to understand and appreciate the hard work that others put in. For example, if someone is struggling with a particular task, we can offer to help them or offer words of encouragement.  Additionally, it is important to remember that people are not always aware of the impact that their actions have on others. However, we can make a conscious effort to be mindful of our actions and their impact on others. For example, if we see someone struggling with a particular task, we can offer to help them or offer words of encouragement.  In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson's statement that "no one is grateful for people's struggles and hard work" is a pessimistic view of human nature. However, I believe that if we make an effort to be more understanding and appreciative of the hard work and effort of others, the world would be a much better place. By showing compassion and empathy towards others, we can make a positive impact on the world and inspire others to do the same.		1
Dear Principal,  I think the first policy is the best because if a student needs his or her cell phone for an emergency they will have is to call for help. If we had the second policy then if a student sees someone with a gun for example then they can't call the police. Or if some one if beaten and needs medical attention they can call 911. If someone uses them in class or when there not supposed to then the phone should be taken until a parent come to get it. People can save a life with a phone or report a crime that happened before their very eyes.  Policy two could potentially spell the end of someone. Most would break policy two because they might need to call someone after school. The first policy is very easy to follow, just use your phone during lunch and other free periods. There will be the occasional rule breaker for the policy one but policy two will have a lot more. If a schools power is out and people are locked in they will need cell phones to call for help.  In the end policy one has a more beneficial affect for students. Without cell phones someone's life could be in danger and they have no contact with anyone else. With a cell phone a life can be saved or an accident can be prevented. So please if you have to pick any policy let it be policy one.		0
Introduction:  The Face on Mars has been a topic of interest and debate for decades. While some believe that it was created by aliens, I argue that it is a natural landform created by geological processes. In this essay, I will use evidence from the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' to support my claims and convince you that the Face is not a creation of extraterrestrial beings.  Body:  Claim 1: The Face is a result of natural erosion processes.  The article states that the Face is located in a region of Mars known as the "Tharsis bulge," which is characterized by extensive erosion and weathering. This suggests that the Face was formed over time due to the natural erosion of the Martian soil and rocks. Additionally, the article mentions that the Face is composed of a series of valleys and channels that have been carved out by the wind and water, further supporting the idea that it is a natural landform.  Claim 2: The Face lacks the characteristics of a designed structure.  Unlike man-made structures, the Face does not have a clear or symmetrical shape. The article notes that the Face is "ambiguous" and has a "fuzzy" outline, which suggests that it is not a creation of intelligent design. Furthermore, the article states that the Face is not a single structure, but rather a collection of features that have been eroded over time. This lack of uniformity and purposeful design further supports the argument that the Face is a natural landform.  Claim 3: The Face has changed over time.  The article mentions that the Face has undergone significant changes over the years due to natural weathering processes. For example, the article states that the Face has become less prominent over time, suggesting that it is slowly being eroded away. This is consistent with the idea that the Face is a natural landform that is subject to the same geological processes as the rest of the Martian surface.  Conclusion:  In conclusion, the evidence from the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' clearly supports the argument that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. The Face is the result of natural erosion processes, lacks the characteristics of a designed structure, and has changed over time due to weathering. These claims, supported by evidence from the article, demonstrate that the Face is not a creation of aliens, but rather a natural part of the Martian landscape. As a scientist at NASA, I am confident in saying that the Face on Mars is a fascinating example of the geological wonders that can be found on our neighboring planet.		1
Dress codes have been a controversial topic among students and educators for years. While some believe that dress codes are essential for creating a positive learning environment, I believe that they are detrimental to the school environment.  Firstly, dress codes can be overly restrictive and take away students' ability to express themselves. By enforcing strict dress code policies, schools are essentially telling students that their personal style and individuality are not valued. This can lead to feelings of conformity and uniformity, rather than encouraging students to embrace their unique qualities. In addition, dress codes can be discriminatory, as they often disproportionately affect certain groups of students, such as those from low-income families who may not be able to afford conforming clothing.  Secondly, dress codes can create a sense of inequality and reinforce harmful gender stereotypes. For example, many dress codes focus on girls' clothing, policing their skirt lengths and shoulder coverage. This not only perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes but also reinforces the idea that girls' bodies are inherently sexual and in need of control. Furthermore, dress codes can perpetuate harmful gender norms by restricting boys' ability to express themselves through their clothing choices.  Thirdly, dress codes can be ineffective in addressing the root causes of misbehavior. Instead of addressing the underlying issues, such as bullying or disruptive behavior, dress codes simply mask the problem. For instance, a student who is struggling with bullying may be able to hide their anxiety or depression behind a uniform, but the issue still exists. By focusing solely on dress code enforcement, schools may be neglecting more pressing issues that need attention.  Finally, dress codes can create a culture of compliance rather than a culture of respect. When students are forced to conform to dress codes, they may feel resentful and disconnected from their education. Instead of encouraging students to take ownership of their learning and develop a love for education, dress codes can create an environment where students feel policed and controlled.  In conclusion, while the intention behind dress codes may be to create a positive learning environment, I firmly believe that they are detrimental to the school environment. By enforcing dress codes, schools are restricting students' ability to express themselves, perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes, masking underlying issues, and creating a culture of compliance rather than respect. Instead of enforcing strict dress codes, schools should focus on creating an inclusive and respectful environment that values individuality and promotes positive behavior.		1
I believe that raising the minimum wage in our country is crucial for the well-being of workers and the economy as a whole. Currently, many workers are struggling to make ends meet and provide for their families due to the low minimum wage.  One of the main reasons why we should raise the minimum wage is to reduce poverty and inequality. When people are paid a fair wage, they are better able to afford basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. This, in turn, leads to a healthier and more productive workforce, which benefits everyone.  Moreover, raising the minimum wage can boost consumer spending, which is a vital component of economic growth. When people have more money in their pockets, they are more likely to spend it on goods and services, creating a ripple effect that stimulates economic activity and creates jobs.  Critics of raising the minimum wage argue that it could lead to job losses, as employers may not be able to afford to pay their workers more. However, studies have shown that this is not necessarily the case, and that in many cases, employers are able to absorb the cost of higher wages without cutting jobs.  In conclusion, raising the minimum wage is a necessary step to reduce poverty, inequality, and stimulate economic growth. While there may be some challenges to implementing this policy, the benefits far outweigh the costs, and we owe it to our workers to provide them with a living wage.		1
I believe that we should transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. This is because renewable energy is better for the environment and it will not run out, unlike fossil fuels.  Firstly, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power do not release harmful pollutants into the air, unlike fossil fuels which release carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to climate change. This means that using renewable energy is better for the environment and helps to keep our air clean.  Secondly, renewable energy sources are sustainable because they do not run out. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, are finite resources that will eventually run out. By transitioning to renewable energy, we can ensure that we have a reliable source of energy for the future.  Furthermore, renewable energy sources are becoming more affordable and efficient. For example, the cost of solar panels has decreased significantly in recent years, making them more accessible to homeowners and businesses. As technology improves, renewable energy sources will become even more efficient and cost-effective.  In conclusion, transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is the right thing to do for the environment and for future generations. It will help to reduce pollution, ensure a sustainable energy supply, and save money in the long run.		1
 The idea that first impressions are immutable is a widely held belief, but is it true? In this essay, we will explore the factors that can influence our first impressions and how they can be changed.  First impressions are often shaped by our environment and the people we interact with. For example, if we grow up in a religious household, our beliefs and values may influence our first impressions of others. Similarly, if we live in an area with a high crime rate, our first impressions of people may be more negative.  However, it is possible to change our first impressions if we want to. For instance, if we are in a situation where we are surrounded by positive influences, such as money, education, and supportive parents, our first impressions can be more positive. Additionally, the life knowledge we gain can also affect our impressions. For example, if we learn more about a particular culture or group of people, our first impressions may change based on what we have learned.  Furthermore, science fiction and research have shown that our first impressions can be influenced by our environment. For example, studies have shown that people who live in areas with high levels of pollution may have a more negative first impression of their surroundings. Similarly, people who use drugs may have a different first impression of the world around them.  In conclusion, while first impressions may be influenced by our environment and the people we interact with, it is possible to change them if we want to. By surrounding ourselves with positive influences and gaining a better understanding of the world around us, we can change our first impressions and improve our overall outlook on life.		1
As being human nobody is perfect and we don't know everything. This is why we need to ask others but even then sometimes they can be wrong. Getting good advice can sometimes be a challenge, so asking more people is probably a better choice then only asking one person. Looking for advice from multiple people apposed from one person is better because it shows multiple views of the topic, gives a greater understanding on why the advice will work, and includes different experiences of the topic.  Getting multiple views on the topic clears up that there is not any bias coming from a persons advice. What is a bias? Bias is a positive or negative opinion that someone has to an object, place, or person. Bias is not good for giving advice because it sometimes can shows a wrongful or untrue statement about the topic. Multiple views also gives the person more then one way to handle the topic and use different approaches to the situation. An example of bias is views on a person. One person might think someone is mean because of their first impression. Another person might be their best friend and say they are amazing, but both of these opinions are biased because of the way they have interacted with the person. It would be best to find a third party opinion who does not have a biased thought towards the person.  The next reason why asking multiple people for advice is better than asking one person is it gives a greater understanding on why the advice will work. Two people might give the same advice, but give different reasons on how it will work. This can show a variety of knowledge on the concept and give even more ways to approach the situation. In conclusion, asking more people for advice is more knowledgeable because of the different reasons people give for why their own advice will work.  The last way getting multiple peoples advice is better is that different people have different experiences. This means that people have had a scramble of atmospheres of the topic. It mostly applies to places and people not objects. An example is a person deciding on going to a water park. When asking one person they might say that it was very boring and not very exciting, so then they go ask another person and they said they had an amazing time and it's their favorite place to go. Both of the people went to the water park¬†and had different experiences on how it went. It was really just their¬†personal preference and the only way is to go to it¬†yourself to see how it is.  Receiving multiple people for advice is shown to be better then just asking one person because multiple views on the topic clears up any biased that a person has, a greater understanding of the topic because the different reasons on why they advice will work, and multiple experiences that people have had show a variety thoughts when going to a place. Just remember when seeking advice many people have different views and opinions about certain topics.		0
Ugh, I don't know if I'm really feeling it today. But, like, I guess I'll give it a shot. Here's my essay on the pros and cons of changing the school menu.  So, like, the pros of changing the school menu are that it would be, like, more interesting and stuff. I mean, who wants to eat the same old chicken nuggets and pizza every single day? Not me, that's for sure. It would be cool if we had, like, more options that are, you know, healthy and stuff. Plus, it would be fun to try new foods and stuff.  But, on the other hand, there are some cons to changing the menu. Like, it would be really expensive to, like, change everything all the time. And, like, some people might not like the new foods as much as the old ones. So, it would be kind of hard to, like, please everyone. Plus, some people might get, like, allergies or something from new foods, so that would be, like, a bummer.  So, I don't know, like, what to think. I guess it's a good idea to, like, mix things up a bit, but it's also important to, like, be practical and stuff. Maybe we could, like, have a survey or something to see what everyone wants and then, like, compromise or something. That would be, like, cool.  Anyway, that's my essay. I hope it's, like, good enough or something. Ugh, I'm so glad it's almost lunchtime. Can I go eat my chicken nuggets now? Please?		1
Florida Senator-  I had not known much about the electoral college until now, and I am appauled that this election process has been used ever since the establishment of the Constitution-decades ago.¬† The electoral college is unfair, raises dispute, does not provide an accurate representation of the country's vote as a whole, and the process is simply not logical.¬† I feel like we, as a country, could avoid a great deal of dispute that arises, regarding the electoral college voting system, if it were changed to election by popular vote.  First of all, when the electoral college voting system is used, while people may think they are voting for a presidential canidate, they are not.¬† Voters are actually choosing a group of electors that then elect a president.¬† Shouldn't something that has a great impact on our country, such as electing the president of the United States, be chosen by the people living in the country under the president's decisions?¬† Anyone would agree that the people should have the power to contribute to these decisions, yet somehow the electors are taking this huge responsibility into their own hands.  Another issue with the electoral college is that it gives canidates different motives for their campaign.¬† I believe that in an electoral campaign, canidates should be advertising their views equally to all parts of the country, if all parts of the country get to have a say in their voting.¬† However, most of the time, entire countries are skipped over by canidates, as if they don't matter, so that the canidates can talk to states that they find more important to get a vote from.¬† In the election of 2000, a seventeen whole states didn't see the canidates at all, and some of the larger states didn't see a single campaign ad.¬† If the presidents know that they are practically guaranteed the electoral votes by a state, why would they waste their time trying to persuade a state that is already persuaded?¬† It makes sense for the canidates to see "swing states"-the states that are more divided, and whose electoral votes are not guaranteed one way or another.¬† I don't blame the canidates for their methods, but the electoral college itself for bringing about these techniques for campaigning.  The last problem with the electoral college that I would like to address is how the electoral college discourages people from certain states from voting.¬† For example, a Rebulican in California or a Democrat in Texas are obviously aware that their vote isn't going to count towards the majority of the state's votes, or to which canidate the state's electoral votes will be going to.¬† People are definitely more likely to vote if they know that their vote will be heard in some way.¬† The "winner takes all" method is eliminating any representation of the opposing party's vote and discourages the minority of the state from voting.¬† Everyone says that being a good citizen requires being aware and involved with government decisions, and voting whenever possible, yet in the 2012 election, one-half of Americans that were eligible to vote, did not.¬† I'm sure that a good portion of non-voters were influenced by the unfair ways of the electoral college.  As you can see, the electoral college brings about many issues-issues that could be easily avoided if the electoral college was changed to the much simpler and straight forward popular voting system.¬† Our country would be accurately represented, people would feel as if their vote actually makes a difference, presidential campaign would be consistent for all states, and we would actually be able to vote for the specific person we are trying to vote for in the first place.¬† With all of these reasons been said, I think it is pretty clear that the electoral college should be abolished, and that government should change to election of the president of the United States simply by popular vote.       ¬†    		0
Dear principal  I think that we should have policy number one. All student should be ably to use there phones in their free time & in lunch. Its better to have them off in class time. Because if we don't then the student wouldn't learn. They should be turn off or it should be low. Some student would really like this idea about using phones in there free time. There some student who don't like to go to lunch or like to eat and by using there phone they have something to do.  The teacher get mad when there standing up by having there phone i don't think they will be. Most kids use there phone in school when the teacher don't look so its better to have the rule about only in free time.  By having this rule i think it will make kids be better because if there not then they will not be ably to use there phones. That what most kids like and want to be ably to use there phone in school. Not all kids have phones so to make it far for everyone the rule should be phones and ipods only in there free time .Think this would work good as a rule but we need to try it first. In high school you can use it so why not middle school. Kids should start see how it work with the phones in high school. So they can have in idea about it. But not everyone is going to think how i do but i think we should try it for a week or two to see if it works. But think that policy number one is a good one and a good idea.  We never now if we don't try. We should try if it work we keep it if it doesn't then we just say it didn't. But we can say at least we tried. For some student it will work good but for some it wont. Some will have hard time with it but other wont. Most student do there homework when there testing and do good in there class. Maybe is not a bad idea doing this new rule about the cell phones. we should all look at this there some good things about having this rule and yes there some bad ones too. But i think this would work as a good rule for the school.		0
To Whom It May Concern:  I am writing this letter regarding your policy on cell phones during school hours. In my opinion, I believe Policy 1 is the better choice for our school. If cell phones are allowed to be used during free times and lunch, it would have a better effect on the students. As school goes on, the curriculum becomes more difficult which encourages students to study harder and focus more on getting higher grades. While their grades are very important, this may create stress on some students which may even lead them to get lower grades.  Permitting the use of students' cell phones during school could possibly reduce the stress they have from being the studious children that they are. Having less stress and pressure on them may result in higher marks and eventually an exemplary school. This could benefit the school district greatly and this policy can be spread to other schools so that all of our campuses can be exemplary.  Another reason why this cell phone policy could result in a positive outcome for our school is it could maybe even save lives. For example, if there is a fatal emergency in the cafeteria that involves choking, a student could simply dial 911 to get an ambulance there as soon as possible.  There may be some issues when first putting the policy in order, but once students get used to the idea that they are allowed to use their phones during free time only, they won't bother with sneaking any texts during class. To prevent cell phone usage during class, students should be allowed to go to their lockers after lunch to put them away while under the supervision of an administrator. This keeps them from cheating on tests, contacting anyone outside school, and being distracted in class.  I really believe this change in your school's regulation could help your students develop into a fully grade A campus and be even better than before. I am hoping for your kind consideration.		0
Venus is known as the second planet from our sun, it's sometimes called the "Evening Star" despite it wasn't a star at all. It was also referred as Earth's "twin," since Venus is the closest with density and size in terms of Earth's. But, we really don't know alot about Venus. Now why is that we don't sent any rovers, satelites, ANYTHING to get some few informations about Venus for the last three decades?  Because anything that touched the surface of Venus surrvived less than three hours. Which gathered the reputation as the as the challenging planet to study.  What is the challenges of studying Venus? Well, first of all, The atmospere of Venus has a THICK layer of carbon dioxide the covers 98% of the planet, in which makes Everything a much hoter place,but, to top it of with the atmosphere problem, the clouds in there have highly corrosive sulfuric acid. If we some how passes through the atmosphere, than we'll face ANOTHER problem with the ground. Since Venus is the second planet from our sun and with all those carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the surface ground temperature is over 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. In which with the surface and the atmosphere, it could basically melt many types of metal with no problem. Another Problem is that the atmosphereic preassure is 90x greater than our Earth, with that much preassure could easily crushed a submarine that is built to surrvive the deeper end of the ocean. From what we gather small information from our space craft, the geology of venus pretty much have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.  Despite all of the troubles and challenges that Venus caused, many of the scientists, astronomers, and including the author themself think that it's worth all of the trouble to get s much information as possible to get to know more of Venus. But WHY is it worth studying it? Well, Astronomers are fascinated and interested in the past of Venus as many of them has theorized that might've used to be a lot like Earth from long time ago, with Venus used to oceans that support life like ours. Another reasons why it's worth the trouble and money to study it is that Venus could be our next Planetery visit as our nearest option.  To me, I'd thought that it wouldn't be worth all the trouble to study more of this when we can study other planets like mars that support life better than Venus since it's surface and atmosphere wasn't as crazy as Venus'.		0
Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  Car ownership has long been synonymous with suburban life, but recent trends suggest that limiting car usage can have numerous advantages. This movement, known as "smart planning," is gaining momentum across Europe and the United States. The advantages of limiting car usage include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating more compact neighborhoods, improving accessibility to public transportation, and promoting a healthier and less stressful lifestyle.  One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, with them being the cause of 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in certain car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, we can greatly contribute to combating climate change and creating a more sustainable future.  Additionally, limiting car usage allows for the creation of more compact neighborhoods and improved accessibility to public transportation. The German suburb of Vauban serves as a prime example of a car-free community. With streets designed specifically for pedestrians and bicycles, Vauban has fostered a sense of community and reduced the dependence on cars. Similarly, other cities across the globe are adopting this approach, placing stores within walking distance and focusing on public transportation. By doing so, these communities are creating more vibrant and livable spaces.  Not only does limiting car usage benefit the environment and community planning, but it also promotes a healthier and less stressful lifestyle. The reliance on cars often leads to sedentary habits and high levels of stress. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, or public transportation, individuals can incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. This not only improves physical health but also reduces stress levels, as seen in the testimony of Heidrun Walter from Vauban, who states, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."  Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. In instances where driving is banned, like the temporary driving ban implemented in Paris due to smog, congestion is significantly reduced. This reduction in traffic congestion leads to increased productivity and efficiency. Furthermore, limiting car usage can result in cost savings for individuals, as they no longer need to bear the expenses associated with car ownership, including fuel, maintenance, and parking fees.  In recent years, there has been a shift in American behavior away from car ownership and driving. This change can have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is a major contributor to emissions. It is essential that this trend continues and is supported by policies such as promoting car-reduced communities and investing in public transportation.  In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and wide-ranging. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating more compact neighborhoods to promoting physical and mental well-being, limiting car usage has the potential to transform our communities and improve our overall quality of life. It is crucial that we embrace this movement and work towards a future that is less dependent on cars.		1
Seeking multiple opinions when making an important decision or asking for advice is beneficial for a few key reasons:  Firstly, different people will have varied perspectives, experiences, and areas of expertise that can provide unique insights. No single person can possibly have considered all angles of a complex situation. Getting input from more than one source allows you to develop a more well-rounded understanding of issues involved and factors to weigh carefully.   Secondly, multiple viewpoints help identify biases or blind spots someone may have if only consulting their own viewpoint. People naturally see things partially from their own life lens and no one is objective 100% of the time. Others can point out assumptions made or altnerative ways of thinking about things that broaden one's analysis. Catching potential blind spots early aids making the most informed choice.    Thirdly, common themes or consistent advice across opinions strengthens the likelihood of their validity over singular recommendations. If different people reach similar conclusions independently, that consensus lending should carry more weight than any one individual take. Conversely, identifying inconsistent or conflicting advice highlights areas needing further reflection before deciding.   Finally, seeking a variety of counsel empowers someone not to rely too heavily on any single source and avoid potential pitfalls of overconfidence in one person's counsel. It gives the opportunity to weigh different perspectives rationally rather than make an emotional decision based on one limited view. The multilayered insight makes it less like an individual's potential biases could sway the final choice.  In conclusion, making well-considered decisions is aided by accessing viewpoints beyond just one person. The diversity of multiple credible opinions helps gain a more well-rounded evaluation of situations from more life experiences and prevents relying too narrowly on any singular assessment. It strengthens one's ability to make the best-informed choice overall.		1
 [Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State ZIP Code] [Date]  [State Senator Name] [State Senate Address] [City, State ZIP Code]  Dear [State Senator Name],  I am writing to express my views regarding the proposed reform to the electoral college system. While some advocate for changing to popular vote, I believe that the electoral college system is crucial in choosing the president of the United States. As your constituent, I urge you to consider the importance of maintaining this system.  Firstly, the electoral college system is designed to protect the interests of smaller states. In the current system, each state has a number of electoral votes equal to the number of its Senators and Representatives in Congress, regardless of its population size. As a result, states with lower populations have more influence over the election outcome than states with larger populations. This system promotes equal representation of all states in the political process, which is essential in preserving the integrity of our democratic system.  Secondly, the electoral college system ensures that the president is elected by the entire country, not just by urban-populated areas. In a popular vote system, candidates tend to focus their campaigns in densely-populated urban areas, meaning they overlook rural areas and smaller towns. The electoral college system, on the other hand, requires candidates to campaign in all states, ensuring that the president represents the entire nation.  Thirdly, the electoral college system prevents extreme candidates from winning the election. Popular vote systems can elect candidates who only win in certain areas, but lose nationwide. This phenomenon is known as "coattail effect," where a popular candidate pulls along their less popular running mate. In contrast, the electoral college system requires candidates to appeal to voters in a variety of states, which discourages extremism.  In conclusion, the electoral college system is essential in choosing the president of the United States. It protects the interests of smaller states, ensures that the president represents the entire country, and prevents extreme candidates from winning the election. As your representative, I strongly urge you to support the maintenance of this system.  Thank you for considering my views on this matter.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Distance learning is a common type of learning¬†for some schools across the country. Students are able too be at home and still learn the same subjects they learn at school. This type of learning is very similar too online schooling, instead of never going to school and constantly studying from home, students can attend some classes through a online or video conference. Students who do distance learning, have many disadvantages when being compared too regular learning in School. The students who participate in distance learning will not benefit from it.  First, distance learning can restrict certain students ability to learn through bad internet, old computers, and low financial struggles. Firstly, students who have bad internet¬†connection can have many disadvantages, preventing students from benefiting in distance learning. Having a bad internet connection can slow you down, and could even cause a disconnection in the work you're doing. For example, at School the internet connection would be very weak for some students during the day, it would cause students too disconnect from the application while the rest of the class are working together. Secondly, students with old computers can have the same affect as slow internet but with even more disadvantages. Old computers can cause applications too glitch, making the venerability of getting viruses higher, and it could even cause newly made files non compatible¬†when you try to run or download the file. The older the computer, the higher chance of problems too occur. Lastly, some students don't have the same financial struggles as other students. The low budget they have on purchasing supplies such as computers, laptops, and monitors can affect the way they study from home. Not being able too purchase certain supplies or latest models can have a heavy effect on the way students learn from home. At school, students with financial problems are placed in a special program too help them purchase the supplies they need at school for a low price or even for free. When these particular students try to participate in distance learning, they cannot appropriately¬†participate in it. This makes basic learning at school a better decision for financial struggling students. Concluding, students with learning disadvantages do not benefit from distance learning.  Second, Distance Learning can be an easy way too cheat on given assignments through using notes that are not permitted on test day and searching up or sharing answers for an assignment. Firstly, students have the ability too cheat by using information handed to them in class, such as notes on tests. Cheating can lower your ability too learn, making Distance Learning non beneficial for students. For example, when students are given notes for a class, it is either saved online or physically placed in their folder. Students at home, doing distance learning usually have parents at work and don't have anyone at home to supervise over them. This setting allows students too cheat on tests and other important assignments by pulling out their notes and using it on tests. Secondly, students can also cheat by searching up or sharing answers for their homework and classwork. Sharing answers with classmates too complete an assignment lowers the creativity and effort put in, making distance learning less beneficial for students. For example, students can send messages to each other during class and get answers for certain questions too complete their assignment. In conclusion, Distant Learning is an easy way for students too cheat on assignments from home lowering the benefits of taking the program.  Others may find Distance Learning beneficial since it helps bullied students and those who struggle too find friends. Going to school has many benefits too it, such as building your friendliness, personality, and awareness too different cultures. First, Students who are friendly learn how too talk to other people at school. Second, building a personalty helps students be unique in a group of people allowing others to find him interesting too communicate with. Lastly, being knowledgeable of the different cultures that surround you builds your awareness of the different perspectives, people see.  Concluding, Distance Learning is not beneficial¬†since all the ability students have an opportunity too misuse it for their advantage. Students who participate in Distance Learning can easily cheat on many of the assignments. Not only can they lack in effort too complete their assignment and still get a good grade, but having a disadvantage when learning, such as not having the supplies needed in order¬†to complete an assignment can affect the benefits you get when working at home. Therefore, Distance Learning is not at all beneficial when compared too regular school learning.¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
Working alone or in a group has been a topic of debate for many years. While some people believe that working in a group is more beneficial, others argue that working alone is more effective. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of working alone rather than in a group.  One of the main benefits of working alone is that it allows for more focused concentration. When working alone, you have complete control over your work environment and can work at your own pace without being disturbed by others. This can lead to a more efficient and effective work process, as you can focus on the task at hand without any distractions.  Another benefit of working alone is that it allows for more personalized learning. When working in a group, you may feel like you are being forced to conform to the pace and learning style of others. However, when working alone, you can tailor your learning to your own needs and pace. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the material and a more personalized approach to learning.  Working alone can also lead to greater creativity and innovation. When working in a group, you may feel like your ideas are being stifled by the opinions of others. However, when working alone, you have the freedom to explore your own ideas and be creative without fear of judgment. This can lead to more innovative and original solutions to problems.  Finally, working alone can lead to greater success. When working in a group, you may feel like you are being held back by the performance of others. However, when working alone, you have complete control over your own success. This can lead to greater motivation and a greater sense of accomplishment when you achieve your goals.  In conclusion, working alone has many benefits that cannot be overlooked. It allows for more focused concentration, personalized learning, greater creativity and innovation, and greater success. While working in a group has its own benefits, working alone can be just as effective and even more beneficial in certain situations. As an eighth-grade student, I believe that it is important to have a balance between working alone and in a group, depending on the task at hand.		1
Sports and extracurricular activities are very common in today's schools, yet in recent years the number of students who participate in these has diminished.¬†One of the few top causes are, technology, lack of drive, and higher levels of stress.¬†Therefore I feel, that students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity to, aid in finding peers with similar interest, be stress beneficial, and drive students with the enticement of competition.  First and foremost, this will aid in finding peers with similar interest because, we are more often than not, on social media or are on our phones more intrigued in what somebody else is doing, or where they are going than what we are doing with their own lives.¬†A prime example of this, is that people won't sign up for something they don't like.¬†So people in chess club most likely want to be there, that is something everyone there has in common.¬†Plus if we participate in multiple clubs or activities and the same people are in them to, they probably have similar interest that could lead to companionship.¬†With this added benefit of friendship it opens a whole new door of opportunities for us.¬†It means that we can have someone there for support or someone to go hangout with in the future.¬†It can also drive us to take more risk in our life and open us to new opportunities like a new food or activity that we may enjoy.  Secondly, a lot of students, especially in late middle to high school, are under a exponential amount of stress.¬†This can cause them to do are think about harmful or life threatening activities to them or others.¬†To prevent this, it would be wise for us to be in a place where we can express ourselves and let off some steam. Extracurricular activities fulfill this need for relief in our lives, and A few of the ways it does this is exposure to the community by, travel, community service, or self influence in the community.¬†Another benefit is time management, many students, my self included, struggle with time management because we are constantly over run by massive a amount of knowledge from the day or week, so that leads us to give to much or little time to self benefit.¬†This leads to higher levels of stress when we don't have time to do anything on the spot.¬†I have first hand experience with this where just the other day I came home after a long and dreadful day where I was to tired to do anything so I simply fell asleep even though I had plans to go with my friends that evening, but was famished of energy from school.  Lastly, it opens up a window of opportunity when it comes to competition.¬†As human beings we strive to be the best in life. We want to have, the style, the smarts, and the popularity in life.¬†With that said, clubs and sports allow for that through competition.¬†For some they get to express their leadership skills, for others they get to home in on their teamwork skills and on the very rare occasion it teaches some to be humble with loss.¬†Competition gives a sense of unity with each other because everyone is working toward the same goal, winning, and it can also build confidence though leadership.¬†A good example is a sport coach, in some sports one of the players is actually the coach, and having that job is often a way to build confidence because it gives a sense of power to them.¬†Even losing can help them, for some they feel that winning is the only thing in life so they get all worked up about it. So when they lose and understand that its not a bad thing. It helps them learn not to be so stressed about winning, and I used to be that way, but because I learned that I can lose and it won't kill me, I have enjoyed life more.  In conclusion, I feel that having us participate in a extracurricular activity is a highly beneficial idea that will allow for us to enjoy life with a higher acceptance. It will let us make more friends with similar interest, allow for us to be less stressed in life, and give us a higher sense of confidence in life. All of this leads to the fact of enjoying life to the fullest and sharing that with others instead of being secluded and stressed in life which is where a lot of the student population is right now in comparison to a couple of decades ago.		0
 Dear Senator [Name],  As a concerned citizen of this great nation, I would like to voice my opinion on the electoral college system used in the United States. After conducting thorough research, I strongly believe that the electoral college system works and should remain in place. In this essay, I will provide evidence from various sources to support my claim that the electoral college is essential for fair representation of the American people.  Firstly, the electoral college system provides a check and balance against the potential tyranny of the majority. This is exemplified by the situation during the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Despite Al Gore winning the popular vote, George W. Bush ultimately became the president. The electoral college system allowed for Bush to win the election, even though Gore had a narrow lead in the popular vote. This ensured that the voice of the minority was heard and prevented one candidate from dominating the outcome.  Secondly, the electoral college system is a more democratic way of electing the president. In a popular vote system, a candidate could win the presidency by winning just a few heavily populated states and losing the majority of the country. This would not accurately represent the will of the people as a whole. The electoral college system, on the other hand, requires a candidate to win a majority of states across the country, giving a more representative voice to the American people.  Finally, the electoral college system allows for a more diverse range of candidates to be considered for the presidency. In a popular vote system, candidates may focus on winning populated areas, neglecting other states. This would not allow for a candidate to bring their unique perspective and ideas to the presidency. The electoral college system, however, requires candidates to appeal to voters across the country, bringing attention to issues that affect all Americans.  In conclusion, the electoral college system is an essential part of the American democratic process. It provides a check and balance against the potential tyranny of the majority, is a more democratic way of electing the president, and allows for a more diverse range of candidates to be considered for the presidency. I urge you to consider the importance of the electoral college system and vote to keep it in place.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
Did you ever thought about doing some of extracurricular activities after school and how they impact you and your community? Well,I agree that students must praticipate in at least one extracurricular activity because it's fun,it helps your community,and you can get service hours.  My first reason is fun. Do you know that feeling when you have nothing to do and then you get bored? Some activities like sport or things that you enjoy to do outside of the school are solution of this problem. If you really enjoy your activity,it will keep you away from being bored. Also,it is a great way to get some skills and improve yourself. On other hand,it is fun because of the other people. Imagine a student that never does activities outside of the school sits at home and does nothing and a student that communicates with many people and meets new people during the activity. I think that the person who has a extracurricular activity has more social skills that will be useful in the future and is never bored.  My second reason is,it helps community. For example,I have an activity outside of the school. It is Russian scouts. We meet up at church in Washington D.C and we talk about how we can help our community and environment. Sometimes we pick up the trash or give away food for homeless and people who needs it. Sometimes we visit old people and help them. Also,we donate some of our collected money for many things. So,I think it's a very good way to help your community by doing kind things like that. Activities like that make a really great impact on you and your community.  My third reason is service hours. All teenagers understand how it is important. For example,if you do extracurricular activity like serve on the student council or like me,be in organization that helps community you can get service hours. They are really important for high school and college. This is why activities like these may help you a lot. I have an expirience of getting eight service hours by helping my Unity time teacher Mrs. Generic_Name with decoration of the Snow Ball dance after school and also I got 6 service hours by helping Russian Scouts with Russian Festival in Washington D.C.  In conclusion,I think extracurricular activities do impact you and your community in a good way. That's why I agree that students must praticipate in at least one extracurricular activity because it's fun,it helps your community,and you can get service hours. What are some impacts of your activities? Do you think extracurricular activities are something that student must do?		0
Is distance learning such as, online learning or video conferencing more benefical than traditional learning?. In my opinion, I believe that most students that take online classes have a higher risk of failing. Therefore, they have a higher change of getting distracted. Studies confirmed that young adults are more likely to get distracted than adults since, their minds are not fully develop. I also believe that, every human being has a different way of learning and goes on their own pace.  There is positive's and negaitive's reasons about person-to-person learning and online learning. Person-to-Person learning helps the students gain more knowledge and interaction. While being in a traditional classes, you can ask questions anytime and gain a relationship with one another. The negaitives of tradtional learning is that, students attend to skip class, not listen to the teacher, and sleep during teaching. Students attend to do these negative actions because they might be force to go to school or they can not go on their own pace.  Online classes are not benefical but you can go on your own pace. Another reason is that, techonolgy is popular in this generation that students rather be in a device. Online classes have a positive side to them because there is many options online in what you want to learn about, but keep in mind that visual is harder than interacting. Visual is diffcult to understand because there is no instuctor or a teacher helping you in person. I believe that everybody is different and we all learn in different ways and different pace.  Some Students would not be able to attend at home classes because of personal problems such as, not having food to feed themselves, some do not have a roof over their heads, or they do not have access to a device. For an example, there are some students at Generic_School that do not have food at their home and all they eat is school lunch. It hurts to see Children that are not able to afford things in life that are in need such as, education. Education is in all of our life's and I hope traditional schools can still be popular as online schools. In this generation techonology is taking over students!.  In conclusion, I support my reasons and my opinions about, traditional learning is a better way to learn than online learning. They both have Pros and Cons but Traditional learning has been in our lives for so many years and techonology and devices are taking over students. Distraction is what young adults have trouble with, Online classes is not a great idea to pursued. There are many reasons and studies, why students should keep attending traditional schools. I also believe everyone works and learns in their own pace and that is why Person-to-person is way to pursued.   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
 Driverless cars are becoming an increasingly popular topic in the automotive industry. There are many reasons why these cars are becoming more popular. For one, they have the potential to greatly reduce the number of accidents caused on the road. In 2018, there were over 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States alone. This is a very high number, and many experts believe that driverless cars could significantly reduce this number.  Another reason why driverless cars are becoming so popular is that they could greatly improve traffic flow. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can be very expensive in terms of lost productivity and wasted fuel. By using advanced algorithms to control the movement of vehicles, driverless cars could help to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow.  Driverless cars could also provide a new level of convenience for commuters. Many people spend a significant amount of time driving to and from work, and this can be very frustrating. By using driverless cars, commuters could simply sit back and relax while the car takes care of the driving. This could save a lot of time and reduce stress.  Of course, there are also some concerns about driverless cars. One concern is that they could be very expensive to develop and purchase. This is not necessarily true, however. As more of these cars are built and sold, the cost of production will likely decrease. Additionally, some people worry that driverless cars could lead to job losses in the automotive industry. While this is a valid concern, it is also important to remember that driverless cars could create new jobs in areas such as software development and maintenance.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to greatly improve safety, traffic, and convenience on the road. While there are some concerns about these cars, the benefits are well worth considering. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that driverless cars will become a more and more common sight on the road.		1
 Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are a topic of intense debate and discussion in the field of transportation. With advancements in technology and artificial intelligence, it is becoming increasingly possible for cars to operate without human intervention. In this essay, we will explore the benefits and drawbacks of driverless cars, as well as their potential impact on society.  One of the most significant advantages of driverless cars is the increased safety they would bring to the road. Human error is a leading cause of accidents, and driverless cars, with their advanced sensors and computer algorithms, would be able to identify and respond to potential hazards more quickly and accurately than a human driver. This would significantly reduce the number of accidents on the road, saving countless lives.  Another advantage of driverless cars is their potential to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. With their ability to communicate with each other and with traffic lights, driverless cars could help to optimize the flow of traffic, reducing the number of cars stuck in traffic and the amount of time commuters spend sitting in their cars. This would also reduce fuel consumption and emissions, leading to a more sustainable transportation system.  However, there are also some potential drawbacks to driverless cars. One concern is the impact of such technology on the job market. As driverless cars become more common, many jobs in the transportation industry, such as taxi drivers, truck drivers, and bus drivers, could become obsolete. While some jobs may be replaced by new positions related to the maintenance and operation of driverless cars, there is still a risk of significant job losses.  Another concern is the potential for driverless cars to be hacked or manipulated for malicious purposes. As with any technology, there is always a risk of cyber-attacks, and driverless cars could be particularly vulnerable if not properly secured. This is a serious concern that will need to be addressed by automakers and regulators to ensure the safety and security of these vehicles.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry, bringing increased safety and efficiency to the roads. While there are some concerns about the potential impact on the job market and the security of these vehicles, the overall benefits of driverless cars make them a promising technology for the future. As with any new technology, it will be important to address these concerns and ensure that the implementation of driverless cars is safe, secure, and beneficial for everyone.		1
While encouraging student involvement is a noble goal, mandating participation limits personal choice and freedom. There are better ways to foster engagement that respect individual interests and circumstances.   Not all extracurricular activities suit each student's strengths, schedule or priorities. For some, family or work responsibilities may preclude taking on additional commitments. Others benefit most from independent study or downtime to recharge. A one-size-fits-all approach risks alienating those who feel unable or un inclined to comply.     Rather than requiring involvement, schools could promote opportunities in a variety of formats. Highlighting ways different clubs and sports cultivate skills like teamwork, leadership and time management may appeal to some. Allowing students to try several options before committing lets them find their best fit. Recognizing academic and service-based extracurriculars equally also broadens the definition of contribution.  Leaders could empower student voices by gathering input on desired new activities or how to better support participation. Peer mentoring, activity fairs, designated club finding periods and incentives like academic credit broaden access. With multiple easily accessible on-ramps, most students will likely find ways to engage that enrich their high school experience and skills on their own terms.   Forcing involvement may boost numbers in the short term but risks exacerbating stress levels and minimiz ing long term benefits. By cultivating choice, ownership and community, schools can foster enrichment for all students through extracurriculars without compromising individual freedom or well-being. Overall engagement and benefits to student development will flourish most with flexibility, accessibility and student-centered support rather than top-down mandates.		1

The Face on Mars has been a popular icon of space, and evidence in arguements for the reality of ancient alien civilazations on mars. The Face on Mars is a natural landform similar to many on earth, like mesa's common in areas like the nevada desert or the grand canyon. Nasa has taken photos of the land form whe never they have been able to get a good shot of it, which is not very often.  Skeptics were far from convinced by the 1998 photos, many of them claimed that NASA had chosen to take the picture during a cloudy period of Mars' year to cover up an ancient alien artifact, or possible markings. Skeptics did not realise that NASA would benifit monumentaly from the discovery of an ancient alien monument on the surface of mars. In 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor again was close enough to catch a pitcure of the Face on Mars, the picture spanned a total of 1.56 meters compared to the Viking's 43 meters per pixel photo, The Surveyors photo revealed simply a landform similar to that of a mesa of butte.  The Face on Mars has been a populars icon for many things in the past, and has been used time and time again for debates on ancient alien civilazations on Mars. The iconic Face on Mars was a subject that was only important to the taxpayers not some scientific marvel or long lost ancient technology. In reality the Face on Mars is simply a land form like any other on the red planet, not an ancient alien artifact or monument.    		0
In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This movement is based on the belief that cars are harmful to the environment, unhealthy for individuals, and inefficient in terms of time and money. There are many advantages to limiting car usage, and these advantages should be considered by all citizens.  One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is that it is good for the environment. Cars produce a significant amount of pollution, which contributes to climate change and other environmental problems. When people limit their car usage, they are helping to reduce pollution and protect the environment.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it is good for personal health. Cars are a major source of sedentary behavior, which can lead to obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. When people walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving, they are getting more exercise and reducing their risk of developing chronic diseases.  Finally, limiting car usage is efficient in terms of time and money. Cars are often slow and expensive to operate, especially in urban areas with heavy traffic. When people walk, bike, or take public transportation, they can save time and money.  In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car usage. These advantages should be considered by all citizens who are concerned about the environment, personal health, and efficient use of time and money.  In addition to the advantages mentioned above, limiting car usage can also improve public health by reducing air pollution and noise levels. It can also promote social interaction and community building by encouraging people to walk, bike, or take public transportation together. And it can help to create more livable, walkable cities that are more enjoyable to live in.  Of course, there are also some challenges associated with limiting car usage. One challenge is that it can be difficult to make changes to our habits and routines. Another challenge is that many cities are not designed to be easily walkable or bikeable. But these challenges can be overcome with planning and effort.  Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage far outweigh the challenges. If we are serious about protecting the environment, improving our health, and creating more livable cities, we need to make a concerted effort to reduce our reliance on cars.		1

Driveless Cars are a great impact in the world and it can change the lives of others , also. Driveless cars are cars that can drive by it self without having help with a driver. Well, in certain occations. It depends on the condtions that are happening in the streets. For instance, backing up out of your drive way or trying to avoid a object in the street but that is all simple things drivers can do with their cars. In the article, "Driverless cars Are Coming", the author states alot of negative and positive things about driverless cars. However, Driverless cars are a positive aspect. In addition, these cars can help and impact many peoples lives. Going for driverless cars can change the way people drive and will make it easier for the drivers to drive.  Driverless cars can change the way how we see cars now, change the way of drving, and how it makes it easier for the drivers to drive in the streets. For instance, " The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheel and reduce power fro the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could ever manage alone",(p.5). Driveless cars have more potential in driving than humans do. They are more aware in whats going on in the streets than humans do drving on the streets. To add, they have better responses dealing with danger, such as, people crossing the street unexpectedly or cars turning out of nowhere whe there suppose to do so. Another example is, " The can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, suuch as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over whe the situation requires",(p.7). Driverless cars have all the basic fundamentals in order to drive on the streets. In fact, they notify humans when they need help in certain situations. This car idea will help drivers pay more aware whats going on even though the car can drive by itself. This is like helping a baby to walk. The parent lets go as the baby starts to walk. Trying to catch its balance and the baby falls. The parent is aware that the baby falls and the parent picks the bay back up to continue on walking. Nothing is wrong will a little help even if the Driverless car is struggling to go around something or backing up for it to drive independently. The driver is aware and alerted and will guide the car to its direction and the driverless car will continue driving to where you want to go. There is always going to be problems with driverless cars. However it can make your life much easier, espcially, driving wise. The examples explain that driverless cars can have its ups and down but it will make people's lives much easier. These cars will help people become safer and alerted to whats going on around them and in result, there would be less car accidents  In summary, driverless cars can change the world deeply and will make it a saver place on the streets. It will make it easier for the drivers. Futhermore, driverless cars are more smarter, driving wise, when on the road than the drivers. That would create less stupidity of driving and more of boat smarts.        		0
As an average 8th grade student, I believe that technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, and it's essential to analyze the potential risks associated with its use. While technology has made communication, learning, and entertainment more accessible, it also poses several dangers that can negatively impact our well-being.  One of the most significant risks of technology is addiction. With the constant availability of smartphones, tablets, and other devices, many people, especially children, find themselves spending hours on end scrolling through social media or playing games. This excessive screen time can lead to a decrease in physical activity, poor sleep quality, and a decrease in face-to-face interactions. According to a study by the American Academy of Pediatrics, excessive screen time can also lead to an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems.  Another risk of technology is the loss of physical sight. With the rise of smartphones and other digital devices, many people are spending more time looking at screens and less time engaging in outdoor activities. This can lead to a decrease in visual acuity, eye strain, and other vision problems. Additionally, excessive screen time can also lead to a decrease in physical fitness, which can further exacerbate vision problems.  Furthermore, technology can also impact communication skills. With the rise of social media and messaging apps, many people are relying more on digital communication and less on face-to-face interactions. This can lead to a decrease in verbal communication skills, empathy, and social skills. According to a study by the University of Michigan, children who spend more time on digital devices have lower levels of social skills and empathy compared to those who spend more time engaging in face-to-face interactions.  Lastly, technology can also have a negative impact on our children's development. Exposure to inappropriate content, cyberbullying, and online predators are all potential dangers that parents should be aware of. According to a study by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, one in five children have been exposed to inappropriate content online, and one in seven have been victims of cyberbullying.  To limit these risks, parents can		1
Some schools across America are offering an opportunity for students to attend classes from home via video conferences. In an age where technology is becoming more advanced and playing a large role in everyday life, should schools take advantage of this and allows students to take online classes from home. It would be benefical to the studnets and teachers as well. Students should take online classes because it allows students to learn at their own pace, it is similar to taking a test on computers and has been proven to be reliable, and it allows the student to learn wherever or whenever they want.  Starting off, each and every student is different from their other peers; those students also work and learn at a different pace. In a classroom, the teacher has to give out information in a timely manner to follow the ciriculum; this may leave to students ,who work at a slower pace, behind. While yes, the student can ask questions during a lesson, it will slow the rest of the class down. Having online classes, however, allows the same students who work at a slow pace to learn and be on the same page as their other peers. Having a video conference will also allow the student to work at their own pace, as they will have direct contact with the teacher.  In addition, having an online class is very similar, if not the same as watching a video and then taking a quiz on what was learned. This same form of test taking has been done by most, if not, all school across the country. Having the option to take online classes will be the same as taking a test, except the teacher is in contact with the student over video call. It will also retain the student's attention; students who are in skilled in technology will most likely pay attention because techonolgy is involved with the method in which they're learning. It also eliminates the need for teachers to grade many papers; the classes will be done online, which means neither the student or the teacher will have to worry about assignments being graded late or correctly because the test program will grade the work for them.  Finally, the student can be anywhere and still be up to speed with their class. It is impossible for every single student to be at school on time or present everyday; some get sick or have plans made with family. For a school that requires students to learn in a clasroom, this means the student will miss out on a day of school. Which means they will have to make up that work and run into issues if they do not know the material. However, if online classes were an option for students, they won't have to miss anything that is being caught to the rest of the class. Most students have access to some form of techonolgy, whether it be a cell phone, a tablet, or a laptop. If they're sick in bed or if they're in a car on a family trip, they can go to the video conference for their respective classes and learn the same material and minimize the workload on themselves.  As technology moves foward, education should move forward with it. The ability for student to attend online classes from home should be offered in all schools. Students would be able to work at their own pace. It would also be familiar to the student, as it will be the same as taking an online test . And finally, it also the student to be anywhere, and still be able to learn what the rest of the class is learning. The education of a student is vital to their development; the option to have online classes will make them just as, if not more successful then they would be if they were in a class room environment.   ¬†		0
"Making Mona Lisa Smile" article introduces us to a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. It is a technology that allows computers to recognize and identify human emotions. The article discusses the benefits of this technology in different fields. However, I would like to argue whether the use of this technology is valuable in the classroom to read the emotional expressions of students.  The use of the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom may provide several benefits. Firstly, it can help teachers identify when a student is struggling with a particular topic in class. When the computer identifies a student's facial expression as one of confusion or frustration, the teacher can then provide additional support or explanation. Secondly, it can also help in identifying when a student is experiencing bullying or any other emotional distress. This technology can help teachers to provide emotional support to students who need it.  On the other hand, the Facial Action Coding System may not always be accurate, and it may lead to false assumptions about a student's emotional state. For example, a student could be smiling while thinking about something completely unrelated to the class, and the technology may interpret this as a positive emotional state, which could lead to incorrect conclusions by the teacher.  Furthermore, this technology could also violate a student's privacy rights. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing that their facial expressions are being analyzed and recorded by computers in the classroom. This may also lead to a lack of trust between the students and the teacher, which could have negative consequences on the learning experience.  In conclusion, while the Facial Action Coding System has some potential benefits in the classroom, there are also concerns about its accuracy and potential privacy violations. Therefore, before implementing this technology in the classroom, schools need to conduct thorough research on its effectiveness and consider the ethical implications. It is essential to strike the right balance between the benefits and potential drawbacks of using this technology.		1
 As American jazz legend Duke Ellington once said, "A Problem is a change for you to do your best." I believe that this statement holds true because when faced with a problem, it presents an opportunity for us to rise above and achieve our full potential. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. In many instances, adults tend to give up too easily when facing challenges, rather than putting forth their best effort.  One example of this can be seen in sports. When athletes are losing a game, they are often highly motivated to give their best and try to turn things around. However, when adults face problems outside of sports, they may not have the same level of motivation to put forth their best effort. This can lead to missed opportunities and a lack of progress.  For instance, my friend recently lost her job and was feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about her future. Instead of giving up and accepting her situation, she decided to take action and try to find a new job. She spent time networking, updating her resume, and applying to various positions. While it was a challenging process, she eventually landed a new job that she loves.  This experience taught my friend the importance of always striving to do her best, even when faced with adversity. She realized that giving up too easily could have led to a missed opportunity for growth and success.  In conclusion, Duke Ellington's statement, "A Problem is a change for you to do your best," is a powerful reminder to always put forth our best effort, no matter what challenges we may face. Whether it's in sports, at work, or in our personal lives, we should never give up and should always strive to do our best.		1
STUDENT_NAME  OTHER_NAME  OTHER_NAME  3-3-11  I don't think that is a right thing to do on our benefit because we try. We as children or teens do our best hoping that you will accept it... but our best is not enough? students have a grade C and cant participate in school activities I don't think that's a way to run a elementary school. I don't think the school policy should change.  If students don't have daily activities like sports and things how do you expect them to be physical and active during class. With out activities how are students going to stay in shape. their are more reasons to support this. Like students cant have physical education and they cant have any sports team. What parent would want to send their child to a school like that.  The students need time that's all. The principal of the school needs to have patience with the students of that school. If you were to give it some time then maybe the grades will go up even higher then expected. Children of our age group work at their own paste so give them a chance. Don't take away the school activities and the grades will get better.  In conclusion, it is not the right thing to do if you decide to take it away. Different school are getting better because of patience. Also some schools are getting worse because teachers and principals are being hard on the students. Don't take the activities away it would work in the beginning but in the end it will be a mess.		0
You should join the Seagoing Cowboys. It is a very fun program that helps the people of Europe. It is an nice adventure.  This is about helping the people who were affected by World War ll and having an adventure. It is sponsered by the UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Admistration). Luke's experience was the best one.  I feel that Luke did get the point of this program, because he talked a lot about traveling and helping. Of course it's alot of work, but it is also fun and you can see new places. Here is one statement that luke stated, "  I had the side benifit of seeing China. Luke was the one Seagoing Cowboy that had made nine trips. That was because he had such a great experience, and you would too if you join this program.  If you join the Seagoing Cowboy program you won't regret it.  Here are some of the benifits that you get, if you are an animal lover you get to work with animals like horses and cows.

They also play baseball and vollyball. Come and join the Seagoing Cowbays you would love it there!   		0
Are students given enough freedom in school classrooms? Students attend school for approximately 180 days each school year. However, the work does not stop just because summer break begins. Teachers often assign specific projects to students at the end of each school year for them to complete by the time they go back to school in the fall. These projects can include reading a book, writing an essay, or completing worksheets. While some may argue that summer projects should be student-designed because it gives them more freedom, it is best for teachers to design these projects because they know what will benefit students the most and it is less inconvenient for teachers and students.  Teachers only assign students work that they know will benefit the students. Students may view summer projects as useless, extra work, but teachers always have reasons for assigning assignments. Many teachers' reasons for assigning summer projects is to prepare students for the following school-year. A vast majority of schools offer advanced placement courses which are very challenging and rigorous classes. In order to give students an introduction to what the class is like, teachers often assign summer projects. This helps the students in the long-run because they are given exposure to the course ahead of time.  Having student-designed projects is too much of a hassle for teachers and students. Adopting student-designed projects would require each individual student to brainstorm ideas for their summer project. Not only does it take even more time out of students' summer lives, but it also creates more work for teachers. If each student were to design their own project, teachers would have to grade each project using a different set of eyes. Each project would be unique, meaning teachers would not be able to use the same set of standards for all projects. Without having a standard list of requirement, students would not know if their project met the requirements and it would take teachers forever to grade the projects. Having one uniform assignment for all students would relieve much stress from teachers' and students' lives.  Some may argue that student-designed projects give students more freedom. Each student is creative in their own way and some may say that students are not given enough opportunities to utilize their creativity in school. Allowing students to design their summer projects¬†would make it more enjoyable while also still learning. However, students do not always do things that are in their best interest. Instead, they take the easy-way-out.  Overall, it is in everyone's best interest to have teacher-designed summer projects. It creates less stress for teachers, and it prepares students for the next school year. Students are given freedom in the classroom in many other ways, and adding student-designed projects would make classrooms even less structured. Teacher-designed projects are beneficial to both teachers and students, and they should be used in all classrooms.		0
Schools are not only about learning math, English, science and history. Schools are also about learning how to interact with other people, and if a student does not attend school they will be behind those who do. I think online classes would not benefit students in the social aspect of life and in performance in academics.  During anyone's time in school whether it is a private school or a public school they encounter other students which helps develop social skills which are important to survive in the real world. The online schooling would not only make those who take it feel like their alone but it will make their adult life far more difficult. In the real world, future adults will have contact with a lot of people and students who had an interaction with other students will have an easier time doing so in their adult life. Unlike kids who spent their time in a room all by themselves learning, they will have to adapt to having interactions with other people. For example if a student who took the online classes in a future job had to present something for his boss, the student would have a difficult time getting his point across to other people because of the missing interaction with other people during their developmental years. Now if a student who attended school with other people did this it would be much easier for them because they would know how to talk to others and get their point across.  Another reason is that some kids learn better with others. Sure there may be the usual kid that does not want to be around other people but there's not many of them. For example my friends and I enjoy coming to school because we see each other¬†and also because it has a sense of competition in terms of who has the better grades. I think when other kids are around and doing better than you it makes you want to try harder. Second if a student you sat next to in math class or in history was doing better than you in your mind you would say, oh i want to be like that, making you want to try harder and ultimately do better in school. In any competition teams push themselves to the limit, whether its a race, the final of a championship game or the last play in the game, teams try their hardest because the other team is doing so as well. Students will do that too, but they need other students to compete with which would not happen in online school.  The last reason why online schooling from home would not benefit a student is because they will simply skip the class. No matter who you are, you have your lazy moments. You have those moments where you just don't want to do anything, these moments usually happen at the comfort of your own home. Times like this are easily avoided by attending school, the student wakes up in the morning gets ready, walks to their bus stop and off they go to school. A student who has class at home may or may not forget about their class or even worse know they have it and decide not to do it because they are at home. There is no choice in whether you will go to school today or not, most of the time it's a yes, your parents say you have to go to school and that is what you have to do. Online classes can be avoided if the student just does not do it. Students are supervised in school at all times whether its administration during lunch, or by a teacher in class. Who is going to supervise the student at home? if a parent is home they might do it but if there is no parent it's up to the student to make that decision and its usually a I am too tired to do this.  Online school may be only fit for a certain amount of students. For example students who work or live too far from a school may be able to benefit from doing it, but the majority of kids would not. Online school has its wins but it is also very faulty. It can be easily be avoided by lazy students, it can have a big impact in the future of the student and it can have an change performance in a bad way. Therefore most students will not benefit from online school and it will slow them down.		0
Dear Principal,  I believe that the 1st policy of letting them have phones at school for free time and lunch periods is better because if you don't let them have them in school there could emergency phone calls or text messages that they need to use them for. The policy of letting them have phones at school for free time and lunch periods but turning them off in the class time is better in a lot of ways, i think having them off during class periods is good so they do not become a problem for teachers and students. But also for free time I think they are fine because students can use them for emergencies and problems if they have any.  The 2nd policy is not good at all for students because if they absolutely need to use the phones they will not be able to use them for problems and family or friend issues. I like using my cell phone but during school it is off all day so i do not get in trouble, in some cases, no, they should not be used but yes, a little bit of the time i believe they are acceptable. The only problem with you letting us have phones i school is that kids will text in class and use them for reasons they should not be used for during school hours. (texting, calling). The only reason they should be used is for calculators and during free time, music if you have music on it.  When students are using their phones they need to be supervised by teacher or counselor, principal, etc. cell phones are useful in some cases but they should not let them get out of hand. I understand that teachers get to use their cell phones but they normally use them for reasons of calling home making parental contacts and emergencies with their family or with a student.  Me, myself just think that when cell phones should be used it should be announced by the teacher that is a time to use them and when the time is not good for them to use the phones. Cell phones can be very troublesome to some kids but my opinion is that you should stick with your first policy because it could and probably would be good for everyone.      		0
The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" doesn't support the idea of studying Venus well as it lacks with detail, and they don't go in depth with the pros of exploring this inhabitated plant and how it would benifit us in doing so.  In the article we are introduced to Venus and given a glimpse of our background history with them. The author also includes infromation of the planet's atmosphere and how it's a challenging factor for us when attempting to reach its suface, the huge difference that seperates us from them. When given information of past travels, we are informed that "Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades," (TCEV). With this alone there is already doubt engendered in the reader's mind because of how long it has been since we last attempted to reach such grounds and how even then spacecrafts weren't durable when they did make it. "Each previous mission was unmanned" due to the circumstances they were met with yet when further reading is made we are told that NASA wants to send humans to Venus. This only adds to the concerns of the reader in manifesting alien-like areas.  Then we are explained of possible ways NASA is already planning to approach Venus and how they are already working, or at least contemplaiting, ways to last longer in Earth's 'Twin Sister'. We are given a jot down of how things are being tested and what it is they are trying to overcome in order to create something durable that will hold longer than a few hours. The only reason we are given for this is that "Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system," (TCEV). The author doesn't even clarify how this is impactful to our society today. What is there to gain from a planet that "may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system?" In that sentence alone there is still some uneasiness since it's not sure or confirmed that Venus was once like Earth.  Therefore, this is why the author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" doesn't support the idea of studying Venus very clearly. The lack of pros and benifits to our planet adding to the pot of cons and uncertainty that was instead made from reading this article. Surely they did a splendid job in guiding us through possible ways that'll help in exploring the harsh environments and listing final encounters we have had before, but no information was straightforward when it came as to why we should invest time in going to Venus when such dangerous challenges are in front of us.		0
Generic_Name  Are take home projects for students over summer vacation necessary? Yes, students should be given some sort of summer project that corresponds with their class for the following year. students spend roughly eight months in school and once summer comes all the academic knowledge they acquired over the school year is lost the day they walk out the school doors. students should stay in some sort of school environment so they do not fall behind or lose as much prior knowledge about the subject. students could connect with their teachers for the next academic school year and receive their project from them, to turn in the first week of school.  Many students need the extra summer project to keep them in the flow of things. Some students don't need the extra project they are always in a school mindset and keep there grades up. However, that is not the case for every individual student. A summer project would be no ones favorite summer activity but, it would benefit students for their next academic school year. therefore, students would already be in school mode and be more prepared and less likely to fail a semester due to lack of knowledge.  Students should be able to come up with their own creative idea whether it be for a science project or an English essay. Student would be more prone to do their work if they could do their own topic. Students would do topics that they are interested in, maybe a sport they play or the history of a vehicle they like. But, when students receive a prompt or a project of any kind they are not as interested as they could be if it was their own topic. The topics could be submitted to the students teachers to be approved prior to summer and starting the work.  It is necessary for students to receive a take home project or essay over the summer. It will keep students on their feet and in a school like environment. It will also build responsibility, and let your teachers know how dedicated you are to school or how important it is to you. Students would also have something to do over the summer, because most students sit around at home and do nothing but play video games and watch television. So yes, schools should send home summer projects and the students should be able to make a creative topic with his or her teachers approval.		0
I'm going to be talking about how phones can be used for. I'm going to talk about people driving. If it's okay to drive and use phones or it should not be a good idea. Phones and driving are good at times but not in the same time. Phones are good for emergency calls or for help.  Using a phone is dangers when driving. Someone can lose control of the car when driving. Someone can get hurt by using the phone while driving. Someone can lose site from the road because that person decided to use their phone. Using the phone can get that person stopped by the police.  When using a phone while driving can cause an accident. Someone can run over a person for using a phone. Someone can hit a car while using a phone while driving. Someone uses a phone while driving and runs a red light and hit a car. Someone can run a stop sign and hits a kid.  When driving and using a phone can get someone killed. Someone can fall off a cliff while driving and using a phone. Someone can flip over and lose their life while driving and using their phones. Someone can be going fast because they were using their phone and wasn't paying attention and hits a car and dies. Someone pays attention to their phone and runs over an animal and dies.  To conclude my essay driving while using a phone should not be allowed. Drivers should pay more attention on the road. Safe driver will not us a phone while driving. Reckless driver can cause an accident. People should not drive and text because someone can get hurt.        		0
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:   Failure: A Lesson Learned   Failure is something that we all experience at some point in our lives. It's inevitable, but it's how we respond to it that truly matters. Last year, I experienced a situation where I failed to overcome a challenge, and it had a significant impact on both myself and a friend.   The situation was during a school project where we had to work in groups to create a presentation. My group and I were assigned to create a presentation on a historical event, and we were given a month to complete it. However, we kept procrastinating and didn't start working on it until a week before the presentation was due. We were all busy with other activities, and we didn't hold ourselves accountable for our lack of progress. As a result, we didn't have enough time to finish the presentation, and we ended up turning in a poorly researched and poorly presented project.   Looking back, I realize that I could have done several things differently to avoid this situation. Firstly, I could have taken the initiative to start working on the project earlier and held my group members accountable for their lack of progress. Secondly, I could have communicated better with my group members and made sure that everyone was on the same page. Finally, I could have sought help from our teacher or a tutor if we were struggling with the project.   The impact of failing to take these actions was significant. Not only did we receive a low grade on the project, but we also missed an opportunity to learn about an important historical event. Additionally, my friend who was relying on me to do my part of the project was also affected. He had put a lot of trust in me, and when we didn't do well on the project, he felt let down.   In conclusion, failure is a valuable lesson that teaches us what not to do in the future. By reflecting on our mistakes and taking action to correct them, we can overcome failure and achieve success. Although I failed to take the necessary actions to complete the project, I have learned from this experience and will make sure to do better in the future.		1
Sure, here's my essay:  Physical exercise is super important for our health and well-being. It can help us stay healthy, feel good, and even do better in school! When we exercise, our bodies get stronger and more fit, which can help us play sports and do other activities without getting tired as easily. Exercise can also help us control our weight and feel more confident in our bodies.  But did you know that exercise can also help us in other ways? It can make us feel happier and more relaxed, and it can even help us sleep better at night! Exercise can also help us learn new things and do better in school by improving our focus and concentration. And if we exercise with our friends, it can help us make new friends and strengthen our relationships with the people we already know.  Thomas Jefferson was really smart when he said, "determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." I think he was trying to say that if we always keep busy and do things, we can achieve a lot of great things in life. And I agree! When I'm not idle, I feel like I can do anything. I can finish my homework, play sports, and even help my family with chores. It makes me feel good and proud of myself.  Personally, I've found that not being idle has had a huge impact on my life. When I'm busy, I feel more energized and motivated. I'm able to focus better in school and do better on my tests. And I'm also able to help out more around the house, which makes my family happy. Plus, I have more time to hang out with my friends and do fun things together.  But it's not just about the things we can do when we're not idle. Exercise and being busy can also affect our relationships and self-development. When we're active and engaged, we're more likely to make new friends and build stronger relationships with the people around us. And as we get older, we can use exercise and being busy to develop new skills and interests, which can help us find our passion and purpose in life.  So, in conclusion, physical exercise and being busy are super important for our health and well-be		1
A four-day work week with ten-hour days could have a significant impact on students with part-time jobs. If this change is implemented, they will need to adjust their schedules accordingly, which can be difficult as schools typically offer courses Monday through Friday. For energy and resource conservation, having four days with ten hours could be beneficial compared to five days with eight hours. Although there could be potential advantages to a four-day workweek, some drawbacks should also be considered. Student fatigue could be an issue as classes would be longer and more intense, and some students might have difficulty managing their courses, work, and personal obligations with the added hours. Furthermore, some jobs may not be available on weekends and could cause disruptions in students' finances if their usual work day off is changed.		1
I believe that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment because they create a positive learning atmosphere. When students dress in a professional manner, it helps them focus on their studies and behave appropriately. It also helps reduce distractions and peer pressure related to fashion and style.  For example, when students wear uniforms, it eliminates the competition and pressure to wear trendy or expensive clothing. Students are less likely to be bullied or teased for their appearance, and they can concentrate on their studies without worrying about their clothing choices.  Another benefit of dress codes is that they promote a sense of unity and equality among students. Everyone wears the same outfit, regardless of their socioeconomic status, race, or ethnicity. This helps students feel included and valued, and it reduces social divisions and tensions.  Furthermore, dress codes can prepare students for the real world, where they will need to dress appropriately for work or other professional settings. By learning to dress professionally at a young age, students are better prepared for future success.  In conclusion, dress codes are beneficial to the school environment because they create a positive learning atmosphere, promote unity and equality, and prepare students for the future. Therefore, schools should consider implementing dress codes to improve the overall school experience for all students.		1
  Dear [State Senator],  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I believe it is still an essential part of our democratic process.  One of the primary arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a more accurate reflection of the popular vote. As Bradford Plumer notes in his article "The Indefensible Electoral College," the winner of the popular vote has only lost the presidency five times since 1824. This is due to the fact that the Electoral College system awards electoral votes based on the number of representatives each state has in Congress, rather than the total population of the state. This means that smaller states have a disproportionate amount of influence in the election, which can lead to a more representative outcome.  Another argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign in a wider range of states. As Judge Richard A. Posner notes in his article "In Defense of the Electoral College," the winner-take-all system used in most states means that candidates have a strong incentive to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This leads to a more engaged electorate in those states and ensures that the President-elect has a broad base of support across the country.  However, there are also counterarguments against the Electoral College. One of the most common criticisms is that it can lead to a candidate winning the presidency without receiving the most popular votes. This is exactly what happened in the 2000 election, when George W. Bush won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to Al Gore. This can be seen as undemocratic and unfair to voters who supported		1
 Car-free cities are cities where cars are not allowed to operate within their boundaries. These cities are gaining popularity all over the world, and the idea behind them is to promote a healthier and sustainable way of living. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of car-free cities and discuss some examples of cities that have already embraced this concept.  One of the main benefits of car-free cities is that they reduce traffic congestion. With cars off the roads, the streets become more pedestrian-friendly, allowing people to walk, bike, or use public transportation to get around. This not only improves the quality of life for residents but also reduces the number of accidents caused by cars on the road.  Another benefit of car-free cities is that they promote a healthier lifestyle. By encouraging people to walk, bike, or use public transportation, car-free cities reduce the amount of time people spend sitting in their cars, which has been linked to numerous health problems, including obesity and heart disease. Additionally, walking and biking are great forms of exercise that can help people stay fit and healthy.  Car-free cities are also more environmentally friendly than traditional cities where cars are a primary mode of transportation. Cars are a significant source of pollution, and by eliminating them from the streets, car-free cities can greatly reduce their carbon footprint. This also frees up more space for green spaces and public art, creating more beautiful and livable communities.  There are several cities around the world that have already embraced the concept of being car-free. One such city is Amsterdam, which is famous for its bike culture. The city has a well-maintained network of bike paths that make it easy for people to commute to work or school by bike. While there are still some cars in the city, the streets are predominantly pedestrian and bike-friendly.  Another example of a car-free city is Copenhagen, Denmark. The city has implemented a number of measures to reduce car usage, including a congestion charge for driving in the city center and a bike-powered train that connects the city to its suburbs. These measures have been successful in reducing car usage and promoting a more sustainable way of living.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer numerous benefits, including reducing traffic congestion, promoting a healthier lifestyle, and being more environmentally friendly. These cities are a great example of how communities can come together to create a more sustainable and livable future. While car-free cities are not yet widespread, it is important that we continue to explore ways to reduce our reliance on cars and promote more sustainable forms of transportation.		1
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student responding to the prompt:  Winston Churchill once said, "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." I think this quote is really important because it shows that success and failure are both a part of life, and it's how we react to them that matters.  I think failure is actually really important in the pursuit of success. When we fail, we learn what doesn't work and can try again. If we never failed, we wouldn't know what doesn't work and we wouldn't be able to improve. For example, if I wanted to learn how to play the guitar, I might try and try again until I got it right. If I never failed, I might never figure out how to play it correctly.  Enthusiasm is also really important when it comes to learning from mistakes. When we're enthusiastic about something, we're more likely to keep trying and not give up. If we're not enthusiastic, we might get discouraged and give up too easily. For example, if I'm working on a project for school and I make a mistake, I try to stay enthusiastic and keep going because I know that I can learn from my mistake and do better next time.  Another important thing to remember is that it's okay to make mistakes and try again. If we're afraid to try new things or make mistakes, we'll never learn or grow. For example, if I wanted to learn how to cook, I might try making a new recipe and if it doesn't turn out right, I'll try again until I get it right.  Learning from the failures of others is also really important. When we see how someone else failed and how they overcame it, we can learn from their experience and avoid making the same mistake. For example, if I was learning how to play a sport and my teammate made a mistake, I could learn from their mistake and avoid making the same one.  In conclusion, I think it's good to fail sometimes because it helps us learn and grow. It's how we react to failure that matters, and if we stay enthusiastic and keep trying		1
Michelangelo, a famous artist, once said, "I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free." This statement highlights the importance of setting high expectations and working towards achieving them. However, it is also important to understand the implications of falling short of these expectations. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the benefits of setting high goals versus low goals, and explain why setting high goals requires confidence, challenges, and pride.  Setting high goals can have numerous benefits. For one, it can help individuals push themselves to achieve more than they thought possible. When people set high goals, they are forced to work harder and be more disciplined in order to achieve them. This can lead to personal growth and development, as individuals learn to overcome challenges and obstacles. Additionally, setting high goals can help individuals build confidence and self-esteem. When people achieve their goals, they feel a sense of accomplishment and pride, which can boost their confidence and motivate them to continue setting and achieving high goals in the future.  On the other hand, setting low goals can have negative consequences. When people set low goals, they may become complacent and lazy, not pushing themselves to achieve more. This can lead to a lack of personal growth and development, as individuals are not challenged to reach their full potential. Additionally, setting low goals can lead to a lack of confidence and self-esteem, as individuals may not feel a sense of accomplishment when they achieve their goals.  It is important to note that setting high goals requires confidence, challenges, and pride. Confidence is necessary in order to believe in one's ability to achieve their goals. Challenges are necessary in order to push individuals out of their comfort zones and force them to grow. Pride is necessary in order to feel a sense of accomplishment when goals are achieved.  While it is important to set high goals, it is also important to understand that not all goals will be achieved. However, even when goals are not achieved, there can be positive effects. For one, individuals can learn from their failures and use that knowledge to improve in the future. Additionally, individuals can still feel a sense of pride and accomplishment for the effort they put into achieving their goals, even if they were not able to achieve them.  In conclusion, setting high goals can have numerous benefits, including personal growth, development, and confidence. However, it is		1
  Dear [State Senator's Name],  As a concerned citizen and student of politics, I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I believe it is still a crucial part of our democratic system and should be kept or changed to election by popular vote.  One of the most significant arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner notes in "In Defense of the Electoral College," a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but less likely than a dispute over the popular vote (Posner, 2004). This is particularly important in a country as diverse as the United States, where a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. By requiring a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that the president will have the support of the entire country.  Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it induces presidential candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, where the election is closest. As Bradford Plumer argues in "The Indefensible Electoral College," this leads to more thoughtful voters in those states, as they know their vote will decide the election (Plumer, 2004). In contrast, a popular vote system would likely lead to candidates ignoring smaller states and focusing solely on the largest ones.  Moreover, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. As Posner notes, a victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral		1
Dear principal, i believe that not letting students participate in sports if they do not have at least a B average is wrong. when i was in volleyball my 7th grade year it was the last game and i was failing science i was very disappointed to hear that i could participate because of my grades. Students look forward to playing in sports and participating , some students do not have the best grades but they succeed in sports. Sports are where you can be your self and do something your good at and you love doing it.  Students have trouble focusing and paying attention because there not doing something there good at , some students may do really good in some subjects but then really bad in another. I don't think that students should be punished because they don't understand how to do something which is making them fail.  Parents want to see there kid succeed and be able to say " my kid is on the football or volleyball team." I don't have the best grades in the world but who does , that shouldn't be a reason for students not enjoying what they love to do and are good at it. punishing students based on there knowledge is wrong and unfair.  So i think you should rethink your idea and think to yourself what if i was one of the students that couldn't participate in the volleyball, football, or basketball game .		0
American citizens know that the cars driven throughout America is polluting the air. Not just the cars in U.S but cars all around the world. Residents on Vauban in Germany, Paris, Bogota and even the USA cars are reduced from bieng driven or they had been banned to reduce the pollution from the air. They dont want to turn out like China, which is know as one of the most polluted cities in the word. Cars been a very help, but it looks like the end of car culture beacuse less cars that are bieng used less pollution we are causing to the Earth, which mean its better of with out them.  Vauban, a women named Heidrun Walter said, "when i had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way". There for one of the advantages of limiting car usage is that losing tense about a car. Also in Vauban,street parking, driveways and home garages generally are forbidden. That mean it take less space for parking, past two decades there was an effort in making cities denser, and better for walking now they can if they limite the usage of cars. It lower emissions and improves saftey, These are some advantages of limiting car usage.  Almost 4,000 drivers were fine, according to Reuters in Paris. They been fine beacuse Paris had banned driving due to smog. Trying to fix the problem to clear the air of the global city they ordered to leave thier cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Less cars mean less warmer climants beacuse cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Benfits would come from less car usage. Now in Bogota there is a car-free day, when u leave cars at home and you cant use them for a whole day. For that day there isn't any traffic because all of the residents are hiking, biking, skating or taking the bus to work. This car-free day reduce smog and if any person violats that day they are going to be fine $25. They said its a good way to take away stress and lower pollution. Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic.  President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United states' greenhouse gas emission, unveild last week. Recent studies suggest that the Americans are buying fewer cars. They are driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The love of vehicles seems to be cooling. Population growth,the number of miles driven in the Untied States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter. Car ownership per household and per person started to come down.    		0
The first thing im gonna talk about is in the store it sayed they took there right to drive away and fined them if they do drive that is stupid. If u pay for that car or truck and pay for the the gas that they sale you should be able to drive that car or truck wherever u want to. And if they new it was gonna cause harm to the environment then why did they do it i mean that's pretty dumb. They new that them hazardous gasses and fumes were gonna mess things up so why would they do it.  But u have to have these vehicles and semis to be able to transport goods from place to place do i mean your really just gonna have to deal with it cause u have to have them cause whose gonna hall all that stuff by hand one by one nobody and its just a waste of time cause u would kill yourself trying to do it so why not just use a semi that uses left over stuff from gas that way there not dumping all that stuff out on the ground ans its not going down and pouluting our water let it puluote our air but if we don't have that water we couldnt go 3 days and we could were gas masks if it come down to it its really not that big of a deal.  There making this how smog thing a big deal they can come up with something to help that or go away that is just so stupid that they do that cause they can prevent some of it with safe idle and emmisind but they dont want to hold to there laws ad people that are doing it they just let them go on like there doing and they do nothing about. Why would they do wat they are doing and not help us out and quit taking our rights away.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    		0
 The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could have both benefits and drawbacks.   One potential benefit is that it may help teachers better understand how their students are responding to lessons. If the technology can detect when students appear confused, bored, or frustrated, it could provide valuable feedback to teachers on how to improve their instruction. By recognizing when concepts are difficult to grasp or parts of lessons lose students' interest, teachers may be able to adapt their teaching methods or spending more time on challenging topics. This could enhance the learning experience for students.  However, there are also some valid concerns about the widespread use of this technology in classrooms. Using computers to monitor students' facial expressions and emotions throughout the day may invade their privacy and feel like excessive surveillance. Students should feel comfortable naturally expressing a range of emotions at school without constant monitoring of their facial reactions. Additionally, facial expressions do not always accurately convey a person's true feelings. There are many factors like personality, culture, mental state, etc. that influence one's expressions. So relying too heavily on these scans could result in misinterpretations of students' emotional and cognitive engagement.   Overall, while FACS technology shows promise as a tool to provide teachers feedback, more safeguards would need to be in place to avoid overuse or improper interpretation of students' expressions if used extensively in classrooms. A balanced approach that only occasionally scans small, anonymous sample groups may help address privacy and accuracy concerns while still gaining insights for educators. But constant emotional surveillance of all students risks negatively impacting the learning environment. With guidelines around its appropriate implementation, this technology could potentially benefit the classroom experience. But more research is needed to fully understand its pros and cons.		1
Ummm... hey there!  So, like, I totally think that students should have the right to choose their own elective classes, you know? It's like, super important for us to have some say in what we learn and stuff. I mean, who knows better than us what we're interested in and what we want to learn more about?   I know some people might be like, "But what about the teachers? They put in so much work to teach us these classes!" And yeah, that's totally true. But here's the thing... if we're not interested in the class, we're not gonna pay attention or learn anything. And that's a waste of time for both us and the teacher, right?   Like, I know some people who are super into math and science, but they hate art. So, why should they have to take art if they're not gonna enjoy it? They could be using that time to learn something they're actually interested in. And the same goes for the teachers. They could be teaching something they're passionate about, instead of something they don't really care about.   Plus, when we get to choose our own electives, we can explore our interests and figure out what we want to do when we grow up. Maybe we'll discover a new passion or talent that we never knew we had!  And that's, like, super important for our future.  So, yeah. I think students should have the right to choose their own elective classes. It's not fair to force us to take classes we don't want to take, and it's not efficient for us to learn stuff we're not interested in.  Makes total sense, right?		1
 The face on Mars: a debate over mythology and reality  For centuries, humans have been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe. Among these mysteries, none has captured the imagination quite like the face on Mars. This enigmatic feature has been the subject of much speculation, with some claiming it to be a product of intelligent life on the planet while others dismissing it as nothing more than a natural phenomenon.  The face on Mars first appeared to be visible from Earth in the 1970s, during the mission of the Mariner 9 spacecraft. The spacecraft's orbit allowed it to capture images of the planet's surface, and these images revealed a striking pattern of light and dark that seemed to form the shape of a human face. At first, the discovery was met with skepticism, with many scientists dismissing it as a product of natural forces.  However, the face on Mars continued to be visible even after the Mariner 9 mission, and subsequent spacecraft has captured even more detailed images of it. In recent years, the image has become more clearly visible and has even been observed to move, giving rise to the idea that it may be a product of intelligent life on the planet.  The debate over the face on Mars has been fueled by the fact that no definitive evidence has yet been found to either support or dismiss the theory that it is a product of intelligent life. On one hand, those who believe in the existence of alien life see the face on Mars as strong evidence for this theory. On the other hand, those who dismiss the possibility of life on the planet argue that the face is too simple to be the product of intelligent beings, and likely the result of natural forces.  In general, the face on Mars is still largely a mystery, and it is likely to remain so for many years to come. However, the debate over its origins continues to be a fascinating conversation, with each side presenting its own evidence and arguments in the quest to understand this enigmatic feature of the universe.  One thing is certain, however: as long as humans are fascinated by the mysteries of the universe, the face on Mars will continue to captivate our imaginations. Whether it is the result of natural forces or intelligent life, the possibility of life beyond our own planet will always be a source of wonder and inspiration to explore.		1
Luke in the story A Cowboy Who road waves is a Young Adult who had just got out of high school. Luke was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and in a bank. Don his friend had invited him to go to Europe in a cattle boat. Luke did not give this opportunity up.  UNRRA also known as the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administation hired the "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas.  The Seagoing Cowboys had recieved their orders to repot to New Orleans. They had arived August fourteenth. When they got the seaman's papers they boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed for Greece. Their cargo was full of 335 horses plus tons of hay and oats to feed them.  Luke had been given a great opportunity for a small-town boy. It took the Seagoing Cowboys two weeks to get acroos the the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke kept busy by feeding and treating the animals on the cattle boat.  And at the end Luke says that he is grateful for the opportunity that he had to get on and ride that cattle boat. This concludes to my opinion that you don't have to always be someone special to get good things.		0
 Once there was a cowboy, a man who loved the freedom of the wild west and the thrill of the ride. But this cowboy was different from the rest. He had a passion for the ocean and the waves that rode on it.  Growing up along the coast, he spent many hours watching the waves crash against the shore. He would often dream of riding them, of feeling the rush of water beneath him as he soared through the air. As he grew older, he knew that he had to make this dream a reality.  So, he set out to become a cowboy who rode the waves. He spent years learning the art of surfing and bodyboarding, perfecting his skills on the waves. He rode the waves like a pro, catching them with just the right amount of speed and skill.  But being a cowboy who rode the waves was not just about the thrill of the ride. It was also about the mindset of the cowboy, about facing life's challenges head-on and never backing down. Whether the waves were big and rough or small and calm, the cowboy rode them with the same passion and determination.  As he rode the waves, he felt a sense of freedom and excitement that he had never experienced before. The ocean was his playground, and he loved every moment he spent on it. But he knew that the waves were not just about the ride. They were also about the journey, about the adventure of exploring the depths of the ocean.  The cowboy who rode the waves was a unique individual, a man who had found his true calling in life. He loved the ocean and everything it had to offer, from the thrill of the ride to the beauty of the underwater world. To him, he was not just a cowboy who roamed the wild west, he was a man who had found his true purpose in life.		1
 The electoral college is a group of electors appointed by the political parties in each state who ultimately determine who will become the President of the United States. While the system has been in place since the founding of the country, there has been much debate in recent years about its effectiveness and whether it should be abolished. In my opinion, the electoral college does work, but there are some improvements that could be made to the system.  One of the main arguments for the electoral college is that it ensures that the president is elected by the entire country, not just by a few large cities or states. This means that smaller, more rural states have an equal say in the election, which is important for maintaining a balanced representation of the country's diverse regions and interests. Additionally, the electoral college provides a check on the power of political parties and special interest groups, who may try to dominate the election process in certain regions.  However, there are some flaws in the current system. For example, in some cases, a candidate may not win the popular vote but still win the election because they have won enough electoral votes in key swing states. This can lead to a candidate ignore certain regions of the country or focus too heavily on certain demographics, which is not good for the unity of the country.  To address this issue, one possibility is to implement a national popular vote system. Under this system, the candidate who wins the popular vote nationwide would be elected as President, regardless of how many electoral votes they receive. This would ensure that the president is truly elected by the entire country and would eliminate the need for candidates to ignore certain regions or focus too heavily on certain demographics.  In conclusion, the electoral college does work as intended, but there are some improvements that could be made to the system. It is important that any changes made to the electoral college are done carefully and with consideration for the country's diverse regions and interests. Ultimately, the goal should be to ensure that the president is elected by the entire country and that the electoral college remains an effective and representative system.		1
Senator,  The Electoral Eollege seems highly unfair to the people. The winner, may not even be the majority vote. Perhaps a president received a majority of the votes, but the people then have to rely on electors to vote for them. That vote may not be what the people really wanted.  When it is time for elections, small states have a disadvantage on having a big part in the president's election. A president may win over five smaller states, and yet the other could win over California and still have more electoral votes. Larger states get more attention than smaller states. This is unfair. Some voters feel trapped because they know their vote won't effect the state ruling. Voters lose incentive.  Voters in presidential elections tend to want to be heard and feel as if their vote matters so they can express their political preferences. With electoral college votes, they feel the vote is unfair and they are relying on a few people and hoping they vote for the voters candidate. The people feel as if it's kind of like gmabling. In swing states, people have an advantage there. The "winner-take-all" method induces the candidates to pay more attention to those states. The candidates will campaign there more often and gain more and more attention from the swing state voters. Other states do not like this because they get less attention and the votes in swing states are more thoughtful than one-sided states.  The Electoral College votes, seem not-so-democtratic. It is the electors who actually end up electing the president...not the people. Anyways, this       ¬†    		0
Over the summer some schools require students to complete a summer project. These projects do help students academically but, you tend to see the best results when the projects are teacher designed. Teachers have a¬†better insight on the curriculum rather than a new student who knows very little or anything about the curriculum. Therefore, summer projects must be teacher designed so that students can have guidelines, accurate grading systems, and work that will help them prepare for the upcoming school year.  First and foremost, students need guidelines when it comes to doing any kind of project. If you do not show a student how to accurately do something they may turn in their work and it could be the complete opposite of what the teacher wanted done. For example, a teacher's summer project could be to write about your summer experience and include pictures. With no guidelines, a student turns in a two sentence essay and a picture composed of one stick figure. But if that student was told to include six paragraphs and pictures taken from a camera, then the results would be different. Although, one may say that guidelines provide the student with a lack of creativeness there may be a student who does not have a creative mind. In this case not only will the guidelines help that student, but they will provide the student with a plan on how to properly complete the project.  To add, teachers must design summer projects so that students can have a accurate grading system. If students were to design summer assignments, the teacher is limited to grading on simple things such as completion, creativity, or even neatness. For example, a student could spend hours working on a summer project. The student completes a neat project but it has nothing to do with the class curriculum. Since the project is student based, the teacher is now forced to give a superior grade for something that does not correspond to the curriculum. One can argue by saying that having a strict grading system causes students to stress over school work during their summer break. But, the summer assignments along with the teachers grading system could prepare students for how the actual class will be once school starts. This will cause less stress during the actual school year because students will prepared and know what is expected of them.  Last but not least, students need to have a teacher designed summer assignments so they can be well prepared for the upcoming school year. Teachers know the curriculum and grading system before students arrive. So the teacher could help by assigning a project that corresponds to what topic they will be covering first. For example, a teacher is starting off the school year by teaching division. The summer assignment is to find out the definition of division and write about three times you had to divide something. The students feel more confident going into class knowing the have insight on the first topic at hand. To argue one could say that students may have a easier time completing a project they designed. But overall the purpose of the summer assignment is to help with the learning process. Which is why it is more efficient to have teacher designed summer assignments because they know the upcoming curriculum.  To conclude, teacher designed summer assignments make for a better academic outcome. Students will excel¬†when they have specific guidelines to follow. They will not struggle with the classes grading system. Most importantly students will feel more than prepared coming to class on the first day. Student designed projects may help the creative side of the students. But overall teacher designed projects will help with everything the student needs to be successful.¬†		0
Lowering our car usage will be beneficial for all of us, the advantages of doing this will be huge, and will help the enviroment. Lately a lot of studies have revealed that one of the most eviroment-harming actions are the emissions that cars release into the atmosphere. If we lower our car usage we will help the enviroment of the planet we are living in, it only seems logical to do so.  One of the reasons lowering car usage would be helpful is beacause it would significantly lower gas emissions from cars. This would greatly help our enviroment. According to the text, "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.". This shows how harmful this emissions are, and why we should try to lower them.  Lowering our car usage and creating car-free suburbs or car-reduced communities would help our daily life. Driving a car every day can be stressful because of trafic and road rage.  lowering our car usage would help people relieve stress and even get some excercise. According to the text, "When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way". This shows how stress-relieving reducing car usage could be.  Also lowering car usage could be a way for the goverment to create more bicycle paths. This would be really helpful to the people who only have a bicycle as a way of transportation. According to the text,"The day without cars is part of an improvement campaing tha began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"  There are some people that do not agree with this idea, most of them say that it would hurt the car industry. Of course it will, but this is for a greater good. So let's reduce our car usage and help our enviroment.       ¬†    		0
There have only been a few spacecrafts sent to Venus but none of them lasted long scientist are trying to figure out how to get a spacecraft to hover over the surface. The reason is to collect samples from there and then be able to make it back or have enough time to send the information the spacecraft got, back to NASA.  For example " Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcaneos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface". We are having trouble getting the data back because the spacecraft it is getting destroyed.  It may be very expensive to attempt to get to Venus but it could give us some good insight on what we can research and study back at Earth. The stuff we find on Venus could be benefical to us going to different planets and exploring different parts of the Solar System.  In conclusion we shouldn't let money be a factor on if we get a spacecraft to Venus we just have to figure out how to safely get there and be able to gather the data from the spacecraft. If we do find something we will most likely go back and try to find more of it or more helpful resources. 		0
 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) refers to a method used to record and categorize human facial expressions and movements. It is a comprehensive system that can be used for a variety of purposes, including communication studies, psychology, and even artificial intelligence. In this essay, we will explore the history of the FACS system, its components, and how it works.  The FACS system was first developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in 1978. According to the authors, the system was created to identify and analyze the fine motor skills that control facial muscles. Their goal was to develop a standardized system that would allow researchers to study facial expressions and movements in a consistent and objective manner.  The FACS system consists of six action units, which are specific facial muscle groups that can move independently of one another. These units include the vertical frontalis, oblique nasalis, lateral frontalis, vertical nasalis, oblique orbicularis, and lip curler. By combining these units together, a wide variety of facial expressions and movements can be created.  The FACS system works by coding the individual facial actions that occur during a given expression or movement. This process involves identifying the specific muscle groups involved and assigning a numerical code to each one. The codes are then used to analyze the expression or movement, providing valuable insights into the underlying muscle contractions and their functions.  One of the key benefits of the FACS system is its ability to provide a highly detailed analysis of facial expressions and movements. For example, it can be used to identify subtle differences between expressions that may go unnoticed by the naked eye. This level of detail can be beneficial in a variety of contexts, including communication studies, where the FACS system can be used to analyze nonverbal communication in real-time.  The FACS system has also been used in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. By studying how emotional expressions and facial movements are coded and analyzed, AI researchers have been able to develop systems that can accurately detect and interpret facial expressions, leading to more realistic and intuitive interactions with humans.  In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is a powerful tool for studying facial expressions and movements. By providing a standardized and objective method for coding facial action, it allows researchers to analyze facial expressions and movements in a highly detailed and accurate manner. Whether used for communication studies, psychology, or artificial intelligence, the FACS system offers valuable insights into the underlying muscle contractions that control our faces.		1
Dear Senator of Florida, I believe the electoral college should be abolished as a process over all. The electoral college should be abolished because it does not benefit the U.S. in anyway and has caused multiple problems in elections over the past years. The electoral college should not be a part of the U.S. Constitution and it only causes issues while elections are present therefore we as a country should elect by popular vote.  The electoral college should be abloshied because it has caused multiple problems over the past years during elections and could continue to cause problems. The electoral college process consists of selecting electors, as you know, but those electors do not always vote for their parties candidates like they should. This process causes the popular vote to not always guarantee presidency to a certain candidate even if they have the popular vote. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote but lost presidency because of the electoral college. Not only did one incident occur but multiple occur because of the electoral college. As stated in paragraph 11 of Bradford plumber's article, in 1960 segregationists in louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy so if Kennedy got the popular vote he wouldnt have got the presidency. Like Bradford Plumer clearly stated "the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational." The electoral college should be abolished so that problems can be eliminated and elections are fair.  The electoral college should not only be abolished, or destroyed, because it causes problems but also because it does not benefit the United States in any way. The outdated, unfair system just hurts the U.S. government and the country as a whole, it does not benefit our government or citizens in anyway what so ever. Under the electoral college system voters are voting for a slate of electors who don't always vote for their own party candidate rather than voting for the candidate they want to govern our country. 60% of voters would prefer direct election and popular vote anyway so why not throw out the old worn down process that docent work and replace it with something the people of this country actually want, popular vote. Some people might say we should keep the electoral college because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee so nothing can happen but according to history things can happen such as in the 2000 election. Why keep a process that the majority of the citizens of this country don't want and a process that just causes issues.  The electoral college is a thing of the past, a has been that almost no one wants around. Popular vote elections would be more fair and will not have mistakes during elections like the huge mistakes the electoral college system has proven to display. The citizens of America want the electoral college gone and popular vote elections should be what the government is aiming for so we do not have mistakes in our elections and so the U.S. can benefit from actually having a working election process.		0
Dear, Principal  You should require for all kids to help out on cleaning the school.  The results for the actions of my fellow student's would be that ,  Our school would be cleaner and then everyone would be proud that they had some part into making the school a better place.  Some Kid's might refuse to help out if so then there should be a consequence. And so we don't have conflicts with a group of kids doing more work than other's and would feel used because they did most of the work while other people did part. There Should be a limit on how many pieces of trash or how much space you should clean up, how much time you should help a teacher out. This should not be during school, it would waste your learning time although after school would be good because you wont be disturbing anyone. If it's okay with the parents of the child then we should have community service for the school. Make this after school community service for us kids fun so we wont be bored and feel like if its not out responsibility to clean up and help out. For Example You Should Help out to and the deans, give us free dress day's as our reward i guarantee it will make a difference. We Should also re-paint parts of the school that have been tagged up or written on so it can look clean and not as bad as it is.

In today's world, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. From smartphones to computers and smart homes, we rely on technology to connect with others, access information, and even perform basic tasks. However, despite the many benefits of technology, it also has negative impacts on society and the new generations.  One of the most significant negative impacts of technology is the loss of opportunities for interaction with other people. With the rise of social media and messaging apps, people are increasingly relying on digital communication rather than face-to-face interactions. While this can be convenient, it can also lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. People may miss out on the social skills and emotional intelligence that come from interacting with others in person.  Another negative impact of technology is the risk posed by scams and viruses on personal information. With the increasing amount of personal information being shared online, people are more vulnerable to identity theft and other forms of cybercrime. This can have serious consequences, including financial loss and damage to one's reputation.  Finally, technology has made people become lazier. With the ability to automate many tasks and perform them from the comfort of one's own home, people are increasingly relying on technology to do the work for them. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a lack of physical activity, which can have negative impacts on one's health and well-being.  In conclusion, while technology has brought many benefits to society, it also has negative impacts that cannot be ignored. It is important for individuals to be aware of these impacts and take steps to mitigate them. This may include limiting screen time, being cautious when sharing personal information online, and taking steps to stay active and engaged with others in person. By doing so, we can ensure that technology continues to be a positive force in our lives and the lives of future generations.		1
Dear Senator,   I am writing to you today to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to selecting the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed with the intention of giving smaller states more influence in elections, I believe the popular vote system would be a more democratic process that better reflects the will of all American citizens.  One argument often made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it discourages candidates from only campaigning in a few highly populated areas. However, this claim does not seem to hold up based on current campaign strategies. In recent elections, candidates have tended to focus most of their campaigning and resources on a handful of swing states that could vote either way. This means that states without competitive races are often ignored. A popular vote would encourage candidates to campaign across the entire country and work to appeal to a broader range of voters rather than just undecided voters in swing states.   It could also be argued that the popular vote risks candidates winning with only a small plurality rather than a majority. However, several alternatives exist that could address this issue while still selecting the president based on nationwide votes. Ranked choice voting, for example, allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives an outright majority, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes would be eliminated and their votes redistributed based on voters' second choices. This system could help produce a candidate with broader support.  Most importantly, using the popular vote would mean that every American's vote would be equal and count the same regardless of what state they live in. Under the current system, candidates can win the presidency despite losing the nationwide popular vote because of the distribution of votes among states. This undermines the principle of one person, one vote that is central to our democracy. While the concerns that led to the creation of the Electoral College remain, I believe alternative systems exist today that could address these issues while better aligning presidential elections with the overall will of citizens across the United States. For these reasons, I ask that you support changing to a popular vote system for electing the president.  Thank you for your consideration. Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Sincerely, [Your name]		1
Not everyone has the luxury of owning a car. But cars are not the only means that can get us from point A to point B. In fact, having limited usage of cars is an advantage to society, our own good, and also the environment. In the twentyfirst century, it may seem that possessing a car is a vital aspect of living, however, that is not always the case.  To began with, having a limited amount of cars on the roads means a less amount of car emission that stays in the air. Carbon emissions from cars are responsible from around 50% of the greenhouse gases in the United States alone Source 1. If we were to limit our car usage, it is very likely for that percentage to go down. Taking the account that cars are the second most item that pollutes the air, it would be a dramatic change for the environment to be a cleaner and heathier place to live Source 4.  Additionally, if we were to use our cars less and relied on public transportation, we would be able to help the economy. Using individual cars does not help anyone economically. In the other had, riding subways, buses, taxis, and other public transportation will allow the public economy to rise, which in turn allows the government to receive extra money that could benefit the local city. Taking the decision to not use cars promotes alternative ways to get to the final destination in mind Source 3. It also lets parks to be used more often than before and sidewalks become wider and safer. Moreover, the less cars that are on the street, the less traffic jams, car crashes, and time that is wasted sitting in a car wishing to be somewhere else Source 3.  furthermore, if more people were to walk or bike on the side walks, they would be able to enjoy the natural nature that they cannot fully appreciate when they are zooming pass it in their cars at fifty miles per hour. Also, getting the chance to actaully look at what the local city has to offer helps little businesses to become successful. Not using cars can also be included in our daily excersise that we are all supposed to be doing. Instead of being lazy and using cars to take us to places, we can all use that extra mile or so to help improve our health. Getting out in the open and getting some fresh air will also be beneficial to one's health by alleviating them from bad thoughts and "it is a good opportunity to take away stress" Source 3. Getting away from the busy life that includes cars is extremely advantageous to humans' health and the city they live in.  Much has changed throughout history. Nothing ever stays the same, so maybe it's the time to change the amount of car usage. This era is a time period where there are many technological inovations that allow humans from all across the world to stay in touch without leaving their couch. There has been a noticeable decrease in the amount of miles that have been driven since 2005 Source 4. This is a positive step foward to a better future for the generations to come for less cars on the road means there wil be less pollutions entering the atomsphere, more opportunities for businesses, and incouraging individuals to make healthier choices.		0
 In my opinion, it is true that we accomplish more when we are constantly doing something. This is because it allows us to learn and improve our skills. We can also teach others in the same way, by showing them how to do things that they may not feel comfortable with, but with time and practice, they will become more confident and experienced.  One of the ways we can learn new things is by helping others. For example, if we see someone struggling with a task, we can offer our assistance and guidance. This not only helps them improve their skills, but it also allows us to learn from them. Additionally, by helping others, we can also teach them new things and help them grow.  I believe that learning new things is important in our lives. It can help us expand our knowledge and improve our skills, which can be beneficial in many different ways. For example, if there is a new way to do something that we are interested in, such as learning a new language or playing a new game, we should take the time to learn it. Even if it may seem difficult at first, the benefits of learning new things can outweigh any initial challenges.  Another way to learn new things is by working together with others. When we collaborate on a project, we can pool our knowledge and skills to accomplish more than we could on our own. This not only helps us learn new things, but it also allows us to build stronger relationships with others.  In conclusion, I believe that constantly doing something and learning new things is important in our lives. It allows us to improve our skills, expand our knowledge, and help others. By taking the time to learn new things and work with others, we can accomplish more and make a positive impact on the world.		1
The face seen on Mars is just a landform and we have proof. Most people think that it is an alien built machine but they would be wrong. It is just a messa. Using the evolution of technology and cameras we have taken multiple pictures to prove what it is. Here I will explain what we did to take pictures of this mysterious thing.. We will also explain why people believed us to be wrong.  In 1976 the Viking 1 took pictures so we could find a good landing spot for the sister ship The Viking 2. That is when the pictures the ship took were sent back to us to examine. That is when we first saw the 2 mile long face for the first time. The suprise was short lived however as we soon relised what it was,a messa. People were sure it was more than that. They believed it to be a space craft.  In 1998 we sent a different ship,the Mars Global Surveyor, back there to locate the face and to take better pictures of the face. People were still not impressed with the finding of the MGS. There was fog in the picture as the area the face is in is always foggy. They said the fog was obsurring the photo. They also belived that aliens were using fog to hide it and some alien space crafts they belived was surrounding the face. They picture without the fog to beleive what we saw.  In 2001 we again sent the MGS to take pictures of the face. We went on a clear summer day when there was no fog presant and we had to tilt the camera 25 degress to get the picture right on. This picture had the face bigger than a thum compared to the pixel sized faces before it. It was exacly the picture they need to prove it was a messa.  As you can see in the photos it is a messa on a different plant. Comparring it to Earth it would be just like the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The eyes nose and mouth were just shadows being casted onto it which is why the other pictures have the feature while the new one does not . After 25 years of people talking and theorizing about it on the new and on the radio we can finally put an end to this mystery.		0
Hey, so for this essay, I'm gonna talk about why working in a group is super helpful for completing projects. Like, it's not just about getting the work done, it's also about learning how to work with others and stuff.  First of all, when you're in a group, you can divide the workload and stuff. Like, if you're working on a big project, it can be really hard to do it all by yourself. But if you're in a group, you can assign tasks to each other and work on different parts of the project. This way, you can get the work done faster and more efficiently. Plus, you don't have to worry about doing all the work yourself, which can be really stressful.  Another thing is that working in a group can help you learn how to communicate better. Like, you have to communicate with your group members to make sure everyone knows what they're doing and when things are due. This can help you learn how to express yourself clearly and listen to others. It's also important to be able to work through conflicts and disagreements, which can happen in any group. But if you learn how to handle them now, it will be way easier when you're in a real job or something.  And lastly, working in a group can help you develop better relationships with your classmates. Like, you get to know them better and learn how to work with them. This can be really helpful in the future when you're in a real job and you have to work with people you don't know that well. You can use the skills you learned in group projects to work well with them and get things done.  So, in conclusion, working in a group is super helpful for completing projects. It can help you divide the workload, communicate better, and develop better relationships with your classmates. It's not just about getting the work done, it's also about learning how to work with others and stuff.		1
Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This can be seen in examples such as the car-free community of Vauban in Germany, the driving ban in Paris due to smog, and the success of car-free days in Bogota, Colombia. By reducing car usage, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative forms of transportation, and create more sustainable and livable communities.  One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in certain areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce these emissions and combat climate change. The example of car-free communities like Vauban, where only 30% of families own cars, shows that it is possible to live without cars and still have a high quality of life.  In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about the driving ban in Paris highlights how smog levels significantly decreased when cars were restricted. Smog is a major issue in many cities around the world, and car emissions contribute to this problem. By encouraging alternative forms of transportation, such as biking, walking, or public transit, we can reduce air pollution and create healthier environments for people to live in.  Promoting alternative forms of transportation is another advantage of limiting car usage. The passage mentions how in Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance, rather than in distant malls. This not only promotes physical activity and a healthier lifestyle but also reduces the need for cars for everyday tasks. Similarly, the car-free days in Bogota encourage people to utilize buses, bikes, or skates for their daily commute. By providing and improving alternative transportation options, we can reduce congestion on the roads and make transportation more accessible for everyone.  Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more sustainable and livable communities. The passage about Vauban highlights how the absence of cars has created a peaceful and pleasant environment, where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children can be heard instead of motor noise. This creates a safer and more enjoyable community for residents. Additionally, car-free zones and pedestrian-friendly streets can encourage social interactions, support local businesses, and improve the overall quality of life in a neighborhood.  In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages for individuals and society. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote alternative forms of transportation, and create more sustainable and livable communities. Examples from Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive effects of limiting car usage. By adopting smart planning strategies and encouraging alternative transportation options, we can build a future that is less dependent on cars and more focused on sustainable and healthy living.		1
Dear, Senator of Florida  After reading this story/argument i think we should remove the Electoral college, why? Because i think we shoud be able to have the final vote, not the electoral voters. It states in paragraph 15 that "it is the electors who elect the president, not the people." "when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors." (paragraph 15) the reason why is cause they vote on the more who has the responsibility on taking part as president.  The electoral college has 538 electors and about 270 electoral vote are required to elect president. There is one member of the house in your state of representatives also 2 for your senate. But in the district of columbia therenis allocated 3 electors that are treated like a state. This election is held every four yearson the Tuesday after the first Monday of November. So when you vote, you dont vote for the whivh presidnt your actualy voting for the candidtes electors.  "It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win national popular vote. But in the year 2000, Gore had more popular votes then Bush,and Bush had less fewer electoral votes. This yet has not happened very rarely, but it was the first time ever since 1888." That only happened cause the elctoral votes made it happen. some informstion i put up there is to inform you what they do and how many votes are required to elect president compared to the thousands of people voting for the president.  I say that the electoral college is unfair! why? well there's resons. The first is cause they lost the presidency the year 2000 with Gore and Bush. Second of all people who favored the seperation of race.  We, people shoud be able to vote on the president to make our vote count! Not on just voting for the electors the elect the president. Let our votes be heard to the people not the just the elctoral college.    		0
Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:  Hey, guys! Today we're talking about this thing where some schools are thinking about letting students graduate in three years instead of four. Like, I know it might seem cool to get out of school early and start your life, but honestly, I think it's a bad idea.  So, first of all, think about how much stress it would be on students. I mean, we're already trying to balance schoolwork, sports, and hanging out with friends. If we had to cram all that into three years instead of four, it would be crazy! We wouldn't have enough time to do anything, let alone relax and have fun. And let's be real, who wants to be stressed out all the time? Not me, that's for sure!  And then there's the fact that we wouldn't have time for elective classes. Like, I really want to learn how to play the guitar, but we only have like, an hour a week to do it. If we graduated early, we wouldn't have that extra time to explore our interests and figure out what we really want to do with our lives. It's important to have time to explore and try new things, you know?  And what about college preparation? I mean, we're supposed to be getting ready for college, but if we graduate early, we'd have less time to take the SATs, apply to colleges, and all that stuff. It would be super stressful and confusing, and I don't think we'd be as prepared as we need to be.  So, yeah, I think it's better to stick with the traditional four-year graduation plan. It might be longer, but it's worth it in the end. We get more time to relax, explore our interests, and prepare for college. Plus, it's just more fun that way!  That's my opinion, anyway. What do you guys think? Do you think three-year graduation is a good idea, or do you think we should stick with the traditional plan? Let me know in the comments! üòÉ		1
Most people own cars and rarely do you see anyonw without one. Well, there are many benifts that come with limiting car useage. For starters one would be much happier without a car. Because when you have a car your always tense. And that can come from almost anything when your driveing.  Another great benfit of limiting your car useage is beacause of traffic. owning a car, your often stuck in between cars waiting for lights to change or for people to move. But if you limit your car useage then you won't be stuck in traffic jams. You can move from point A to point B in no time.  Again there are so many things that can benfit you from less car useage. For example in Paris they ban driveing because of "smog". Limiting your car useage will also lower the pollutiion in the air. Like I've been saying all this time car useage is something that only causes stress arond the world.  There is more than just these three things that benfit you if you use less car useage. You can also lose wait if your walking all the time. Its a great way to burn those calories if thats what you want.  You will also be super healthy because you will excerciseing alot more than you would with a car. Your body is moving and thats all that really matters. There are so many advaanges of no car useage.  Another thing that is that your body will become stronger. Because since you will be walking or running to where ever you need to go you will improve your strength. You won't be weak or like a noodle but muscle will be built.  So like I've been saying there are so many advanages to less car useage. Mostly becaus ein the end you will be happier, calm, and well excrised. Something that is alot easier than what we may have thought.  Those are the advages of having less car useage. because its more benfital than what everybeody may think.     		0
While some claim the Face on Mars is evidence of alien life, the facts point to a natural explanation. As a scientist who has studied this landform closely, I believe the evidence clearly shows the Face is simply a coincidental arrangement of rock formations shaped by natural geological processes over millions of years.  Several key points from the article support this view. First, when observed at a larger scale with higher resolution images, the facial features that gave it the appearance of a statue carving are less clear and distinct. This suggests the formation was not deliberately constructed but is an accidental convergence of sloping terrain. Second, similar patterned or pareidolic landforms can be found elsewhere on Mars and other planets that no one asserts were artificially made. Their shapes are formed by natural weathering and erosion over eons.   Some specifics about the geology of that region of Mars also comport with natural formation rather than artificial sculpting. The stripes and layers in the surrounding terrain indicate it was shaped by landslides or mudflows. The article also notes sediments in that area weather in a way that can form irregular and possibly misleading patterns. Considering the formidable challenges of transporting anything from another world and setting it on the surface of Mars intact, it seems farfetched to conclude aliens deliberately created an appearance resembling a human face.   In conclusion, upon close analysis, the evidence from higher resolution images and an understanding of Martian geology points overwhelmingly to a natural origin for the so-called Face on Mars. While its vague facial aspect initially seems provocative, a balanced look at the full context and detail shows it is more plausibly an accidental outcome of normal geological processes rather than artificially produced traces of extraterrestrial beings. Unless compelling new data emerges, the most scientifically justified position remains that the Face is simply a fortuitous arrangement of natural rock and terrain features shaped by the environmental conditions on Mars over eons.		1
Dear, Principal  The change you have made in the policy of maintaining a B grade average to participate in other school activities is a great decision.  There are many reasons why this is a good decision.  For example students will be forced to work harder in school.  The students would be study more and to do their homework more often if they wanted to play any sports or other after school activities.  Further more the some of the students would be less stressed over tests they have to take.  The students would of studied more to get at least a B on the tests so they wouldn't be as worried about the test.  The students would also become smarter and will realize school comes before sports or other after school activities.  This would help them in other activities that they are doing such as sports.  The students will work a lot harder in school by changing the policy.  Changing the policy from maintaining a C average to a B average is a Good idea.  The students will study harder, do their homework, and become smarter by doing this.            		0
Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Why is attending an in school courses a beneficial way ? Learning from school helps a student to be more beneficial because, it helps a person be more fast with their work because they know there is a dead line .And learning in school helps work in a destructive area or environment and help you learn how to be more focused. But attending classes from home by online is a convenient way for others because it's less stressful and help with the focus and with less destruction or disturbances, it helps finish more work than an in school attender. Benefits now would be that a student attending in school would know time management and can learn the ability to work through distractions or any disturbances. Although students at home taking online classes would probably be more dependent and have better grades,it should be known that every student or kid should have the accessibility to a social and an interactive life and some skill that needs to be picked up by a person or student and the responsibilities of growing up.  And a way to interact with other as in social skills. Benefits later would be an a student attending online classes can be ahead of students in school and start an early career but would lack the ability for social skills and also an online class taker would be more dependent on their self.  Students who go to in school to take classes are more experienced because they've had the guidance of most teachers and counselors to help them get through the hardship and with all the problems that students go through also even though students who take courses online at home might get a head start¬†at a career they might probably lack the skill of advice and the knowledge that an in school student might have. Because a student in school might have learnt that in careers you need to be social on time and even maybe work overtime or even work ahead of time to be successful because an online class taker had all the time to finish every work the lack of efficiency would not be a skill an online class taker would have. A student who take classes in school would most likely most be OK with working over time and a home course learner might deny the request.  Students who stay home to learn by taking online courses might have some skill that an in school student might not have like the stay home student is gonna have to be more dependent on self because they would have to depend on their self to do everything without the help of an expert. As in the act of careers the student that take courses can be more responsible and dependent on to work on other stuff even though the student that was in school would have that skill the student that took online classes might have it even more because they never had any help ever they would be more experienced.  The benefits in taking an in school course is very useful in every kids life because it help with the most important skill being social skill it makes a person more used to the different behaviors of people and how to go about certain situations and how to solve them and also the skill to work in any destructive situations no matter what the situation is you should able cancel it out and focus on the real work thats important to you in the situation also some other benefits are in physical education, student might have a passion for some kind¬†of sport being participated in school and can join teams and other resourceful meeting that can helping that kind of career but an online class student that stay home can never join a team to figure out their future because they would never have a chance in trying it out .And a student in school can also learn from others mistakes around other students and make sure they never repeat the same mistakes. A student staying home to take online classes will never have a chance to learn from others mistakes because well they would be home with no social life and no regrets in no bad decisions.  Although students at home taking online classes would probably be more dependent on their self and have better grades, it should be known that every student or kid should have the accessibility to a social interactive life and some skills that needs to be picked up by a student or some responsibility of growing up. Staying home and taking courses has it's perks but it also a bad decision because the child could lack all the responsibilities needed in the near future. it could help with lots like self dependent . While student that go to in school have more experience and then some that a stay home online class taker might be missing like the responsibility of owning to your mistakes , learning from others mistakes u can learn to work in destructive surroundings and have all the social skills needed and try out for your own career in whether it's physical skills or hands on.		0
Working in groups versus working alone at school is a common debate among students. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to consider which one is best suited for different situations. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of working in groups versus working alone at school, and compare and contrast how these two types of working impact grades, collaboration with friends, and developing independent and social skills.  Working in groups has several advantages. Firstly, it allows for collaboration and the sharing of ideas. When working in a group, students can bounce ideas off each other and come up with creative solutions to problems. This can lead to higher grades as the group can work together to complete assignments and projects. Additionally, working in groups can help students develop social skills, such as communication and conflict resolution. When working in a group, students must learn to listen to others and work together to achieve a common goal. This can also help students develop independence, as they learn to rely on others and work collaboratively.  However, working in groups also has its disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be difficult to find a group of students who work well together. This can lead to conflicts and difficulties in completing assignments. Additionally, working in a group can be distracting, as students may not be focused on the task at hand. This can lead to lower grades and a lack of productivity.  Working alone, on the other hand, has its own set of advantages. Firstly, it allows for more focus and concentration. When working alone, students can work at their own pace and focus on the task at hand. This can lead to higher grades as they are able to complete assignments and projects more efficiently. Additionally, working alone can help students develop independence and self-reliance. When working alone, students must take responsibility for their own learning and work to complete tasks on their own.  However, working alone also has its disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be isolating. Working alone can lead to a lack of social interaction and can make it difficult for students to develop social skills. Additionally, working alone can be difficult for some students, as they may struggle with self-motivation and discipline. This can lead to lower grades and a lack of productivity.  In conclusion, both working in groups and working alone have their advantages		1
Why asking multiple people for advice helps people make better choices  People always want to find a single, simple answer. Though, people can't find that answer in just one way. Sometimes people can find multiple answers in multiple people, but that does not make it the right answer. It's always better to ask trusted people of advice, but sometimes there not there to ask, so asking others can get results as well. Asking multiple people can help so others can do their best, it can broaden someones options to better choices, and so that people can know what's right .  One reason why asking multiple people can help to make healthy¬†decisions, is so that people can do their best. One example of this is called constructive criticism. An example of a job that has a lot of constructive criticism is an editing firm. Writers will have editors who will instruct the writer what needs to be changed or added. Sometimes, the editor sends¬†copies¬†of the book to friends or colleagues so they can get even more input so they can help the writer as much as possible. That is why constructive criticism can help people make healthy decisions.  Another reason people ask multiple people so they can make the healthy choice, is so that people can broaden their options. There is never only one right option, there can be multiple right options! Sometimes people will get really good advice from someone, but they can't fallow the advice because of some type of setback. So getting multiple healthy choices can help the person so if they need too, they can still get where they want to go. Even if there is a really great answer, people can't always fallow it.  The final reason why asking multiple people for advise can help make healthy decisions, is so that they know what the right decision is. If someone asks only one person, they will only get their opinion on what is right. Asking more than one person however, someone could see that maybe person A would rather lie than to tell the truth, while¬†maybe the persons B, C, and D would tell the truth. Now, based off of others morals, it would be better and healthier to tell the truth rather than to lie. People may have different opinions, but it's still important to do what is right.  In the past few paragraphs, it explains¬†why people would want to ask multiple people so that they can make the best decision possible. In the first paragraph, it explains why people would give constructive criticism to others and how it could help them. In the second paragraph, it talked about how broadening someones options can help them find multiple good answers. Finally, in the last paragraph, it explains the importance of finding the best answer even if some people disagree. That is why a person might ask multiple people, so that they can make the best and healthiest¬†decision they can.		0
Dear ,  I have recently heard that you are considering changing the C average for participating in sports or other activities to a B average. Although I do fully understand why you would choose to do this I believe that it should be kept at a C average. Many students in this school participate in additional activities and it is hard to keep your grades at tip top level. It's sort of like multi-tasking, it doesn't really work. Some students may want to take up a career in a certain sport or major in a certain activity. It's not always easy to be the best at both.  Many students at this school play soccer on the school soccer team and are considering doing it professionally. That may sound ridiculous to a person who works business because a sport doesn't sound like a suitable job for a life. An athlete would disagree. That is the job that person would enjoy doing for awhile. Work is supposed to be a job you do to earn money, but it should also be enjoyable, after all you do have to work everyday. It would be difficult for a student to have to focus on two things, grades and sports. If that student so chooses to be an athlete, than they'll want to focus on their sport.  Changing the grade may be one positive thing for our school, but many negative things follow. Trust me, you will get many complaints from students and parents daily. A grade C has always been the average for participating in sports/activities and I think that is very reasonable. Most people anyways do better than that anyhow, but pressuring students to keep their grade above a B may be asking a lot. Again that means they have to focus on academics and activities.  Think about when you first wanted to become a teacher or a principal. In High school and college you just wanted to focus on academics and becoming a great, fun teacher. But college required you taking extracurricular activities. How did you feel? You only wanted to focus on one thing and they made you focus on two, but less on one. Students who participate in sports feel the same way. They have to take both academics and sports, but they would much rather just be doing the sport. Aren't teachers, parents... grown-ups always telling us to follow our dreams. Limiting our dreams is only going to be misguiding your words.  I really do want you to think about what I said before you change the Grade average. Thank you so much for taking your own time out of your day to read this and consider it. I, and the students really do appreciate it!  Sincerely,      		0
Failure is like, totally essential in the pursuit of success, you know? Like, without it, how would we even know what success tastes like? I mean, think about it, if every time we tried something new, we automatically succeeded, it would be, like, super boring and unfulfilling.  Like, Winston Churchill said, "What is Success Without Failure?" and I think that's, like, super deep. He's like, totally right, you know? Failure is like, this huge stepping stone that helps us climb up to success. It's like, the struggles and setbacks we face along the way make the final achievement so much sweeter.  For example, like, I used to love playing soccer, but I was, like, really bad at it. I would always get substituted out in the middle of the game, and it was, like, super embarrassing. But, like, I didn't give up. I kept practicing and working hard, and now I'm one of the best players on my team. If I had never failed at soccer, I wouldn't have developed the perseverance and determination that I have now.  And it's not just, like, sports. Failure can happen in, like, anything. Whether it's a project in school or a relationship or something, failure is, like, this huge learning experience that helps us grow and become better people.  So, like, don't be afraid to fail, you know? Embrace it, and let it fuel your fire to succeed. Because, like, without failure, success wouldn't be as sweet. And who wants to eat a bland, boring piece of cake when you could have a delicious, flavorful one with a little bit of struggle and effort? Not me, that's for sure.  In conclusion, failure is, like, totally essential to success. It's like, this huge part of the journey that helps us become better people and achieve our goals. So, like, don't be afraid to fail, and keep on keepin' on until you reach your success!		1
In this argument I'm going to tell you why the face on Mars, is acually a landform.  On the red planet called Cydonia A.K.A Mars. Twenty five years ago NASA Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars snapping photos of landing sites when they came across a landfrom that looked like a human face. When scientist saw the picture they thought it was just another martian mesa, that is common around in Mars, but it had unusual shadows that made it look like a Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA showed the image for all to see. The caption was "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth." They thought it would be a good way to attract attention, but some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization in Mars, although few scientist believed the face was an alien artifact. The first image appered on a web site, revealing... a natural landform it was actually a martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landform common around the american west  That was my argument I hope you will take my side that the face was not created by aliens and it was mearly a landform.		0
Have you ever participated in a extracurricular activity at school, Did you enjoy it? In today's day and age there are tons of extracurricular activities and even maybe some you never heard about. Its always nice to give something a try even if you have never done it before. You could even join something that you have already done before and that your good at. For example, if you are good at basketball you could join the basketball club and have fun doing what you like. I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can gain new experiences, it could help with their health, and they can make new friends.  My first reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is that they gain new experiences. Its always nice to try something that you've never done before. For example, lets say you have no experience in cooking and theres a cooking club you can join. By joining that club you could learn about different foods and how to cook them. Those cooking skills that you learned could take you a long way or help you with something simple like cooking you or somebody else some food at home. Another example could be joining a club that has to do with the wild and things like nature. You could learn about things like how to make a fire or what plants are dangerous and which are not. There could even be some hands on experiences like fields trips to go camping or just explore the wilderness. These could help you if you ever wanted to go camping on your own later on in the future. These are just some of the things you would get to experience joining new clubs,there are so many more.  My second reason that students should join extracurricular activities is that it could help with their health. If students join a club they will be surrounded by other students and this will help them stay socially active. Instead of being at home in a dark room playing video game or on their phones, they could be talking other students and enjoying the activities in the club. Its always nice to have people surrounding so that way your not alone. Being alone could lead to things like depression or social anxiety and no student should have to go through any of those things. Another way it could help with their health is by joining a sports club. By joining any sports club students will be getting at least forty minutes to a hour of daily exercise. This exercise that the students are getting could help them with things like weight loss or just trying to stay in shape. Its always good to try and maintain good health and these are some great ways to do it.  My third and final reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is that they can make new friends. By joining these extracurricular activities students may meet other students they have never seen before. This could be a opportunity for them to be able to make new friends. On top of that, they could most likely have the same interests as they chose the same club or activity. For example if they joined soccer they may have a interest in soccer and they could build off of that. Once they become friends they could do things like help each other¬†in school or maybe even hang out. They could even introduce each other to other friends that they have. For example, One student could ask the friend he made in the Art club if he wanted to sit with him during lunch and now that the student has been introduced and they can all be friends now. Making friends is always a good and fun thing to do.  Overall, extracurricular activities are a good thing for students. Whether its if your making friends, helping out your health, or even learning new experiences. Extracurricular activites are a big help to students. They should be encouraged to join and try them. I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they gain new experiences, it could help with their health, and they can make new friends.		0
 The car-free city movement is gaining popularity as cities around the world begin to realize the advantages of limiting car usage. Car-free cities offer a range of benefits that can help to reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and create a safer and more livable environment for citizens. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of car-free cities and why they should become more prevalent in our society.   One of the key advantages of car-free cities is reduced traffic congestion. Cars are a major cause of traffic congestion, and with fewer cars on the roads, cities can experience a significant decrease in traffic. This can lead to faster commutes, shorter travel times, and a more efficient transportation system. Additionally, reducing the number of cars on the road can also help to reduce pollution and noise pollution, creating a more pleasant living environment for citizens.   Another advantage of car-free cities is improved air quality. Cars are a major contributor to air pollution, and with fewer cars on the road, cities can experience a significant reduction in air pollution. This can help to improve the health of citizens by reducing the amount of harmful pollutants they are exposed to. In addition to reducing air pollution, car-free cities can also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which can contribute to climate change.   Car-free cities can also create a safer and more livable environment for citizens. With fewer cars on the road, there is less chance of accidents and other traffic-related injuries. Additionally, reducing the use of cars can help to reduce crime rates, as car theft and other crimes related to car ownership are common in cities. By creating a safer and more livable environment, car-free cities can help to attract new businesses and residents, which can boost the local economy.   Finally, car-free cities can also help to reduce the amount of money citizens spend on transportation. Cars can be expensive to own and operate, and with fewer cars on the road, cities can help to reduce the cost of owning a car. This can help to free up more disposable income for citizens to spend on other things, such as education, healthcare, or savings.   In conclusion, car-free cities offer a range of advantages that can help to create a better quality of life for citizens. By reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, creating a safer environment, and reducing the cost of transportation, car-free cities can help to create a more livable and sustainable future. As more cities join the car-free movement, we can work towards a more efficient, healthy, and sustainable transportation system for all.		1
Okay, here is my essay:  Hey, guys! So, we all know how hard it can be to make decisions sometimes. Like, what if you're trying to decide what game to play with your friends, but you can't choose between Mario Kart and Fortnite? Or what if you're trying to decide what to wear to school, but you can't decide between your favorite t-shirt and that one pair of pants that you know your mom likes? It's super frustrating, right?  Well, I recently did some research on how to become more decisive, and I found some pretty cool methods that I want to share with you guys. First, you can try something called the "Pros and Cons List." It's like, you write down all the pros and cons of each option, and then you can see which one is the best choice. It's like, if you're trying to decide between two restaurants, you can write down all the things you like about each one, and then compare them. It's pretty easy!  Another thing you can try is called "Prioritizing." It's like, you make a list of all the things that are important to you, and then you can see which option is the most important. So, if you're trying to decide between two video games, you can make a list of all the things you like about each one, and then see which one has the most things on your list. It's pretty cool!  I also found out about something called "Decision Mapping." It's like, you make a map of all the different options, and then you can see how they connect to each other. So, if you're trying to decide between two different college majors, you can make a map of all the different classes you'll have to take, and then see how they connect to each other. It's pretty helpful!  I tried out all of these methods, and you know what? They actually worked! I was able to make some really tough decisions, and I felt so much better afterward. Like, I was able to decide which game to play with my friends, and I even got to wear my favorite t-shirt to school. It was great!  So,		1
Part of our current edgucation system provides free chidcare to parents in adition to helping yonger students develope socially. This is why brick and morder schools will always be a necesity for elementery schoolers, but students outside that age range should have the opportunity to demonstrate their responcibility inorder to receive the privilage of being taught at home rather then at school because of social distractions, and the general time sink that is school .  All you ever hear about public schools today is bullying, exclusion, and drama that is pointless and distracts students from their academics, the solution is right infront of us, online school. Online school would be superior to traditional brick and morter school because students would have minimul opportunities to interact with one and other durring class which would make classroom control easier for the teacher. In adition to students having minimul opportunities to speak in class, everything that was said durring the class could be monitered by the teacher or by an automated program designed to detect any buzz words, unkind or curse words. The audomation could also keep count of the number of times students cursed or said rude things to eachother and report these infractions to the teacher. While this process might sound invasive, it isn't anything that teachers don't try to facilitate with physically, now they can do it technologically.  While the inclass conversations can definently be monitered, there is also out of class social media and txting that could be distracting during online class time, and with no physical adult in the room telling students to put away the phone how could we be sure that we aren't just trading one evil for another? While there are numerous distractions at home that could cause students grades to dip, the solution to this potential problem is that online school would need to be a privilage and not a right. Class time would need to be monitered.  Another benafit of monitered online school is that with less distractions the class could move faster which would allow extra time for students to persue recreational activities, and academic interests- this system would allow students to seperate their work time from their play time in a way that is just not possible today. This system of having extra time to dedicate to passions would also be benafitial in incentivising students to pay attention during class. This system also promotes better friendships by giving students time to persue interests outside of school-- providing an outlet to meet like minded people.  While online school isn't a perfect solution, it could change the way that manny students view school as a whole. Instead of being forced to sit in a building all day with other kids, we could be at home leaning on our own time with pre-recorded videos. With online schooling students get the opportunity to control their own edcation, and they are also incentivised to preform well, not because they are compeeting for spots at some perstegeous collage, but becuause they want their own free time.¬†   ¬†		0
Along with other students, Summer has always been one of my favorite seasons; the reason for this is because there's no school. Since there's no school for students during summer, we tend to forget everything that was taught to us throughout the school year. Schools believe students should not forget all of the valuable things we learned throughout the school year when we go into summer break, for this reason many schools require students to complete a summer project. The issue with having a summer project is many people can't decide if the project should be teacher-designed or student-designed. I believe the project should be teacher-designed because they know what knowledge the project should have for the students to learn, and they would know what projects would interest the students.  Some may argue and claim: the students would know better than the teachers on what interest them. Though, as everyone may probably know, some students don't always have the same interest as each other; for example, the athletic kids may not be into what the tech kids are into. So this task to pick a project for everyone may be be difficult for the students to figure out. On the other hand, teachers may have it easier figuring out what interest all or almost all of the students. Teachers could conduct surveys and have students fill out their interest, and the teachers can design the project based on the answers provided by the survey. Although, this method may not be entirely great for each individual student, it would be great for the majority of them.  Teachers would also know what specific knowledge they would include in the projects for their students. For example, they would know what is important for the student to learn from the project and what to remember from their previous school year, so they can take that information onto the next school year. While if the summer project was designed by students; they wouldn't know what's is important for them to learn or what previous knowledge to include. The knowledge that this project would contain is crucial to the learning and understanding of the students. This is something that possibly only teachers would be able to prepare correctly: for students this would be too much responsibility.  Though, seeing the side of the students wanting to design the project is very understandable. I understand that they feel as if they know themselves and their peers better than the teachers, so they would know what type of project would attract the other students. Students could also ask their teacher from the previous and the following year: what is beneficial and important for them to learn from the project. Although, it's better if the teachers were to design the project, that doesn't mean the students don't have the ability to do it.  Therefore, students can design the summer project if given the chance, but given the circumstances, it's better if the teachers would have the responsibility of designing it. Teachers just know what knowledge the project should contain for the students to learn, and they would know what type of project would interest the students. I've thoroughly explained why teachers would be the better candidate for this job, rather than the students.  Overall, what's important here is not who designs the project, but instead the project itself. This project determines what is valuable for the students to know before going into the following school year.		0
In the summer when schools require students to complete summer projects I think that these projects should be teacher designed, because if the projects we're students designed the projects wouldnt be as much of a learning process then if it we're a teachers designed project.  first of all why I think that summer projects should be designed by teachers is the learning process of the project. Projects are for students to show what they know and learn more about what they have to research and they would have to take more time in finding factual research about their topics. This is good for students in the summer because it keeps them intact with school in some shape of form and it would keep the students occupied rather than them playing video games, or doing some other thing that rots their brain. To add on by teachers giving out projects in the summer will also benefit the students as well. For example my cousin Adam who lives in newyork was enjoying his summer like any other teen would do, well while he was doing what he was interested in doing he also did not something school related all summer such as reading, researching etc this also too a toll on him because since he wasnt doing anything school related over summer he began to lose focus more in school.  Secondly, why I think teacher should be designing projects in the summer is that it gives them something to do while just doing nothing all summer long. Students could be doing things completely different from school during the summer days, by teachers giving out projects could possibly keep students out of trouble during the summer and it also get their next year of school started off to a great start by them doing the projects. Also by teachers hand out projects in the summer shows that they truly care about their students education and would love to see them succeed and expand their knowledge furthermore.  My third reasoning on why I think ti should be the teachers who design the summer projects is that they are not likely to do projects if they had to design it them self. To add on for example if students were allowed to design their own projects they would most certainly become less focus because they would feel like they wouldnt have to do the project as much or take as serious because they're the ones designing it and not the teachers. By the students designing their own summer projects and most likely not doing could really hurt their school life and their start off grade for the start of the new school year.  Although, some may say that students should be able to design their own summer projects because it allows them to show the teachers what they can do by them self, also lets students work at their own past, and wont overwhelm the students because they get to design anything i their choice. This may be true but like I said before students tend to lose interest and focus more quickly if they seem that the task isnt as important to them. So by teachers designing these summer projects would make it seem more important to the students and it would make them want to do it even more and get benefits out of it.   ¬† ¬†¬†   ¬† ¬†¬†		0

 It's better to communicate with a variety of people rather than just one, as different individuals have their own unique perspectives and experiences to share. When talking to different people, you can gain valuable insights and advice that may not have been considered before. For example, someone who has gone through a similar situation may have valuable tips on how to handle it, while another person may have a different approach that could be equally effective.  Furthermore, talking to a variety of people can help you gain a more well-rounded understanding of a situation. By hearing different perspectives, you can gain a better appreciation for the complexity of the issue and the various factors that may be at play. This can help you make more informed decisions and take a more nuanced approach to the situation.  Additionally, talking to a variety of people can help you build stronger relationships. When you take the time to listen to and engage with others, you can deepen your connections and build a stronger sense of community. This can be especially beneficial in times of stress or difficult situations, as having a supportive network of people to turn to can make all the difference.  In conclusion, talking to a variety of people rather than just one is a valuable approach to gaining insight and building stronger relationships. By seeking out diverse perspectives and experiences, you can gain a more well-rounded understanding of a situation and make more informed decisions. So, the next time you're faced with a difficult situation, consider reaching out to a variety of people to gain their insights and perspectives.		1
Hey, have you ever gone into a store and seen something you wanted but it was going to take almost all of your money so you go and ask a friend for their opinion. Well growing up, I would always ask my mom for her opinion because she was older and knew more than I did. Since then, i've always asked my mom for her opinion and I have saved a lot of money because of her. That's why I think seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make better choices because it can be a learning experience, boost their mood, and can help them financially.  When seeking for multiple opinions it truly becomes a learning experience because many people are going to tell you what you shouldn't do, and many of their reasons on what you should do aren't even going to be reasons you didn't even think about. In addition,many people will tell you things you didn't know when you ask for their opinion, Let's say someone ask their friend if they should get their favorite food and their friend responds with no, they have a lot a chemicals that arent good for your body. You get to learn why you should or shouldn't do.  Therefore, a lot of people are generally scared when you ask them for their opinion because they do not want to offend anyone. They might even feel like they are stepping on your toes when you ask them your opinion because they don't know how you are going to act or even respond,But if they tell the truth it might hurt your feelings on their opinion but it will boost your mood because you know that you have a real and true friend who is looking out for you. It's like asking someone "Hey, do you like my dress?" and they respond with " No, not really." you'll be a little sad but happy. You'll even be happy if they say "yeah I like your dress." People ask for opinions when they don't know what to do or if they should spend or waste they're money. Going around and asking for opinions is great because you'll be able to hear what other people would do and if you don't get what you or do what you want your mood will be boosted because your walking away with money to spear. In addition, you'll change your spending habits and the things you buy.  Finally, When you seek for people's opinions you tend to start bringing awareness to what you want and if you really need it. People's opinions change the way we think, when asking for peoples opinions it can really save us from many things especially financially. In today's generation they don't care about how much it cost they care about the name and label that comes with the shirts thats over one hundred dollars. They are wasting their money on something they are going to grow out of. Asking someone if they should get the overpriced shirt and then telling them no is going to help them financially because they will still have a lot of money if they just go and a buy a regular shirt. People's opinions can help other people financially because you could ask your friend if you should get this or that and they might not have enough so they go and borrow money and so on and so fourth they could go into dept, But if someone stepped in and helped them with that decisions and told them it was a waste of money they wouldn't be in the situation they're in now. My mom would always tell me "the less money you spend, the more you save." which has stuck with me through out the years because that is a rule I always follow.  In conclusion, People's opinions change and affect the way we live, we could never live without people's opinions. Always ask for peoples opinions because you'll learn new things and experience new things. You'll get to see different perspectives and understand where people are coming from and how they feel.		0
Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There are several key reasons for this.   First and foremost, using a cell phone while driving is distracting and prevents the driver from paying full attention to the road. Talking, texting, or any other cell phone activity takes the driver's eyes and minds off of their primary task - safely operating the vehicle. This greatly increases the risk of accidents. Studies have shown that cell phone use while driving can reduce situational awareness and reaction time as much as having a blood alcohol content at the legal limit of intoxication.   Secondly, cell phone use presents a significant danger to others on the road, not just the user. Any lapse in attention or delayed reaction time could result in an accident that harms or even kills innocent people. Driving is not a solitary act - the actions of one driver can impact public safety. When we drive, we have a responsibility to minimize risks and protect others. Using a cell phone violates that responsibility.  Lastly, banning cell phone use except for emergencies would set a clear standard and norm that supports road safety. Partial bans or limitations are confusing and difficult for law enforcement to consistently apply. An outright ban sends a strong message that cell phones do not belong in the hands of drivers unless in emergencies or using hands-free options. Clear, straightforward laws are easier for all drivers to understand and obey.   In summary, cell phone use poses unacceptable risks to driver and public safety. The costs of even brief distractions are too high when lives are at stake on the road. For this reason, drivers should not be permitted to use cell phones in any capacity except in emergency situations. Public safety and responsible driving must take priority over any non-emergency cell phone activity behind the wheel.		1
The Face on Mars is a natural landform, though, some may think that it was created by aliens. NASA's research has shown otherwise. The Face was not made by aliens, but under natural circumstances. There were many high quality pictures of this landform taken and many scientist who studied them. Scientist have come to conclusion that the Face is just a natural landform that has taken a not so natural shape.  Many people still believe that the Face is some sort of acient alien monument. These conspiracy theorists think that NASA is just trying to hide the evidence of life on Mars. As said in the article "defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars" (Unmasking the Face on Mars). Believers were still skeptical so, to be sure, NASA took more pictures of the Face that were clear to the eye. With these new high resolution pictures, as Garvin said, "you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size." Basically, if there were life on Mars we would be able to see even the smallest of things through these photographs. There was nothing unusal found.  For 25 years conspiracy theorists have been questioning NASA's research. Specifically, on Mars and whether or not there is alien life on it. There have been movies and books that fanticize on the things that could possibly be living on the Red Planet. These theories are not backed up by knowledge and facts like NASA's. NASA's scientist are the best of the best when it comes to knowing abot outer space. These scientist have seen Mars, and the Face, in person. Most of the theorist have never left the planet. Lastly, there are many natural landforms like the Face on our own planet. An example of this is, Middle Butte in the Snake River PLain of Idaho as pointed out by Jim Garvin.  Outer space is the home to many mysteries bu, the fact that the Face is a clue to alien civilation isn't one. Even though the landform looks as if it could a ruin of a acient alien civilization, the facts have shown that it is not. Through studying the pictures and positioning of the Face, NASA's professionals were able to conclude that it was just a natural landform much like the ones found here on Earth. This does not mean that there is no life on Mars, it just means that the Face is not a hint to finding it.		0
Dear Senator,  I respect and admire your position in office for you are always on your toes and doing work for your people. But one thing I do not admire as a citizen of the U.S., is the Electoral College in which our country goes by. When saying Electoral College I am meaning the process in which the election of the President by a vote is compromised with a popular vote of qualified citizens. By changing to a popular vote, everyone is equal and our location won't restrain us from our vote that we cast. The Electoral College may have suited our countries needs in the past but it is now time to abolish this unequal process.  To get things going, the Electoral College strays to many voters away. In the article "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong", Plumer brought to my attention that many voters are aware that the canidate that they want to serve as president does not stand a chance in their state and because of this they do away with voting. Personally, I feel that voting should be something that everyone partakes in. After all, if you didn't vote you shouldn't complain. But in the boat we are in now, we (US Citizens) are being taken advantage of and are rights are simply stripped away in this form of voting. In fact, one-half on eligible American voters did not vote in 2012 and I am sure the voting process we use has a storng influence on these people. If we were to vote, in some cases they won't even matter. This lets our location define us and not our beliefs.  This leads to the next point that it gives too much power to those we elected. Yes, we did elect them and we should have faith in them, but the Electoral College makes it very difficult to do. "What Is the Electoral College?" brought it to my attention that the Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. So we simply place our votes in the hands of the minimal amount of people. I don't think so!  Lastly, did those serving in office think about the people at the bottom of the todem pole (average US citizens) rather than those at the top (serving in office)? "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" states "over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now". Because of this, it becomes clear that my opinions and rights are stripped away. It completely disgusts me at the fact our nation is treating our citizens in this manner. It is time for those in office to think about who they are serving. Fifty-five people shouldn't represent 500,000. We should all be able to cast votes equally with the same credentials.  All in all, there are in fact some limited benefits of an Electoral College, but a direct election or popular vote would suit our nation much better based on our needs in the present. Through Electoral College it is much easier to recognize who won the election and a few more advantages, but it has become very outdated and unequal. It is time for change and we must act now!    		0
In this article the author is supporting his idea about the studies of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In the article the author gives reason and evidence why. There is a posiblity to live on Venus, but still too dangerous.  Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because it may well once been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system. In paragraph 4 it says "The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains,and craters." There is even a posibility that Venus was largely covered with oceans and could have supported various form of life just like Earth. Venus can be a possibility of Earth travels. The dangers of Venus is the 97% carbon dioxide on the planet. In paragraph 3 it says " Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere." Venus atmosphere is more dangerous than ours, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience in our on planet. Can Venus be a planet we live on?  To get an understandment of Venus NASA need to get close and personal despite the risk. In paragraph 6 it says " Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. " NASA is working on different approaches. One example they gave in the article is some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide. This have been tested in a chamber simulating on Venus surface, and lasted three weeks.  Our travels shouldn't be limited by the dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation, like the author says in paragraph 8. At least try if there is a possiblity. 		0
 Driverless cars, also known as fully autonomous vehicles, have been a topic of much discussion and debate in recent years. They are seen as the future of transportation, with the potential to revolutionize the way we travel and live. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of driverless cars, as well as the current state of their development.  One of the main advantages of driverless cars is increased safety. They use sophisticated computers and sensors to constantly monitor their surrounding environment and make decisions in real-time, which can help prevent accidents caused by human error. Additionally, they have the potential to reduce congestion on the roads, as they can communicate with each other and adjust their speed accordingly. This can help reduce traffic jams and reduce travel time.  However, there are also several disadvantages to driverless cars. One of the main concerns is the potential loss of jobs. As driverless cars become more common, there will likely be fewer opportunities for cab drivers, truck drivers, and other jobs that are currently done by humans. This can lead to increased unemployment and a loss of income for many people.  Another concern is the potential cost of driverless cars. They require a significant amount of technology and infrastructure to function, which can be expensive to install. Additionally, there may be higher maintenance costs associated with their use. This can lead to higher prices for consumers, which may be a deterrent for some buyers.  The current state of driverless car development is still in its early stages, but they are becoming more common. Many major car manufacturers such as Tesla, Ford, and General Motors have invested heavily in driverless car technology, and there are already some driverless cars available on the market. However, they still require human supervision and are not fully autonomous, meaning humans must still be present to take control if necessary.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel and live, offering increased safety and convenience. However, there are also potential drawbacks, such as the loss of jobs and increased cost. The current state of development is still in its early stages, but they are becoming more common and are likely to become an integral part of our transportation system in the future.		1
Dear Senator,  I think the Electoral Collage is unfair to the citizens of the United States of America. The Electoral collage resembles too much control by the United States government. As said in Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, "Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. This dosnt even sound right does it... This is one example of United States government trying to rail¬† the presidential elections, and i can asure you that this is not the first time this has been attempted by the government. The U.S Constitution delcares that  ALL  citizens of United States of America have the right to vote. What this looks like is the government trying to vote for us. Another thing that i do not get about the Electoral Collage is why are we voting for the elector instead of just towards the president. I get that they have to monitor the votes but arnt we already using electronic computers to vote... I think voting would go alot smoother if the votes went strait to the presidents through computers instead of having an elector who has a strong personal opinion against one political party who has a chance of twisting the votes around to strongly support the political party that he/she is opinionized towards. This why the Electoral Collage is dangerous. There have been cases of law breaking electors twisting the votes around. It is alot more safe to just let the citizens to just strait up vote. In source 3, It tries to tell you all the possitive things about the Electoral Collage... The possitive things they mention about the Electoral Collage are small compared to the issues with it. The Electoral Collage is outdated and needs to be taken off. It is just unfair now.  thanks, Anonymous...¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†    		0
Electoral college is a process of electors and a poupular vote is by the people. In this argue it ask which one would i favor, i have read the artical and as i was reading i have seen that i would keep Electoral college. I have three reason. one of them it's easier for us understand how the prosses works. my second reason is some people dont care about who they vote for, and my third reason is the history of Electoral college.  My fist reason is the the way the process work. The process works as a number of electors. The electors are what count more thoes are what count to see who are next president is going to be they are the final vote. The electors get together and talk it out so see who wins the most votes. The number of electors are 538. About 270 electors are for the president. The election for the president is held every four years after the first Monday in november.  My second reason is       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†        ¬†    		0
The question is how do I feel about driverless cars? I'm going to tell you why I think it's a bad idea to have driverless cars. In my story i'm going to tell you why I don't like the idea, why a homan should always be controlling the car, and the consequences of a driverless car that could happen.  The reason I don't like the idea of a driverless car is there are so much money going to be wasted. Thousands of dollars wasted if all of a sudden your car is smashed. So many peoples lives will be at risk if they don't have a driverless car. How can you even feel comfortable knowing that you can kill somebody? In my opinion I don't like the idea of letting the car control my movements and the car makes a noticeable noise or sound that alerts me. I know some people would even fall asleep at the wheel. What if all of a sudden your car doesn't make that noise or sound without you noticing? I'll rather just control the car myself rather than letting it control me.  In my opinion I think that humans should always be at the wheel controlling it. It lets you control your actions not letting a computerized vehicle do it. What if you do get in a crash at least you know your at fault not the vehicle. Wouldn't humans get bored just sitting their? I know that some humans might fall asleep at the wheel and that can lead to a lot more problems. This is why I believe humans should control the car.  Lets talk about the consequences of a driverless car. Some consequences of a driverless car is injuries. No one wants to get hurt say your car loses signal and you fell aslepp and hurt yourself. Another consequence is if you hurt or even possibly kill someone else. That'll ruin someone's feelings of a driverless cars. The last consequence I can tell you but certainly not the only ones out there is possibly killing yourself. That can hurt so many feeling in your family. How would you think your family would feel if they said my "cousin" died from a computerized vehicle? That'll be the last thing I would expect at least right now in 2016.  There are a lot of more reasons why I think driverless cars are a bad thing. Just think about it me and you might think the same things. So I told you the reasons why I think driverless cars are a bad thing, why humans should always be controlling the car, and some consequences of a driverless cars. Not saying this could affect you personally, but I think this could hurt a lot of people in the long run.		0
I think we should totes transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy! First of all, fossil fuels are finite, which means they'll eventually run out and we'll be left with nothing. Renewable energy sources, on the other hand, are sustainable and won't run out. Like, ever!  Another reason is that fossil fuels are really bad for the environment. They release greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change and pollution. Have you seen the smoke coming out of those factory chimneys? It's like, totally toxic! Renewable energy sources, like solar and wind power, don't produce any emissions, so they're way better for the planet.  Plus, renewable energy is getting cheaper and cheaper. Like, have you seen the cost of solar panels lately? They're super affordable now! And wind turbines are getting more efficient, so they can generate more electricity with less effort. It's like, a no-brainer!  But, some people might argue that renewable energy isn't reliable. Like, what happens when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow? Well, that's where energy storage comes in. We can use batteries and other technologies to store excess energy generated by renewable sources, so we can use it when we need it. It's like, a backup plan!  In conclusion, transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy is the way to go. It's sustainable, better for the environment, and getting cheaper. Let's do this!		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.  The Electoral College is a relic of the past that is no longer relevant to our modern society. It was created in the 18th century when the United States was a much smaller country with a much different political landscape. At the time, it was believed that the Electoral College would help to prevent the two most populous states, Virginia and Massachusetts, from dominating the presidential election. However, this is no longer the case. In today's America, the Electoral College gives an unfair advantage to small, rural states. This is because each state is guaranteed at least three electoral votes, regardless of its population. This means that a voter in Wyoming has more than three times the voting power as a voter in California.  The Electoral College also leads to voter suppression. In many states, voters are not allowed to vote for the candidate of their choice if that candidate does not have a chance of winning the state. This means that millions of voters are effectively disenfranchised.  The Electoral College is also undemocratic. The candidate who wins the popular vote should be the winner of the election. This is the case in every other democratic country in the world.  I urge you to support a bill that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote. This would be a fair and democratic way to choose our nation's leader.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Introduction: If you are looking for an adventure of a lifetime, you should consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, just like I did. The program not only offers the opportunity to help others, but it also provides a chance to visit unique places and embark on exciting experiences. In this essay, I will provide reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys program and share details from the article, "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves," to support my claims. Body: Firstly, joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is a fantastic idea because you can help transport much-needed livestock to war-torn countries. As the article states, "After the devastation of the Second World War, millions of people in Europe were starving." The livestock transported by the Seagoing Cowboys provided food and nourishment for these starving individuals. By participating in the program, you have the opportunity to make a difference and positively impact the lives of people in need. Secondly, joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is a chance to visit unique places and experience exciting adventures. As the article highlights, Luke traveled around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and witnessed the Northern Lights in the North Sea. These are just some of the incredible experiences that you could have if you were a Seagoing Cowboy. Finally, the program is a fantastic opportunity to build your life skills, such as teamwork and problem-solving. In "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves," Luke mentions that he learned how to navigate the ships and work as a team with others. These skills are invaluable and will help you in all aspects of life. Conclusion: If you are a person seeking adventure, a chance to positively impact others' lives, and build essential life skills, then you should undoubtedly consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. As Luke's experiences have shown, this program provides unique opportunities to make a difference in the world and embark on unforgettable adventures.		1
Why would anyone want to become a Seagoing Cowboy, you might ask. There are actually many resons why someone should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Like I said, "The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy."  If you are working as a Seagoing Cowboy, thyen you know the feeling of when you acomplish something great. It's all one big rush of happiness, excitment,and sucess. Later on in life you will get to say, "I helped someone and I'm proud" That is just one of the many reasons.  If you like working with animals, then this might be a job for you. When I was working for the Seagoing Cowboys program, I got to work as a watchman. When you are a watchman you have to check on the animals every hour. That was an amazing experience, trust me.  Being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't all work all the time. You can find time to have fun like I did. I got to play exciting vollyball and baseball games. Along with that, I had time to read, box, fence, whittle, and play in table-tennis tounaments.  When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you get to visit amazing place such as I. You can get the chance to go to through the Panama Canal and tour a castle in Crete just on your way to China! That's not all! You can take a gondola ride in Italy, and see the Acropolis in Greece. Just think of all the amazing places you'll go.  When I was Seagoing Cowboy was the best time of my life. It gave me wonderful chances and a life full of excitment. It could give you that too. All you have to is join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You will not regret it, I promise.   		0
Ok, now how would you like to have a car that drives itself? I'm talking soon, like next 5-10 years. Sounds great, sounds real futuristic, but I just know those things can't be successful anytime soon. Personally, I would love to ride in a driverless car one day but that's a huge risk to take.  To start off with, a driverless car does sound prety cool. I mean it coulld introduce so many oppurtunities for the world that we've never seen yet. A driverless car could be the start of something new. Like Google cofounder Serge Brin believes, such cars could change the world fundamentally.  In counterclaim to that, THERE WILL NEVER BE A COMPLETELY DRIVERLESS CAR! Well, at least that's how I see it. I mean a driverless car, I know it's 2016, but that's going past the limits. It's all pure imagination if someone believes a driverless car will be accepted into the streets of the world.  There's only one HUGE reason I say it won't happen though... A driverless car will never be safe enough to count on. I mean be real, would you ride in a plane wth no pilot with only computed sensors telling you what's going on around your plane? What's going to happen if one of those sensors on the car don't react one time? Like I know everyone has had a surprise mishap with a computer-generated system before. Think if your car caught a virus or something or just was being used too much, your on the road, then our car starts going crazy and drives off the road. Who's fault will it be? What if someone gets hurt because of your car, not you or the car's manufacturer, but your car?  In conclusion to all this, I think it's a brilliant idea to have. It definitely presents many arguments, but I wouldn't be in a driverless car even if it was my only choice. I wouldn't want my life in the hands of a technological device or machine or whatever it'd be called. 		0
 An Argumentative Essay: The Face on Mars is Just a Natural Landform  Introduction: The face on Mars is a fascinating topic that has generated a lot of excitement and speculation. The face was first spotted in 1977 by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft and has since become a source of intense scientific interest and debate. While there are many theories about the origin of the face, including the possibility that it was created by aliens, in this essay, I will argue that the face on Mars is just a natural landform.  Body: For starters, let's consider the evidence presented in the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" by NASA scientists. According to the article, the face on Mars is actually a large crater that was formed by a meteor impact several billion years ago. The article reveals that the face is composed of billions of rocks and boulders that have slumped and slid down the side of the crater and created a smooth, circular face-like formation. Additionally, the article notes that the face exhibits the same geological features as other craters on Mars, such as rays and moats, indicating that it is a natural formation similar to others on the planet.  Furthermore, the article suggests that the face on Mars was formed by similar geological processes that have created other natural landforms on Mars, such as canyons and mountains. The article notes that the face is located at the highest elevation on Mars and is surrounded by volcanic formations, further evidence that the face was formed by geological processes.  Finally, the article raises an interesting point about the possibility of extraterrestrial activity on Mars. While there is evidence of water and life on the planet, there is no evidence of intelligent life or of human intervention on the face. This is a critical point, as it suggests that the face is a natural landform and that there is no need to invoke the possibility of extraterrestrial intervention as an explanation.  Conclusion: In conclusion, the face on Mars is just a natural landform, formed by the impact of a meteor and shaped by geological processes similar to those that have created other natural landforms on the planet. The geological evidence presented in the article suggests that the face is a natural landform, and the lack of evidence of intelligent life or human intervention on the face further strengthens this argument. While the face on Mars remains a fascinating topic, it is important to recognize that it is a natural landform and that there is no need to invoke the possibility of extraterrestrial intervention as an explanation.   In conclusion, the face on Mars is just a landform, not an alien creation. The evidence supports this claim, and it is a crucial aspect of the ongoing scientific exploration of the planet. To date, no irrefutable evidence has been found to suggest that the face was created by extraterrestrial life.		1
Technology has changed a lot of ways that we live today. Nowadays we have phones that can recogonize our faces by just looking at it, anyone could make any facial expression by looking at their phone and it will set it as a passcode and in which phones are protected from other people that try to get into it. Having a computer that recgonizes is an outstanding piece of work, and as younger kids get much older they will be able to learn about how technology has improved the way of living. Students in this era may have some kind interest in going into computer science or go into anything that has to do with technology.  The use of technology that can read facial expressions is remarkable. Students will be absolutely amazed of how a computer can show wheather the person is either happy, confused, sad, or angry. Students can use the facial expression software to find out how they are feeling. For instince in paragraph 6 the author states "If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different (par.6)." In this quote the author clearly explains how amazingly smart a comupter can be. Being able to develop that technology is one of a kind. The author also stated in paragraph 6, video games and video surgery technology works the same way, for example many students enjoy playing video games in their spare time, and if they are into a game they are really into, the technology and software bulit into the game will able to show the audience the characters expression inside of the game.  Moving foward, the famous painting of Mona Lisa may seem like she is 100 percent smiling right? Wrong. The famous painting has had many people have conterversal arguments about her facial expression, thinking she is serious or smiling. According to the author, they explain  "She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry (par.1)." This shows how much techonlogy has improved during the past years. Having new software that can inform students the real expression on someone's face through face to face or through a picture or painting is insane. Teachers will be able to ask their studnets how people are feeling by they way they express their emotion, and show them the actual feeling behind the expression.  Futhermore, students can have an idea of how the way technology works and how it is set up. Being able to work with technology that can show statistics the way people express their feelings is outstanding. In paragraph 9, the author explains how the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion explains how a person's facial muscle moves while they express the way they are feeling. It also states that it can even help produce the emotion while peforming the facial expression "According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them (par.9)."  In conclusion, studnets that have accsess to this advanced technology that can read expressions is valuable and worth keeping in the future. Not only will it amuse the students but it can also help them learn about the new improvements that are being created while they get older. Technology is becoming a much more valuable, powerful tool and helping change the way we live and how we view technology.         		0
Car emissions are very deadly and dangerous. They can be lethal to humans, and also dangerous to the environment. It can lead to big environmental issues like global warming, holes in the ozone, and air pollution. Many ignore the fact or are oblivious to it, but driving hurts our environment just for a little bit of convenience. Are cars doing more harm than good?  Cars have a convenient way of getting us to our destination faster but at the cost of our precious environment. We use our cars sometimes without thinking twice of what the actual after effect is. Paris is a city that has had almost, if not the worst, smog levels in all of europe. It has 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter due to the majority of cars which have diesel powered engines. Air pollution doen't just effect our atmosphere, it slowly kills, if not severly injures, animals and people. It hurts us by causing major damage to our lungs and respiratory system.  Greenhouse gases are another major thing in car emissions. Greenhouse gases are gases that keep or trap heat on earth to keep us from going into another ice age. A decent amount is good and is used to do its job, but when you have too much then the globe starts to increase in temperature. Antarctica, as you know, is made of ice. when ice gets to a certain temperature it starts to turn into a liquid. So when antarctica starts to melt into the sea, the general ocean level will rise, causing sea level cities, states, and countries start to flood with salty ocean water. If we cut down on gas or diesel car travels, the and greenhouse production rate would slow down and so will the rising temperature of the earth decreasing the speed of the melting arctic.  Cars are a very important and convenient way of travel but can be very deadly to us humans and tne earth we live on. Because we use them everyday doesn't mean that we can not cut down or change our ways of transpertation. Cars give off many harmful toxins and gases that we can, but refuse to control. we can cut down on the majority of the waste by limiting our car trips distance wise and based on how many times you leave the driveway. a simple change as in riding a bike or walking or even only going out when needed can slow down the speed of global warming and even drop the levels of air pollution. A little change can maybe just save the earth from another flood that can wipe out humainity.		0
Scientists and more specifically astronomers are extremley fascinated in Earth's sister planet, Venus, as it is similar to Earth in certain ways, and is a close enough distance for travel. Venus was believed to once be very similar to Earth in terms of its geology, so therefore scientists are interested in discovering how the features have changed. However, the author of "The Challenge Exploring Venus," explains the great dangers that the planet offers for both humans and technology to explore the planet. The act of returning to Venus seems impossible due to the risks, although the insight that is wanted to be gained on the planet could lead to "intimidating endeavors." The author claims that the studying of Venus is still an active pursuit despite the dangers that come along with it. The claim is supported well by using previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics that catch the readers attention.  The author tells the story of previous missions that have been sent to Venus in hopes to persuade the audience that the planet's harsh conditions are too intense for even high technology to withstand. He mentions, "...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades." This quote uses ethos to ensure the reliablity of the author, and to emphasize that scientists are truly struggling to develop devices that are well enough developed to explains the dangers. The understanding that technology made by scientists who have succesfully researched across the milky way cannot withstand Venus's circumstanes demonstrates how dangerous the planet is.  The use of statistics is presented by the author to take a more logical view on their argument to prove the dangers of Venus. The article mentions that "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent blankets Venus." As carbon dioxide is waste product of human respiration, the inhalation of this gas would be very dangerous for life to visit Venus. It also says that "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." Without shelter that can withold these extreme temperatures and amounts of pressure, the human body, similar to the spacecrafts, would be lucky to survive for more than a few hours. These numbers support the author's claim to focus on the horrific dangerous of exploring Venus to present a logical standpoint on this issue.  Throughout the article, it suggests that studying Venus is still a worthy mission for astronomers, however, the dangers that come along with these missions are extremely dangerous and life-threatening. The author mentions the curiosity that scientists have involving Earth's sister planet, and the desire to still visit Venus regardless of the harsh conditions. With the article's use of both previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics of Venus, the claim is very strongly supported with evidence.             		0
The Face is on Mars, Im a Scientist at NASA and, I can tell you that the Face is no Alien artifact. It is a landform of its own just like our Earth makes its own landforms like lakes, rivers, hills, ect. This Face had became a big pop icon. It started in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio and even talk shows. Some people think the Face is bona find evidence of life on Mars.  "Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." This illusion is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude. The so called "face" is not a face it is not a alien monument artifact at all this is just made by the plant.  Some scientists beliveved the Face was an alien artifact. Latter of they founded out that it was not. When up an took a better photoghraph of the "face". What the picture actuallshws is the Martian equivalant of a butte or mesa-landforms. The landform is just a landfor nothing special to it at all. The "face" is just an illusion.		0
In this essay im going to prove to you why that electorial colleges should be gotten rid of. i think that elections should be won by popular vote.  With Electorial Colleges what the public wants or voted for really just doesnt matter because if the majority of the Electorial College disagrees well then the majority vote is irrelevant to the election and the canidate that the Electorial College voted on will will the election. " The Electorial college is unfair, outdated, and irrational." I comepletely agree with that statement. the Electorial colleges are not dermocratic at all and when you vote for a presidential canidate well you're actually voting for a slate of electors. the Electorial College is also an unfair way to determine our president because well each state has a different number of Electorial College votes. Each state should have an equal amount of Electors to make it at least somewhat fair; its still unfair because of the fact that they can always out vote the popular vote from the citizens. when the Electorial College decides to out vote the actual winner that becomes problematic to the citizens because now a canidate that the majority of America didnt want to become president is now president and that can be problematic because the people may become angry or upset in some way because a canidate they felt didnt stand for a good cause or that was unfit to run the country is now in charge. also like what is the point of letting the people vote for who they want to become president if their vote may not even matter or make a difference because the Electorial College is going to do what they want anyways.        ¬†    		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I would just like to say that I think changing the policy is a bad idea for many reasons. One reason would be because, most students play sports to get things off their minds to make the grades they are. Plus taking things they enjoy away will just stress them out and make them mad of course you may still think this is a good solution but us children think differently. The people that play sports will find a way to one way or another. Lest they be heard they will revolt and take action. Also if many students have a C average then we would just not have very good and mighty teams you might as well take out all sports and just say we aren't going to have any sports but then if you did that I could almost ensure you that we would only have people at our school that could care less about sports which is very few. Now if you changed the policy where students with a C average could play then that would be efficient and reasonable because C is passing and I think everyone could agree with if you don't have a C average then you shouldn't play. Another reason why I don't agree is because we would have a lot more fights most scholars play sports to get their anger out and so that would just cause even more conflicts and then it would go to suspension and so on and so forth. I really hope you understand what I am trying to say and take my advice into deep consideration then maybe our school will be more successful.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME :)		0
Texting While Driving  Texting while driving is not good. Some people text their friends while driving and some people text for work on the road. Other people text while driving to save time.  More people have phones now and they are using them constantly. That means that texting while driving has also increased. Texting while driving should be against the law because it is causing more injuries and deaths than before cell phones were invented.  Texting while driving is dangerous. Texting while driving is one of the main causes of traffic accidents on the road. Studies have shown that cell phone texting is the cause of 1.6 million crashes every year, with 330,000 people injured in them ( tellrobert). There are probably thousands more accidents that are not reported because many drivers hide this information from the police. Injuries are not the only problem. Many people are dying because of texting while driving too. One study found that in 2016, 3,450 deaths were a result of texting while driving and is the leading preventable cause of death among teenagers now (Christopher ). The number of injuries and deaths alone is enough reason texting while driving should be against the law.  Surprisingly, there are still people out there texting and driving. These people believe that they are responsible enough to avoid wrecks and crashes (debate). Others think that since they are Americans they should be able to have the freedom to choose (debate). They think that they are above the rules . It is unfortunate that these people still text and drive when the consequences are so high.  Texting while driving has proven to be dangerous for everyone. The people who do it think they are bigger and better than other people. But why should their rights be more important than the rights of other people on the road? Shouldn't the other people on the road have the right to be protected, too? Is a text more important than a life?  Work Cited  Christopher.

 Facial action coding system is a method of encoding emotions in facial expressions. This system is based on the idea that facial expressions are an important part of communication and that there are specific expressions associated with different emotions. The facial action coding system was developed by Paul Ekman, a psychologist who has studied the way people express emotions for many years.  The system is based on the idea that there are six basic emotions that are expressed in facial expressions: happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, and disgust. Each of these emotions is associated with a specific set of facial expressions. For example, when someone is happy, they typically smile broadly, raise their eyebrows, and wrinkle their face. When someone is angry, they typically frown, open their mouth, and raise their eyebrows.  The facial action coding system can be used to understand the emotions that people are feeling in any given situation. It can also be used to train people to recognize and respond appropriately to different emotional states. For example, a therapist might use the system to help their patients recognize when they are feeling a particular emotion and respond in a way that is appropriate for that emotion.  In addition to the six basic emotions, the system also includes expressions for more specific emotions such as contempt, pride, and shame. These expressions are more complex and can be difficult to recognize unless someone is familiar with them.  The facial action coding system has been used in a variety of fields, including social psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience. It has also been used in the development of computer games and virtual reality simulations.  Overall, the facial action coding system is a powerful way of understanding and communicating emotions. It is a valuable tool for therapists, researchers, and anyone who is interested in understanding human behavior. The system has the potential to bring about greater empathy and		1
For those who believe in Aliens, and believe this face is built by aliens, I have some news, its not and i can argue my point in three different ways. Number one, paragrah 10 sates that if there were anything on the ground the camera would of caught it, number 2 is paragrah 11 talks about the cameras ablity to see anything that would help the research of alien life, and lastly paragrah 7 talking about the natural landform.  First, paragrah 10 talks about the difference of the pictures from 1976-2001 with the different pixels. In the fourth sentence it says " Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo". Earlier in the paragraph it talks about the camera being at its ablsoulte maximum resolution, meaning the camera NASA has aren't cheap, they are high quality and could see anything that could resemble any alien life, which will be disccused next.  Secondly, in paragraph 11 it talks about the cameras ablity to see anything on the ground such as shacks planes, as is I said in the previous paragraph with the camera being at its ablsoulte maximum resolution, this paragrah also says "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size," he added."So, if there objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground Egyptian- style prymaids or even small shacks, acould see what they were!" Which brings us back to the camera being its best of class,if the camera is able to see anything on the ground that would not be visable to the naked eye, then why didn't it see anythng .  I know most of you would argue that they are storing equiment in the face. But, in the picture the only holes are the eyes and the camera could of seen any other entry point at this angle.  Lastly, paragraph 7 revells the picture of the face on mars, this paragraph talks about the research, and the release of the picture. Yes this eariler in the story but it all falls into place, they state they snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original picture, the image was first posted on the JPL webstite showing a NATURAL land form, no alien momument at all. This dosen't ptove anything since they just posted the picture, but the previous statement i made fall into place with this one supporting my facts of no alien life on the palnet mars asscociating with the face  Concluding my argument of no other life form on mars, I hope I one helped you with your facts, changed your idea of the other life form (not saying you have to). I do not 100% disagree with other life forms but for this one I do.		0
This sounds like a great idea because teachers wouldn't have to worry about getting around to everyone in the classroom, re-teaching the same lesson, trying to figure out what activities/ lesson can help the kids understand more but this could aslo be a big distraction.  I think that the use of this technology to read students expressions is valueable because whatever lesson it is being taught if the student is bored or confused it will modify the lesson. I think this is very useful because as a student i know that when a lesson is boring or not interesting its hard for me to pay attention or get focused. So the fact that it could tell that im not really into it or getting it and it'll change itself to something more "my style" is great. I know that teachers can't be everywhere at once to help or make you understand so when you're at you desk with your hand up waiting on the teacher to get to you probably frustrated by the now the computer will sense it and help you out before your teacher has to see you. This also helps by saving time in the class rooms because somethings not every student will get right away and instead of the teacher re-teaching it over and over the computer will see that your not getting it and change the lesson to something a little more complex, that you get and understand.  Now as much as i am with this idea, a downfall could be students getting too carried away with it. Even though we are in high school kids can still be a little immitaure, this could be a distraction to the kids. They'll try to play with the sytem by making the wrong facial expression on purpose to see if the computer could guess how they're feeling. This could take away from valueable class time. 		0
People say that the face figure on mars is made by aliens. That hypothosis is not true because aliens do not excist. This figure on mars can be made by a human or it can be made by natural causes on the planet. as you can see in the pictures the face in 1976 it is full and the one in the second picture is half way gone the third picture it is almost completetly gone. if this figure is made by humans it did not last very long. If this figure is mad eby natural causes on the planet it has faded away over the years. Most people around the world think this figure is made by aliens, This figure could have been made by the astronauts on the ships and they just made a figure and took a picture of it and made people think that it was made by aliens. This figure could have been made not even on the planet they could have took some clay or some other material and made a rock like face and said that they found it on the planet. This figure is probably a fake because how often do you go to a planet and just find a random rock that looks like a face. If this figure is real then they need to take another picture and put it up. If they do take another picture it has to have the shuttle to where you can see it so the people around the world can say it is in space. If there really is a face figure on that planet that might be a sign of life on the planet. Maybe the astronauts have found another planet with life it may not be human it may be im not saying that aliens are real but if there is life on that planet this whole world will be wanting to go up there and see for themselves. If there is life on that planet then people will pay big money to go up,also if theres life maybe we will go back up there and their might be another face figure. If you look at the first picturre and the second picture you can see that the eyes are in differnet spots so thses pictures might actually be fake.		0
 Car-free cities have been a topic of discussion for many years now. Some cities have already implemented this concept, and some are considering it. The idea of a car-free city is to create a city where cars are prohibited or severely limited in use, with people relying on other modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transportation. The advantages of creating a car-free city are numerous, including improved health and safety, reduced pollution, and a more livable environment.  One of the main advantages of a car-free city is the improvement of public health. A study conducted in Aalborg, Denmark, found that people who lived in a car-free city had a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and other health issues. This is because walking or cycling to work or school is a great source of exercise that can help people maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.  In addition to improved health, a car-free city also improves safety. Cars can be dangerous, especially in densely populated areas where accidents can happen quickly. In a car-free city, people would rely on other modes of transportation, which are generally safer than cars. For instance, walking or cycling can be slower but provides an opportunity for people to observe their surroundings and avoid accidents.  Another advantage of a car-free city is that it helps reduce pollution. Cars are a significant source of air pollution, and a car-free city would reduce the amount of emissions that are released into the air. This would lead to a cleaner, healthier environment for people living in the city. Additionally, a car-free city would reduce the amount of noise pollution caused by cars, creating a more peaceful environment.  Finally, a car-free city would improve the livability of the environment. Cities with a lot of cars can be overwhelming, and people may feel disconnected from their community. In a car-free city, people would have more opportunities to interact with each other and engage in social activities. This would make the city more vibrant and enjoyable to live in.  In conclusion, a car-free city has numerous advantages, from improved health and safety to a more livable environment. While creating a car-free city may have its challenges, the benefits it can bring to a city are significant. More cities should consider implementing this concept and work towards a more sustainable future.		1
In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger well by telling the reader what happens in Venus and giving details about the benifits of Venus. In paragraph 4 the author used words to make the reader take its head off of Venus being an dangerous planet and how scientists are discussing futher visits to its surface. The author states, "astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planer in our solar system. The author mentioned this in the article because he wanted to let readers know that even the people who go on Venus come back to be suprised about the things Venus has in the solar system. Also another reason why the author supports the idea that studyimng Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is stating how NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. He states this because he wants us to know how focus these people are on Venus. He gives the people who are intrested in traveling planets details about what projects are being made, devices that are going to make the studies of Venus better and testing out Venus's surface seeing how long it was lasted. Finally, in the last paragraph, the author makes an influence about how audience shouldn't really worry about the dangers of Venus when traveling and look how good it could be. In the paragraph he said, " Our travels on Earthand beyond should not be limited by dangers an doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. In conclusion, the author uses great details about supporting the idea that studying Venus is outcomings of it that are benifical are good even with the dangers it presents. 		0
some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home or from video conferencing. I think learning from home can be very helpful to some students especially if students have a hard time being at school or struggle in certain things. Working from home could also be a lot¬†less stressful and students could actually have more times to get things done.  benefits from working from home is students won't be to distracted because they won't have others bothering them while they get there work done. It could help some kids because a lot struggle with anxiety and it becomes a little bit harder for some students when they have to talk in front of the class, taking a test, or when a teacher calls on them when there hand wasn't raised. Also students working from home won't have to worry about certain kids bullying them or making fun of what there wearing or how they look.  Although working from home can also have some cons. Students won't get to interact with other students, won't have the opportunity to do school activities, and might have trouble finding friends or a place to fit in. Students working from home won't get to experience certain things that go on in the class room. Teachers could making students do a fun learning activity even in science students get to do lab experiments. Also some classes will even go on field trips to certain places. A lot of things go on in school and a lot of those things you can't do from home so you may feel a little left out.  i wonder if students are still a loud to play in a school sport or if they get to attend the school dances like homecoming and prom. If a student has a choice to work from home do they have to pay for books that they might need or will the school offer them for free. Kids that go to school have to get up at a specific time so does that mean kids that stay home school get to sleep in or gt up at a specific time. some kids might want this option but also there parents work and might not won't there kid home alone all day.  However, having class at home i think is a great idea and definitely should be and option especially if kids dont really like school. Having school at home might have some pros and cons but its also a big choice to make and maybe something to consider and if you are worried about sending your kid to school. You always wanna make sure what things are best for your kid and if these things will help in the future to make you and them happy.¬†		0
As a student, has your learning process ever been impeded by your emotional state? Have you ever wished a teacher could read your mind? The article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" is about a new software system called the Facial Action Coding System which can detect emotions based on facial movements. Technology such as the Facial Action Coding Systems can be valuable in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom and sensing varying degrees of boredom, confusion, or sadness; this data can then be used to create better fit lessons for the students.  To begin, Prof. Thomas Huang and his team have been working to develop ways for robots to better communicate with people. The Facial Action Coding System, which calculates movement of all 44 major muscles on your face, was created. These movements can be used to classify happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.  First, in a classtoom setting, this system could be used to detect whether a student is bored with a lesson plan. The lesson plan could then be changed. Next, the Facial Action Coding System could also be used to detect if a student is confused. This data could indicate that a student may need additional help with a lesson or an alternate lesson plan. Lastly, another emotion the Facial ACtion Coding System could help with is sadness. If the system dectects that a student is constantly sad, the school administration can look into this and verify that the student is emotionally stable.  For many students, a poor emotional state as well as confusion and boredom, impede their ability to learn in school. In a classroom setting, a Facial Action Coding System would be beneficial to detect a student's current emotion and adjust the lesson plan accordingly.             		0
Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:  Curfews: Keeping Teens Out of Trouble or Interfering with Their Lives?  Hey, so I know curfews are a thing that adults like to implement, but are they really necessary? Like, I get it, they want to keep us safe and all, but they can also be super unfair. So, let's break it down.  First, what are curfews? They're like, rules that say you gotta be home by a certain time. Like, my mom has a curfew of 10 PM on weekdays, and 11 PM on weekends. But why? Why do adults get to decide when we can and can't be out? It's not like they have to deal with the consequences of breaking the curfew.  Okay, so some people say curfews keep us out of trouble. Like, if we're not allowed to be out late, we won't get into fights or do drugs or anything bad. But, like, that's not always true. I know people who have gotten into trouble even when they're supposed to be home by curfew. It's like, curfews don't always work.  And, like, curfews can be really unfair. Like, what if you have a late night at school or a sports game? You can't just go home early because of a curfew. It's like, adults don't understand that we have stuff to do too. And what if you're the only one who can take care of your younger siblings? You can't just leave them home alone because of a curfew.  So, I think curfews can be beneficial in some ways, but they can also be really unfair. Like, they can keep us safe, but they can also interfere with our lives. It's like, adults need to understand that we're not just kids, we're people too. And we deserve to have some freedom.  In conclusion, curfews are like, a thing that adults do to keep us		1
I think that schools should not allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. First of all, it's like, invasion of privacy, you know? Like, students should have some privacy and not have their parents breathing down their necks all the time. It's like, trust issues, you feel me?  And also, it's not like parents are always right, you know? Like, they might be biased or something. They might be like, "Oh, my child would never do that!" But what if they did? Like, parents should not be the ones to judge their children's work. That's the teacher's job, you know?  And it's not like it's gonna help students, either. Like, if parents are always checking their grades, students are gonna feel pressure, you know? They're gonna be like, "Oh, I gotta get good grades or my parents will kill me!" And that's not cool, you feel me? It's like, stressful, man.  And also, like, what if a student is absent? Like, they might be absent for a good reason, you know? Like, they were sick or something. But if their parents see that they're absent, they might be like, "What's wrong with you? Why weren't you in school?" And that's not fair, you know?  So, like, in conclusion, schools should not allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. It's like, privacy issues, man. And it's not gonna help students, either. It's just gonna cause stress and stuff. So, yeah, that's my opinion.		1
In recent years, there has been a growing movement to promote car-free living. This is due to a number of factors, including the increasing cost of cars and gas, the environmental impact of car emissions, and the health risks associated with sedentary lifestyles.  There are a number of advantages to living car-free. One of the most obvious is financial savings. The cost of owning and operating a car is significant, and it can be a major burden for many people. Car-free living can save you money on car payments, insurance, gas, parking, and maintenance.  Another advantage of car-free living is that it is good for the environment. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and they contribute to climate change. By living car-free, you can help to reduce your environmental impact.  Finally, car-free living can be good for your health. When you drive, you are often sedentary for long periods of time. This can lead to obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. Car-free living can help you to get more exercise and stay healthy.  There are a number of ways to live car-free. One option is to live in a walkable or bikeable neighborhood. This will allow you to get around without a car. Another option is to use public transportation. Many cities have excellent public transportation systems that can take you anywhere you need to go.  If you live in a car-dependent area, there are still ways to reduce your car usage. You can carpool, take public transportation, or walk or bike for short trips. You can also use a car-sharing service, which allows you to rent a car when you need one.  Car-free living can be a challenge, but it is also very rewarding. It can save you money, reduce your environmental impact, and improve your health. If you are considering living car-free, I encourage you to give it a try. You may be surprised at how easy and enjoyable it can be.  In addition to the advantages mentioned above, car-free living can also have a positive impact on your social life. When you live car-free, you are more likely to walk, bike, or take public transportation to get around. This means that you will have more opportunities to interact with your neighbors and community members. You may also find that you make new friends who share your interest in living a sustainable lifestyle.  If you are interested in learning more about car-free living, there are a number of resources available online and in your community. You can join a car-free living group, read books and articles about the topic, or attend workshops and events. With a little planning and effort, you can make the switch to car-free living and enjoy all of the benefits it has to offer.		1
Cars are going to be gone in the near future. There have been talks and actions taken place to assure we limit our car usage. We as the  United States seem to have pasted our use for cars as independent owners. We have also started several different programs or actions around the world to assure we stop pollution with the use of cars. Another way we have stop the use of car is car free days in some parts of the world. Also cars are believe to be stressful to human beings.  In some parts of the world mainly Bogota, Colombia they have start to reduce the use of cars to avoid pollution and promote the use of other types of transportation. As it is stated in source 3  :  Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Selsky " The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."¬† This quote goes to show how we are starting to try to limit the usage of vehicles in this world. Also stated in source 2  :  Paris bans driving due to smog by Duffer "Paris enforced a partial diving ban to clean the air of the global city. On Monday motorists wit even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day." this shows that Paris even supports the limiting car usages by humans.  Therefore us as the United States we have shown that even we are behind in our glory days of driving cars. As stated in source 4  :  The End of Car Culture by Rosenthal " recent studies suggest that Americans as buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by." So with that have been said we need to understand we drive no matter what but slow but surely we will stop driving in general. Due to the fact of that we do need to decrease our carbon release a pond the world. As it also states from article 4  or source 4  "If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind the power plant." This quote shows how it will affect us and also how it will benefit us as well.  Although driving feels amazing it gives you tons of stress to an individual. Not only that but it also makes you sometimes want to hurt someone. As well as feeling upset and sometimes wanting to cry due to a lack of funds to pay for gas as well as the worry of other drivers on the road. As stated in source 1  :  In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Rosenthal a man states "when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," said Heidrun Walter. This goes to show us how we are affected by riving and even a little time away from the wheel can benefit us greatly. Another point on driving is stressful a man states in source 3  :  Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota he¬† states It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." said Carlos Arturo Plaza. This goes and show a lot of people are in support of this act or idea.  In conclusion limiting car use will benefit us in many ways but barely affect us at all. The main idea is to limit car usage and we can do that by the law that forces us stop car use in general. Another way we can accomplish this is by being an average teen in the United States.¬† An added bonus is that we have loads of stress by driving. The limiting the use of driving is a way we should use to benefit us as human and to be more joyful.    ¬†    		0
 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a numerical system that uses numerical values (FACS codes) to categorize and analyze facial movements, expressions, and gestures. It was developed in the 1970s by Paul Ekman, Wallace V. Friesen, and Wallace F. Schiller.  FACS codes are based on the observation that certain facial movements and expressions are associated with specific underlying muscle activities. By recording the facial movements and expressions of an individual, researchers can identify the underlying muscle activities associated with those movements and expressions. For example, a smile is associated with the activation of several muscles in the face, including those around the eyes and mouth.  FACS codes are used in a number of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and forensic science. They have been used to study the neural mechanisms underlying emotional processing, to develop new treatments for mental health disorders, and to analyze the accuracy of eyewitness testimony.  One application of FACS is in the field of neuroscience. By recording the facial movements and expressions of individuals while they are performing different tasks, researchers can identify the specific muscle activities associated with those tasks. This information can then be used to develop models of how the brain processes information and to study the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive and motor processes.  FACS has also been used in the field of forensic science. By analyzing the facial expressions of an individual at the time of a crime, Forensic experts can use FACS codes to identify the emotions that person may have been experiencing at the time. This information can be used to help identify suspects or to exonerate innocent individuals.  In conclusion, Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a valuable tool for studying and analyzing facial movements, expressions, and gestures. It has many applications in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and forensic science, where it can be used to identify the underlying muscle activities associated with facial expressions, to study the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive and motor processes, and to identify the emotions that people may have been experiencing at the time of a crime.		1
 The image of a cowboy on horseback, roaming the vast plains of the American West, is a classic and enduring image that has captured the imagination of people around the world. But what many people may not know is that cowboys were not limited to land-based activities. In fact, there were many cowboys who rode the waves, making a living as surfers in California during the early 20th century.  One of these cowboys was Duke Kahanamoku, who was dubbed "The Father of Modern Surfing." Born in Hawaii in 1890, Kahanamoku was a natural athlete who excelled at swimming, surfing, and other water sports. After winning several gold medals in swimming at the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Kahanamoku decided to move to California to pursue his passion for surfing.  Kahanamoku quickly became one of the most famous surfers in the world, known for his exceptional skill and natural grace on the waves. He competed in surfing competitions and made hundreds of movies featuring surfing, which helped to popularize the sport and bring it to a wider audience.  But despite his fame as a surfer, Kahanamoku was still a cowboy at heart. He had grown up in the cowboy culture of Hawaii, where horsemanship and rodeo were an integral part of daily life. Kahanamoku was known for his love of horses, and he often spent his free time riding and training his horses.  In addition to his surfing and horseback riding, Kahanamoku was also an accomplished musician and a vocalist. He often performed on stage, singing cowboy songs and entertaining audiences with his lively performances.  Overall, Duke Kahanamoku was a true cowboy who was able to find success and fulfillment in a variety of different pursuits. From his early successes in swimming to his love of surfing and his passion for horses, Kahanamoku was a true Renaissance man who left a lasting impact on the world.  In conclusion, the image of a cowboy on horseback may be iconic, but it's important to remember that cowboys were not limited to land-based activities. In fact, many cowboys, like Duke Kahanamoku, found success and fulfillment in the water as well. Kahanamoku's dedication to his various pursuits and his ability to blend different aspects of his identity make him a true inspiration for anyone seeking to pursue a diverse range of interests.		1
 Limiting car usage is an effective way to reduce air pollution. According to the passage set, air pollution poses a significant threat to the health of all citizens. It is responsible for respiratory diseases, such as asthma and bronchitis, and can cause serious health issues in humans. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease the amount of air pollution and improve the overall health of our citizens.  In addition to improving air quality, limiting car usage can also help to reduce traffic congestion. According to the passage set, traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities and can cause significant delays for drivers. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce traffic congestion and make it easier for people to get where they need to go.  There are also economic benefits to limiting car usage. According to the passage set, the cost of owning and operating a car can be significant, and many families struggle to afford it. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce the cost of transportation for families and make it more affordable for them to get where they need to go.  Finally, limiting car usage can also help to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. According to the passage set, we currently import a large amount of oil from other countries, which can put a strain on our economy and our national security. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and make our country more energy independent.  In conclusion, limiting car usage is an effective way to reduce air pollution, reduce traffic congestion, and reduce our reliance on foreign oil. It can also help to reduce the cost of transportation for families. For these reasons, it is important for us to limit our car usage and encourage others to do the same.		1
The Electoral Colleage is not a Colleage like it sounds, but it is a process. It is a verry complex process and sofar since our government was started it is working fine, right? Well you are wrong. First, let me give a brief explanation what the electoral College is. It is a process that our government has ben using for a very long time that was started in the constitution. What it does, Each state has a number of people in it pledged to a president, such as Obama. When the people vote, it goes to those people and then they vote on who got the majority. Sometimes, this docent work. Some of these "people" dont stick to their pledge and vote for someone els, like if 70% of the votes were for Bill, he is supposto vote for Bill. He docent half to and can vote for Bob instead, and this is the big problem with tis method.  florida has 29 people representing it. Places such as California and Texas have 55, and 38, But if you look at places such as hawaii and Alaska, they have around 3 or voters. They have less voters because there population is less than the places with higher amounts of voters. Here is another problem, the bigger states like Texas, California, florida, etc. have a MASSIVE advantage over these places with less people. I believe that votes should be directly by how many people choose someone and whoever gets the higher vote, wins. It's WAY simpler than the way currently used and the more simple something is, the less problems occur.  One argument agenst this way of "the higher vote wins" is that it is possible that the votes are so close that there is no clear winner, but with the current way, if there is a tie in the electoral colleage, then it goes to the peoples votes. In 1968, if just 41,71 votes would have made it a tie, and thats extremely close. Dont YOU want to vote for the president, or would you rather vote for someone to vote for ho you want and they could be corrupt and vote for the opposite that they are supposto vote for wich has happened.  If people decided to rid of this mess of a voting system called "The Electoral College", wich would be a big leap to accomplish due to the ammount of supporters, would be a great accomplashment. It would also lead to those 29 people in flordia living off of doing practicly nothing and getting money having to get a real job to get money. These would be the people that try and not get rid of it and tell the good parts of it and most likley lie like most government people do, all so they can get money, withought doing practicly anything. In the 2000's, Al Gore recieved more votes than his opponent, George Bush. Bush wone even though more people wanted gore, and this happened because the Electoral College gave Bush more votes, making him win the election. Dosent is seem wrong that the people wanted Gore, but we still got Bush?  Not all of these people working in the Electoral College are like this though, Some might actuially believe it's a good idea to keep it and are a part of it not for the money. When people advertise for who to vote for, they dont advertise in Alaska or Rhode island, They advertise to the states with the most Electoral Colleage members are, such as florida, Texas, and California.		0
So in my opinion, I am definantely for the development of driverless cars.  I find they will be useful in the future for these reasons: 1) They will most likely cause less wrecks. 2) The will probably be safer for the community. 3) They might bring new ideas to the table.  I find that these three reasons will bring a positive outlook on driverless cars. I do however have one problem with driverless cars: carelessness, but i will explain my reasoning later.  I think driverless cars will be the future.  So as i said in my first reasoning, they will most likely cause less wrecks.  I say this because if everyone had a driverless car, the the programming in the cars will mostlikely correspond with each other and (in my thinking) they will react to each other as they get close to one another to prevent any damage that comes up.  This leads to my second reason why i think thety should keep working on driverless cars, it ill probably be better for the community.  Like i said, if the cars can correspond and react to each other, thanthey will have a greater chance of not hitting each other and causing less injuries to cars, the driver and passengers, and pedestrians.  This could definantely decrease injuries by cars per year and could possibly save thousands upon thousands of lives.  This is of course a goos thing and if driverless cars could prevent this, then i'm pretty sure anyone would approve and want this car.  Now my second reason for why driverless cars is a good idea and should be promoted is because this might bring new ideas to the table of creativity if you want to call it.  The reason i say this is because if they can create cars that drive on their own without human needs, then this might spark some new ideas for new inventions (doesn't have to all be car related in my opinion).  Like they could be at the verge of creating inventions that people might have never thought of before.  Now i know it does seem like that i'm getting a bit off track about the driverless cars thing, but for a second, just imagine all the possibilities that could come out of driverless cars and their technology.  This could bring about ideas one could only dream about.  This could be a serious change to the world as it is if companies can bring fully driverless cars to the world.  Now for the reason why I think that driverless cars might not be a good idea in the first place: carelessness.  Now what I mean by that is mostly two reasons: 1) problem with the technology.  2) Problem with the person behind the wheel.  About the problem with technology, If the company who makes the car provides a misshap with the technology they used to make the car, then there might be a problam when time passes along while driving the car.  Like there could be a miscommunication with the cars (Assuming that everyone has a driverless car with the same or somewhat similar technology that correspond with each other.), there could be a problem with the way it works if not made the way it should be, and the list could go on forever.  Now to the other negative of this reason, the person who is behind the wheel of the driverless car.  What I mean is that the person who is behind the wheel of the driverless car could cuase a problem with the inside or outside of that car like: Mess around with the controls, damage a part of the car through human or nature contact, shortage of a wire or battery or whatever is in or out of the car, and this list has almost unlimited downsides to it, but hopefully you understand my point.  So as I said, driverless cars in my opinion will become the future if made at all.  There is a certainty at the rate this world is going today because people these days have many ideas to come.  I know that there will be more problems to come, but as the saying goes "There is always a solution to every problem", and i think that people or companies that are creating this type of machinery knows that there will be new problems that they will have to overcome.  I hope to see them grow and possibly be on the market for the consumers to purchase and experience real and true driverless cars.		0
 Car-free cities are cities that have eliminated the use of private cars, and instead rely on alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transport. The idea of a car-free city is becoming increasingly popular, and for good reason. With the rise of air pollution, traffic congestion, and climate change, cities around the world are exploring ways to reduce their reliance on cars and create more sustainable modes of transportation.  One of the main benefits of a car-free city is the improvement in air quality. Cars are one of the biggest contributors to air pollution, and reducing the number of cars on the road can significantly reduce air pollution. A study conducted in Copenhagen, Denmark, found that reducing car usage in the city led to a 30% reduction in nitrogen dioxide, a common component of air pollution.  Another benefit of a car-free city is the reduction in traffic congestion. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of traffic congestion, and with fewer cars on the road, there is less congestion. This can lead to shorter commute times, reduced stress levels, and fewer lost productivity.  Car-free cities can also promote physical activity and reduce sedentary lifestyles. Walking and cycling are great forms of exercise, and they can be incorporated into daily routines in a car-free city. This can lead to improved health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.  Finally, car-free cities can be more sustainable and eco-friendly. With fewer cars on the road, there is less demand for fossil fuels, which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. Additionally, car-free cities can have more green spaces and less concrete, which can improve the quality of life for residents.  Despite the benefits of a car-free city, there are concerns about how people will get around if they don't have their own cars. However, there are plenty of alternative modes of transportation available, such as public transport, bike share programs, and car-sharing services. These modes of transportation can provide convenient and affordable options for people who want to get around without a car.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a number of benefits, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, increased physical activity, and sustainability. As the world becomes more conscious of the need for sustainable living, car-free cities will likely become more popular. While there may be concerns about how people will get around without cars, there are plenty of alternative modes of transportation available. Ultimately, the benefits of a car-free city far outweigh the challenges, and it's important that cities around the world explore the possibility of becoming car-free.		1
Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers its present because its 97 persent of cardon dioxide blanks. The temperature of Venus is even worst them Earth. Why would a scientist need people to Venus to make us die from the air and the clouds. Being at Venus won't do anyting better for living there. Some reasons why people shouldn't stay in Venus is the air, the clouds, and planet's surface.  The reasons why Venus is so dangers is because of the air. the clouds, and the planet's surface. Venis thick atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blanket. The clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The plant's surface temperature is average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Our sister plane is so inhospitable. I don't know why scientist are talking about further visites to the surface. They think that long away that Venus had everything like Earth but it might not true. Why is NASA going to send people to Venus to study it? It's a bad idea to do it because all they going to do it die.  Is Venus really a twin to Earth no its not. This is why Venus has so much danger because of the air, the clouds, and the planet's surface. NASA should just send robots to Venus instead of people. Making a person to go to risk their life is not fair. Robots are the better answer. 		0
Dear Principal:  I truly understand you on this policy, there is many reasons why this policy should be considered. Many students love sport willing to do anything to get in the sport team. By this, I'm saying that if they have low grades they will have to try harder to get in the sport. This will not only improve there grade but will help them get higher test scores.  Many students at my school love sports and are always talking about it. Now this means that they will do whatever is possible to get in the sport which as a result they have to have higher grades. If all students are in a sport and have good grades they will be able to have a good collage application.  On the other hand many people may think that a sport is a good way to keep a student healthy and active. But if this police it given not only will they be healthy but be motivative to keep their grades higher. This will help then throw out the school year.  I am very appreciated of you for taking time out of your day to read my letter. If you have any questions or comments feel free to send a letter or a call. this will defiantly be a good police in consideration. Again thank you so much!		0
In my opinion I think that the author did a great job on sjowing the dangers of venus beause he gave a lot of information. He also tells us about the name that they give venus and the way that they describe the planet. Now that I have read the passage I now know that venbus is a very dangerous planet to explore.  In the passage the author states that Venus was the closest planet to earth. Venus was to the closest to the size and distance of the earth. It was often called earths twin. Venus was also called the Evening Star,but that nickname was very misleading since it was actually a planet. Venus is also one of the most easiest planet to spot if you are standing on earth. Although venus was the closest to the planet The author also started to notice that Mars was close to earth also. Then he started noticing that sometimes Venus was closer to Mars and sometimes Mars was closer to Earth then Venus.  Venus hasnt been explored since it is way to dangerous to be explored. They would send ships that are unmanned,because when ever they would send people that were inside the paceship they would not survive the landing. That is the main reason why they havent landed there or try to land there in three decades. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide covers Venus. The passage states that "Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfic acid in venus Atmosphere. On the planets surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,And the Atmoshperic pressure is 90 times more greater then what we experience on our own planet".  Astronomers are saying that Venus may have once been been a planet like earth. I think that he did a really good job on collenting information abou venus .i hope that one day Astronomers will be able to land on Venus safely and be able to explore it. The reason is because I wonder what it is like to be on that planet. In my opinion I think that one day it will be possible to explore Venus.		0
 Impression can be changed based on personal experiences and attitudes, but it is not always easy to change. Everyone has a different impression, but it can be influenced by various factors. For example, a person's self-respect and kindness can positively impact their impression on others. Celebrities who do good things to impress people may gain a positive impression, but if they behave badly, their impression can quickly change.  It is important to note that having an impression on others is not just about being famous. Even if a person is not famous, they can still have an impression on others through their kindness and helpfulness. However, it is important to use this impression in the right ways. If a person is constantly fighting with others or does not know how to talk nicely, their impression can quickly change.  It is also important to remember that a person's impression can be changed based on their actions. If a person uses their impression to make others feel bad, their impression can quickly change. This is why many people wish to have an impression on others, as it can give them power and influence over others.  However, it is important to be careful when using an impression. If a person is not nice, kind, and careful, their impression can quickly change. This is why many people need an impression on others, as it can give them power and influence over others.  In conclusion, impression can be changed based on personal experiences and attitudes. It is important to use an impression in the right ways, as it can give a person power and influence over others. However, it is also important to be careful when using an impression, as it can quickly change if not used correctly.		1
I along with other students, hate summer projects especially when a teacher designs it. As you can already tell i'm against teacher designed projects, and here¬†is¬†why.  When a teacher designs a summer project or any project in that matter it can be very uninteresting, which increases the chance that a student would just forget about the project or put in a low effort. Teachers these days give out more online work than paper, and anything online can be easily forgotten. Due to the fact that its online means that students would have to stay inside and not do what they've planned for the summer. Some students work efficiently if its on paper rather than a computer. What i'm trying to say here is that summer projects should not be designed by teachers.  A big reason why students should be the designers is because that teachers lack something the fresh minds of young students have. That something is creativity, believe it or not creativity can get you far in life and it even makes school work a lot easier and fun. Doing anything in the same old fashioned traditional way can be tiresome and repetitive ,but doing work or anything can be a lot more¬†enjoyable and easy if you think of a creative way to do it. There is no reason at all a student should not be able to complete a project they designed themselves.  Now I know some people think teacher designed summer projects are more direct and easy to follow this is false because if you make the project you know all the steps and how to follow them.  In conclusion students should be the ones designing summer projects not teachers.		0
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:  Working Alone vs. Working in a Group: Which is Better?  As an 8th grader, I've had my fair share of both individual and group projects. While working with others can be fun and exciting, I believe that working alone has more benefits than working in a group.  First of all, when you work alone, you can focus better on the task at hand. There are fewer distractions and interruptions when you're working by yourself, which means you can get more done in less time. For example, when I'm working on a science project, I can concentrate on the experiment without having to worry about what my group members are doing. This helps me to think more clearly and come up with better ideas.  Another benefit of working alone is that you can learn more about the topic. When you're working in a group, you might not have as much time to research and learn about the topic as you would if you were working alone. But when you're working alone, you can take your time to read and learn as much as you want, which can help you to understand the topic better. For instance, when I was working on a history project, I was able to spend more time reading about the topic and learning new things, which helped me to get a better grade.  Working alone can also lead to more creativity. When you're working with others, you might feel like you have to conform to their ideas and opinions. But when you're working alone, you can let your imagination run wild and come up with unique and innovative ideas. For example, when I was working on a writing project, I was able to come up with a story that was completely different from what my group members had come up with, and it turned out to be one of the best parts of the project.  Finally, working alone can help you to develop your time management skills. When you're working with others, it can be easy to get distracted and fall behind schedule. But when you're working alone, you have to be more responsible and manage your time better. For instance, when I was working on a math project, I had to make sure I finished my part on time, which helped me		1
Privacy protections on social media is a super important thing that we need to think about. Like, I know that I share a lot of stuff online, but that doesn't mean that I want just anyone to see it. I mean, have you seen all the creeps and weirdos on Instagram? They're always trying to slide into your DMs and stuff. It's super gross.  So, yeah, I think we definitely need stronger privacy protections. Like, maybe we should be able to control who sees our stuff, like, actually control it, not just have those stupid privacy settings that never work. And maybe we should be able to delete stuff forever, instead of just having it hidden. That way, we can make sure that our personal information doesn't get out there and get used for bad things.  I know some people might say that privacy protections are a bad thing because they'll stop us from sharing information and connecting with each other. But, like, that's not true. We can still share stuff and connect with each other, but we should be able to do it safely and without worrying about our personal information getting out there.  And, honestly, I think it's kind of weird that we don't have stronger privacy protections already. Like, don't we deserve to have control over our own information? It's not like we're asking for too much. We just want to be able to share stuff online without worrying about it getting out of control.  So, yeah, I think we definitely need stronger privacy protections on social media. It's time for us to take control of our own information and make sure that it's safe.		1
Have you ever felt like you don't know anyone or don' t really have a hobby? Extracurricular activities can change that. Many people have found their passion and have continued on and have become very successful because of a club or activity they were in as a student. I believe if we require extracurricular activities, students have the opportunity to make new friends, discover new interests and cure their after school boredom.  Firstly, getting students involved in an extracurricular¬†activity will help them to make new friends and meet new people. This can help students make friends with a similar interests. For example, one of the most beloved country music duos of all time, Brooks and Dunn, met through extracurricular activities. In 6th grade, the two joined a club called FFA and fell in love with it. Their FFA chapter had a bus for the members when they went on trips. The old, rusty bus had no radio. A couple close friends of the boys had saw them sing in church before and suggested they sing on the trips because of the broken radio in the bus. The boys agreed and sang all sorts of country songs for the members as they traveled. The boys had such a passion for singing what was on the radio that they figured they would produce songs for the radio. Now, they are both millionaires and travel to sing all across the world.  In addition to making new friends, extracurricular activities sprout interest in other hobbies. In 1988, a mother signed her child up for music club because she was working late and didn' t want her daughter at home by herself. Little did she know, her daughter would be one of the most famous singers in history. Her daughter was the worldwide phenomenon, Taylor Swift. Taylor was a shy kid. Though she had a passion for music, she was to scared to sing in front of people. While being in music club, Taylor gained enough confidence to sing in church. While singing in church, a record label producer was there and signed her to his label. She is now producing music and make millions of dollars.  Lastly, extracurricular activities give students something to do when they get home, after school. Some students come home and immediately turn on the TV or play video games, instead of exercising or doing their homework. If it wasn't for a policy at J.K Rowling' s school would would not have the many great books we have today. Her freshman year of high school she entered book club. She gained a love and passion for science fiction books and decided to start writing them. Many of her books have been turned into movies and she is now one of the most successful authors of all time.  In conclusion, extracurricular activities are very beneficial to our students in many ways. They can help our students be successful in our future careers.  I believe if we require extracurricular activities, students have the wonderful opportunities like making new friends, discovering new interests and giving kids something to do after school. These can help students in many ways and help us develop a successful future generation.¬†		0
 Do we ever feel surprised when people's behavior changes over time? This is because our first impressions of them can be difficult to change. While it is true that people can change, it is also true that their behavior is often influenced by their first impressions. This is why it is important to be cautious when judging people based on their initial behavior.  First impressions are not always accurate, and people can change their behavior for a variety of reasons. For example, a person may act a certain way in order to impress someone or to achieve a specific goal. This is not necessarily a reflection of their true character. Additionally, people may change their behavior due to external factors such as stress, depression, or poverty. These factors can affect a person's behavior and make it difficult for them to act in a way that is consistent with their true character.  It is also important to remember that people can change their behavior for the better or for the worse. For example, a person who was once very shy may become more outgoing and confident with time. On the other hand, a person who was once very confident may become more reserved and cautious. It is up to each individual to decide how they want to change their behavior and to work towards making those changes.  It is important to approach people with an open mind and to be willing to see them in a new light. This means being patient and understanding when someone's behavior changes, and not jumping to conclusions about their character based on their initial impressions. Instead, we should strive to get to know people on a deeper level and to form our opinions about them based on our experiences with them over time.  In conclusion, people's behavior can change over time, and it is important to be aware of this when forming our opinions about them. While first impressions can be difficult to change, people can change their behavior for a variety of reasons, and it is up to each individual to decide how they want to change their behavior. By approaching people with an open mind and being willing to see them in a new light, we can form more accurate and positive opinions about them.		1
As an eighth-grade student, I believe that participating in extracurricular activities is essential for our growth and development. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why students should participate in extracurricular activities.  Firstly, extracurricular activities provide an opportunity for students to explore their interests and passions. Whether it's sports, music, drama, or any other activity, students can learn new skills and develop their talents. This exposure to different activities can help students discover what they enjoy and what they don't, leading to a more informed decision when choosing their future career path.  Secondly, participating in extracurricular activities can help students develop important life skills. For example, being part of a team can teach students the value of teamwork, communication, and leadership. Additionally, extracurricular activities can help students develop time management skills, as they learn to balance their academic responsibilities with their extracurricular commitments.  Thirdly, extracurricular activities can help students build their resumes and stand out to colleges and employers. Many extracurricular activities require dedication, commitment, and hard work, which are all valuable skills that colleges and employers look for. Furthermore, extracurricular activities can demonstrate a student's passion and enthusiasm for a particular field, which can be a deciding factor in the college admissions process.  In conclusion, I believe that participating in extracurricular activities is essential for students' growth and development. These activities provide an opportunity to explore interests, develop important life skills, and build a strong resume. As students, we should embrace the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities and make the most of our time in school.		1
Driving a car can be a good idea in the country where you might not be able to walk to every place that is a necessity. But why drive a car and sit there for up to thirty minutes in traffic when you can walk there in under ten or ride a bike in just under five, now if that sounds like great logic to you then great; if you are like the majority of people in this current day and age then you would not need to feel the erdge to drive, you would rather ride a bike and feel the breeze of the fresh crisp air in your hair.  The new trend of living is here, more and more communities are popping up that are car free. As the first source has stated "...70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here." more and more people are deciding to not own a car or even to just sell their cars so that way it is not a burden on their shoulders to maintain the cars. Most of the people who decide to give up their cars say it's a much happier way to live.  Some countries are even putting a ban on driving on certain days like paris did in source two. It stated that "...motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine." This ban went on for roughly five days for the smog cleared enough for all to resume preferd ways of transportation.  In colombia the government made a car-free day so that way more people would get comforatable with finding alternate ways or commuting said in the third source "car-free day is spinning into a big hit Bogota" by Andrew Selsky. All in all more and more nation and people are deciding to go car free for good. Maybe you wil catch on and join in on this car free lifestyle.        ¬†    		0
I dont believe that the authors Justifications for visiting venus are great enough for us to risk losing human lives. As stated in the passage temperatures average around 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that of earth's. This would mean absolute death for for any type of exploration around of venuses surface if something wrong were to happen.  One way to manage survival on the planet was to use a blimp type vehicle to stay away from most of the venuses dangers. Even if it did manage to work very little insight of how the terrain of venus is like would be aquired do to light not being able to penetrate the dense atmosphere. So it is possible to survive but who knows that this theory would go seamlessly. What if a series of unfortunate events were to happen and innocent men were slaughtered because of venuses harsh envirenmont.  Why should innocent men be killed just because of scientist wanting to satisfy they're curiosity.  The final part of the passage states that our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edge of imagination and innovation. This means that they would do irrational things just to accomplish they're desires. I believe that this is dangerous and could have terrible results for our future. Why are we studying other planets when we have our own issues to deal with. It seems as though the government funds NASA to set out and accomplish things like this that doesn't benfit our lives or the future of this country. Lets say Everything goes perfectly and they study venuses until they're hearts content. Now the government has wasted an enormous amount of money on something idiotic that does not benefit society at all but hey at least now we can say we have been to Venus and thats it. Their is so much more ways they could put that money into good use but instead they want to find more about something floating in space. In conclusion my evaluation of the Author is that he stated how we could achieve having life on venus but poor reasons as to why it would benefit us. 		0
Dear Principle,  I think that kids should be allowed to have their phones out during lunch or any other free time. If kids do take advantage of having phones out during class and texting other classmates or texting inappropriate then they shouldn't be able to have there phones out during lunch or other free times. That doesn't mean you should punish everyone.  One reason kids should be able to have there phones out during lunch time is because some kids have to text or call parents about tutorials after school or after school practice because if you have after school practice for track and your suppose to go and practice at the high school and the weather is getting bad you would have to call/text your parents to tell them your not going to practice or your going to stay at the school until whatever time the coaches say, also if you have to stay for tutorials after school and the teacher tells you during class then how is your parents going to know to pick you up or not.  Another reason is because some kids have medical conditions that call for medicines, insulin, or anything else that will help, but not all kids wanna go to the office and call every time he/she needs them, so that's why we should be allowed to have phones out during lunch or other free times.		0
Dear principle.  I strongly think that you should go with policy number two. I have three reasons why we should not have cell phones in school.  first off, cell phones are just a distraction. Kids will bring there phone to class and text when the teacher is not looking. When a student is texting it distracts other student to because there worried about what the other student is doing. And if these two arnt the case then the student isn't paying attention because all there thinking about is lunch when they can use there phone.  My second reason is cheating. Now a days kids have all shorts of things on cell phones that can help them cheat on tests. They have calculators or they could have put the answers in there phone. If kids know that one of there friends had a class before them they could text them for there answers. There are many was that kids can use a cell phone to cheat on a test or homework.  My final reason that kids shouldn't have cell phones in school is that kids wont do there work. If kids are doing work and there's a phone in front of them there going to drop what there doing and chose the phone over home work. Even if there just taking a break from there work and use the phone there going to get so wrapped up in it there going to forget there work. No kid is going to pick home work over a phone in this modern day.  I gave you three reasons why kid shouldn't have phones in school and there are plenty more. I hope you consider my reasons and bane phones from school.		0
The author of the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" argues that studying Venus is worth the risk despite the dangers it presents. The author provides some evidence to support this idea. However, I believe that the author does not support their argument well enough.  Firstly, the author claims that exploring Venus could lead to important discoveries about the planet's climate and geology. This is a valid point because Venus is similar to Earth in many ways, and understanding its atmosphere and geology could help us understand our own planet better. However, the author does not provide enough detail to support this claim.  Secondly, the author suggests that the technology used to explore Venus could be used to explore other planets in the future. This is a reasonable argument because if we can successfully explore Venus, we could use the same technology to explore other planets in our solar system. However, the author does not provide enough evidence to support this claim.  Lastly, the author argues that exploring Venus could inspire future generations to pursue careers in science and engineering. This is a good point because exploring Venus could be a great achievement, and it could motivate young people to study science and engineering. However, the author does not provide enough evidence to support this claim.  In conclusion, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. While the author provides some evidence to support this idea, I believe that the evidence is not strong enough. The author needs to provide more detail and evidence to convince the reader that exploring Venus is worth the risk.		1
The Challenge of Exploring Venus, the author suggest that studying Venus is a despite of dangers and presents because. In the text it states that Venus is the closet planet to Earth terms of density and the size and occasionally the distance too. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97% of carbon dioxide, and even more challenging Venus clouds are highly made of corrosive sulfuric acid. On the planet surface Venus have average temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.  The author also states that Venus has a atmospheric pressure of 90 times greater than planet earth. The conditions of planet Venus are far more extreme than any ohter humans ecounter on earth, it could even destroy a submarine because the pressure is very extreme. Nasa states that they will have to build a vehicle that could handle the extreme pressure of venus and the conditions also. Finally, Nasa would have to use the old technology that they used in WW2 and the moon landing.		0
Topic: The Effects of Social Media on Mental Health  Introduction  Social media has become an integral part of our lives. From Facebook to Instagram to Twitter, we spend hours scrolling through our feeds, liking posts, and connecting with friends and family. But what impact is this having on our mental health? In this project, I will explore the effects of social media on mental health and design a project that is individualized to me.  Research  To begin my project, I conducted research on the topic. I read articles from reputable sources such as the World Health Organization and the American Psychological Association. I also looked at studies that have been conducted on the topic. One study that caught my attention was a study conducted by the Royal Society for Public Health in the United Kingdom. The study found that social media can have both positive and negative effects on mental health.  Positive Effects  The study found that social media can have positive effects on mental health. For example, social media can be a way to connect with others who may be going through similar experiences. It can also be a way to stay informed about mental health issues and to find resources for seeking help.  Negative Effects  However, the study also found that social media can have negative effects on mental health. For example, social media can lead to feelings of anxiety and depression. It can also lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Additionally, social media can be a source of cyberbullying, which can have a severe impact on mental health.  Project Idea  Based on my research, I have decided to design a project that is individualized to me. My project will be a social media detox. For one week, I will delete all of my social media accounts and see how it affects my mental health. I will document my experiences in a journal, noting any changes in my mood, anxiety levels, and self-esteem.  Sources of Information  To complete my project, I will use a variety of sources of information. I will use the articles and studies that I read during my research phase. I will also use my own experiences and observations. Additionally, I will use my journal to document my experiences during the detox.  Conclusion  In conclusion, social media can have both positive and negative effects on mental health. While it can		1
Cell Phone Use While Driving  Cell phone use became widely available in the 1980's. The drastic improvements in functionality and design caused the use of cell phones to increase tremendously over the last two decades, for billions of people worldwide. The primary reasons why cell phone usage increased so dramatically over the past two decades are essentially because they make communicating much easier, they enable you to contact people within seconds or minutes, regardless of whether they are thousands of miles away, in another country or just a few feet away, you can locate and access places quickly and more conveniently, and they can provide security. As a result of the improved functionality and design allows cell phones to operate like computers. Its vast improvements have created a pandemonium because unlike before, people are able to easily connect with loved ones, friends, and even meet new people through social media. Downloading apps to cell phones offers endless opportunities for communicating whether by email, face-time, text messaging, also conversations, scheduling planning/diet planner, internet surfing, and alarms, etc, are just a few features that are available. While these mini devices have become a key part of our daily lives offering huge advantages, equally they can have their disadvantages especially, when being used while driving a vehicle. The compulsive use of them is a distraction, resulting in many road accidents that have ended with very serious casualties.  The prevalent use of cell phones has made the task become like second nature. While this may be true, being capable of using a cell phone so adeptly while driving a vehicle has not prevented drivers from losing their focus. Habitual use of the cell phone has diminished the responsibilities of a driver's who are supposed to constantly keep their eyes on the road, and their hands continuously on the steering wheel. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) approximately 660,000 drivers were using their phones while driving behind the wheel during the daytime all told, a full 14% of fatal distracted driving crashes involved a cell phone that was in use at the time of the wreck ("Deadly Distracted Driving Stats." DMV.ORG, 28 Apr. 2017). The National Safety Council reports that an estimated 1.6 million crashes a year are because of utilization of cell phones while driving. Although, most drivers support the ban of hand-held cell phone use and texting, majority admit to still doing it anyway. According to a AAA poll, 94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway ("Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving." Edgar Snyder & Associates, n. d. Web. 12 Dec).  Georgia's new cell phone law, Hands-Free Driving, enacted Sunday, July 1st , 2018, was an imperative deterrent to reduce the number of fatal accidents, and loss of life for many innocent victims. Currently, forty-seven states have banned texting and driving, additionally, the 15 other states that have enacted the hands-free law, which requires drivers to use hands free technology, have seen fewer deaths and a 16 percent decrease in traffic fatalities in the two years after the law was enacted ("House Bill 673- Hands-Free Law"). Despite of the disadvantages or dangers of texting and driving, it does have a few advantages such as; navigation, provides help by making emergency contacts if in a dangerous situation and provides information about weather, traffic, or roadside accidents.  In conclusion, thousands of people are killed every day because of the distractions of these mini devices. This epidemic has become as serious as drinking under the influence. If drivers considered the risks and their responsibilities while being behind the wheel, they would adhere to the law by purchasing devices enabling them to be hands free when using a cell phone. Whatever text or phone call that pops up on the screen of their phones can wait. It's for the safety of you and most importantly others.

Have you ever needed some dire advice for something urgent and asked only one person and wondered why things went wrong. Asking one person is not safe. Some people could mislead you on accident or on purpose. In other cases some people are just not experienced in the situation. Well in these situations you should always ask multiple people.  More opinions give you more options to choose from. Having more options can help you come to the solutions to your problem much easier. You can pick the option that you are most comfortable with and sounds the best. Which also makes you more confident when going through with the advice and putting it to use.  Another bonus is that it makes sure you are not getting bad advice. Some people are just not experienced on some topics and Should not being giving you advise¬†at all. So if you ask one person they are going to pretend like they are experienced because everyone wants to help a friend. Asking multiple people means you have the chance to be asking someone that knows a lot about what you need help with.  The last pro of asking multiple people is that they could all come to the same conclusion. If everyone comes to same conclusion or a majority of people that should be the advice you go with. If majority goes with this advice it is going to give you the best outcome. Also it is easier to decide when everyone is saying the same thing.  That is why when seeking advice you should always ask multiple people. More opinions are more options and it is the safer route in general. Some people could just give you terrible information or opinions and with a group they would fix that. Also when multiple people are saying one thing it should be majority rules. So always ask multiple people it could save you.		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the president of the United States by popular vote.  The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that gives disproportionate power to a handful of small states. In recent years, the Electoral College has failed to reflect the will of the people in two of the last five presidential elections. In 2000, George W. Bush won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to Al Gore. And in 2016, Donald Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly three million votes.  The Electoral College is also a major source of voter apathy. Many people feel that their vote does not matter because they live in a state that is already considered to be a "safe" state for one party or the other. This is particularly true in states with a large number of electoral votes, such as California and Texas.  Abolishing the Electoral College would make every vote count in presidential elections. It would also ensure that the president is elected by the majority of the American people, rather than by a small group of swing voters in a handful of states.  I urge you to support legislation that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the president of the United States by popular vote.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my concern about the Electoral College and to urge you to support a national popular vote for president. I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in the 21st century.  The Electoral College was created in the 18th century, when the United States was a very different country. At that time, communication and travel were much slower, and it was difficult for people in different parts of the country to know much about each other's candidates. The Electoral College was created as a way to ensure that all parts of the country would have a say in the election of the president.  However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary. Today, we have the internet and other means of communication that allow people to learn about candidates from all over the country. We also have a much more efficient transportation system, so it is easy for candidates to campaign all over the country.  In addition, the Electoral College is unfair. It is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. In that election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the election because he won more electoral votes.  This is unfair because it means that the candidate who does not win the most votes can still become president. This is not democracy.  I urge you to support a national popular vote for president. This would be the fairest and most democratic way to elect the president.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your name]		1
Dear state senator,  Do you think that we should keep the Electoral College? We should keep the electoral college because the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.  You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state ad shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascentainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. Abolishing the electoral college! According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore,Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole,the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  The single best arguement against the Electoral College is what we might call the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In the same vein, "faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.  At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states. It's official: The Electoral College is unfair,outdated, and irrational. The best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguements against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college! The Electoral College is a widely regarded as an anachronism,a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular vots the winner. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College. The first reason is certainty of outcome. The second reason is everyone's president. The third reason is swing states. The fourth reason is big states. And the last reason is to avoid run-off elections.  It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. But of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election [source 3: In defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our dispised method of choosing president]. That is why we should keep the Electoral College.    		0
 Do you believe that consuming too much oil in your food affects your health or improves your ability to perform better in school? I argue that while some people believe that oil-rich foods are beneficial for academic performance, the health risks associated with excessive oil intake outweigh any potential benefits.  On one hand, proponents of oil-rich foods argue that they enhance cognitive function and increase productivity. Studies have shown that certain types of fats, such as omega-3 fatty acids, can improve brain function and cognitive performance. However, it is important to note that these benefits are associated with moderate consumption of healthy fats, not excessive intake of unhealthy oils.  On the other hand, excessive oil intake can lead to a range of negative health outcomes, including heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer. High-fat diets have been linked to increased cholesterol levels, which can lead to plaque buildup in the arteries and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Additionally, high-fat diets have been associated with an increased risk of certain types of cancer, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer.  Furthermore, excessive oil intake can lead to weight gain, which can negatively impact academic performance. Studies have shown that overweight and obesity are associated with lower academic achievement, including lower test scores and decreased attendance rates.  In conclusion, while some people believe that oil-rich foods are beneficial for academic performance, the health risks associated with excessive oil intake outweigh any potential benefits. It is important for individuals to consume a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods, while limiting their intake of unhealthy oils. Schools should also play a role in promoting healthy eating habits by offering a variety of healthy food options in the cafeteria.		1
Hey there!  For this essay, I wanted to explore how having a positive attitude can lead to success in life. I mean, let's be real, having a positive outlook can make such a big difference in how we approach challenges and how others perceive us.  First of all, when you have a positive attitude, you're more likely to take risks and try new things. Like, think about it, if you're always thinking "this might not work out" or "I'm not good enough," you're gonna miss out on some amazing opportunities. But if you're like, "YOLO, let's give it a shot!" you're way more likely to succeed. Plus, it's way more fun to try new things when you're excited about it!  And it's not just about taking risks, having a positive attitude can also help you make better connections with people. When you're positive and enthusiastic, people are way more likely to want to be around you and work with you. Like, think about it, would you rather work with someone who's always complaining or someone who's always excited about the project?  Exactly.  But, I know some people might say that having a positive attitude doesn't really affect success in life. They might say that hard work and talent are way more important than being positive. And while that's true, I think it's way more important to have a good attitude while you're working hard and being talented. I mean, if you're putting in all this effort and you're still not getting the results you want, it can be really discouraging. But if you're positive and excited about what you're doing, it's way easier to keep going and keep trying.  And let's not forget about the benefits of being positive and successful at the same time. When you're achieving your goals and you're feeling good about it, it's like this huge boost to your self-esteem. You're like, "Yessss, I did it!" And it's way more fun to celebrate your successes when you're feeling good about yourself.  But, I guess some people might		1
I am going to prove that the face you saw on the planet is not a alien and that it is a natrual landform. On May 24,2001,"NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet,snappin photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2,when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormos head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the camreas from region of the Red Planet called Cydonia."This shows how it all started."A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head..formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth."The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attenion to mars."This shows that everyone is going to go back and forth about if its a alien or a landform."And so on April 5,1998,when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time,Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC)team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orignal Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site,reavaling...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This shows that ther was no alien face in the planet in the first place and that it was a landform the whole time.                                                                                 		0
 Introduction:  The Face on Mars is a geological feature that has been causing a lot of excitement for many years. Some believe that it is a sign of extraterrestrial life, while others think it is just a natural landform. In this essay, I will present evidence that supports the claim that the Face on Mars is a natural landform, and argue that it does not have any extraterrestrial origin.   Body:  According to the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars,' the Face is not a recent formation, but has been present on the planet for billions of years. It is a large, dark area on the planet's surface, which is composed of iron oxide and magnetite. This iron oxide and magnetite are thought to have been formed by volcanic activity and the deposition of dust from the planet's atmosphere. The article also reveals that the Face is not a solid structure, but rather a complex network of valleys, rilles, and other geological features. This suggests that it is a natural landform, rather than something created by intelligent beings.   Evidence from the article also supports the claim that the Face is a natural landform. For example, scientists have discovered that the iron oxide and magnetite that make up the Face are not evenly distributed, but are clustered in certain areas. This suggests that the Face has formed through a process of natural erosion and weathering, rather than being imposed on the planet's surface by an external force. Additionally, the Face is constantly changing, with new features appearing and disappearing over time. This is consistent with natural geological processes, rather than the actions of an intelligent species.   Conclusion:  In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a natural landform, and not the result of extraterrestrial activity. The evidence presented in the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars,' along with the scientific principles that govern the formation of geological features, all point towards a natural origin for the Face. It is important for us to continue exploring the planet and learning more about its geology, so that we can better understand its origins and what they might tell us about the history of the universe.		1
Being knowledgeable of other people's opinions and giving advice can be extremely beneficial in many different ways. Firstly, it can help prevent people from getting hurt or wasting money. For example, if a friend is considering investing in a new stock, you may be able to provide them with valuable insights and advice that could help them make a more informed decision. This could potentially save them from losing a significant amount of money if the stock turns out to be a poor investment.  Additionally, being knowledgeable of other people's opinions can also help to build stronger relationships. When you take the time to listen to someone else's perspective and offer your own advice, it shows that you value their opinion and care about their well-being. This can help to foster a sense of trust and respect between the two of you, which can be incredibly valuable in both personal and professional relationships.  Of course, it's important to approach giving advice with caution. It's not always appropriate to give unsolicited advice, and it's important to be mindful of the potential consequences of your words. However, when done correctly, giving advice can be a powerful tool for helping others and building stronger relationships.  One example of how giving advice can help prevent people from getting hurt is in the realm of relationships. If a friend is struggling with a difficult decision about their romantic life, you may be able to offer them valuable advice and guidance that could help them make a more informed decision. For example, you may be able to help them consider the potential long-term consequences of their actions, or offer suggestions for how they might handle a difficult situation. By doing so, you could potentially help them avoid making a decision that could lead to heartbreak or other negative consequences.  Another example of how giving advice can help prevent people from wasting money is in the realm of personal finance. If a friend is considering investing in a new stock or starting a new business, you may be able to offer them valuable advice and guidance that could help them make more informed financial decisions. For example, you may be able to help them research the potential risks and rewards of their investment, or offer suggestions for how they might save money or cut costs in their business. By doing so, you could potentially help them avoid making a decision that could lead to financial ruin.  In conclusion, being knowledgeable of other people's opinions and giving advice can be incredibly		1
 Seeking multiple opinions when making an important decision or choice is beneficial for a few key reasons. First, different people have different perspectives and areas of expertise. By getting input from more than one person, you are exposed to a wider range of perspectives and types of advice. This prevents you from only considering one narrow viewpoint.   For example, let's say you were choosing between two job offers and wanted advice. Speaking to just one friend may only provide insight into one aspect such as salary or commute times. However, talking to multiple people like a parent, mentor and coworker could round out your input. A parent may focus on job security or health benefits while a coworker could offer advice based on their direct experience with one of the companies. Gathering various perspectives gives you a more well-rounded analysis to make your decision.  In addition, getting multiple opinions acts as a check against bias. Any one individual you ask may unintentionally let their own biases or personal preferences influence the advice they give. However, if several people all agree on a certain position, it suggests that position has merit rather than just catering to one bias. You can identify consensus opinions that cut through individual biases.   Finally, conflicting opinions force you to examine the choice more critically. When different advisors disagree on what you should do, it requires you to think more deeply about the pros and cons of each option based on their rationales. You can't just adopt one opinion outright but must weigh the different perspectives. This leads to a choice feeling more thoroughly considered from multiple angles rather than potentially overlooking important factors.   In conclusion, seeking advice from multiple trusted sources is highly valuable when making significant decisions. It exposes you to a diversity of viewpoints, checks against individual biases, and encourages more rigorous thought about the options available. Weighing varied counsel ultimately results in choices that feel well supported and carefully made rather than potentially premature or narrow in scope.		1
The automobile was made a long time ago to help us move around faster and more efficient,however,have we really thought about the benefits that could come from limiting the usage of cars such as:Saving money in gas and insurance,Less car crash related injuries and even because its better for the environment.  With limiting the usage of cars comes many pro's such as saving money. On average,an American spends about thirtyfive to forty dollars on gas per fillup and one hundred to two hundred dollars a month on insurance a month depending on age,experience,accidents,etc. By limiting your car usage completely or even just a little just imagine the extra money you'll have laying around for the nessecities and maybe even a ittle youtime. Say you buy a bike and the only time you use your car is to drive to work and anywhere outofstate,that means that you'll be able to go a week with roughly two gallons of gas. That puts you at about thirtyeight hundred dollars a year where if you were purchasing four or five gallons a week you'd be spending approximately eleven thousand dollars a year. Thats no chump change. You're insurance would gradually decrease due to safe driving and age so along with gas being cheaper,so would the insurance.  Florida is a state wellknown for car crashes due to weather conditions like rain and fog and you can't do anything to change that other than take a different,much safer mode of transportation such as a bus. Nowadays bus and semitruck drivers are more experienced and cautious then they used to for one reason,CYBCover your Butt.You see major bus and semitruck companies now that due to the size of their vehicles,if there's ever crash involving one of their automobiles then they're likely to get blamed cause of the size of the vehicles and so it would make since for them to send their drivers to extensive training and make sure that their trucks are in good hands,which is exactly what they do. Studies show that you're chances of being in a wreck in a bus are one of every one hundred rides while being in a car driven by yourself puts you at a whopping one of ten ridesyur chances of safety are greatly increased.  The United States of America has no shortage of pollution and that's not helped by the fact that we have one of the largest populations of personal automobiles inhabiting this country. There are many other kinds of pollution that occurrs in the land of the free but most of it like factory smoke,large shipboatsmoke and even resturant made smoke can not really be stopped or diminished by you or me but one form of pollution we can prevent is automobile smoke. In the US up to fifty percent of greenhouse gas is from carscertain areas.If you stop using you car and ride a bike even thugh it won't seem like muchyou'd be suprised at the difference. Say a sall cmmunity around yur neighborhood gives up their cars that could account for half a percent of greenhouse gas which is more than it seems. Just ask yourself if you want your friends and family growing up in a dying,polluted world.  In conclusion,I'm not discrediting the huge help cars can be in our daily lives I'm just slaying if we continue along this carorientated path,pollution may be what ends our daily lives.		0
Our country's history with cars date back a few centuries. Today, there are many cars from different brands, with different designs, and with different benefits. Though all these cars have one thing in common they emit harmful pollution to the air. We already know that the pollutantss given off from cars have caused the greenhouse effect in the world. This has been a main topic for decades, on how to figure out how to solve and reduce the amount of pollution so that Earth can sustain us. Limiting car usage will reduce the pollutants emission from the cars, it will cause less traffic jam and congestion in parking, and some people are tend to become more relaxed and happy.  The Earth is being effected with harmful gases caused by cars. Our vehicles that we drive everyday, the one we take to work or schools or places you want to see, are the main source of pollutantss coming into the air and causing the greenhouse gases. The limited usage of cars will reduce the amount of emission given off. In the article "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer, France has the most amount of smog in the European countries. This smog has caused warmer layers of air to trap car emissions will cause heat to the country. But when they have put a ban in cars for a while, the amount of smog has decreased. Furthermore, if we continue to reduce or at less limit the amount of time we spend driving or riding in the car, we can help reduce the emissions made. Rosenthal states, "...emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities." If we do not limit the use of cars now, not only will the Earth suffer, people will suffer as well. The limit usage of cars can save the Earth and ourselves.  The constant honking, switching lands, and when reached the destination, a parking is needed to be found. With the amount of cars, traffic jam and lack of parking space is evitable. Pollution also contributes to the traffic jam and congestion. Though if limited cars we used congestion will come down. According to Duffer, "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..." The lack of cars on the road will cause many more people to get to work or school or any place they want without rushing becaus the roads are clear. Moreover, parking space is a hassle to find when there are so many cars everywhere. With less cars means less space for parking, this could save money for the government and invest more on what the country needs. In Vauban, Germany, they had to give up their cars but on the positive side, on the main streets, stores are placed walking distance rather than on a highway Source 1. With the less amount of cars, highways and roads do not have to be invested in too much rather the money may be used to invest in other important things.  When we are younger, we dream of driving and having a bit of freeedom but when we actually start driving it gets tiring. Some people are stressed out when driving and tend to be very prone to accidents. Though when just taking a bicycle or walking it relieves stress. Carlos Arturo Plaza states in the article "Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota", "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." Stress will only increase when we get older, taking off a load of stress by limiting the usage of cars can be a breather for all of us. Also, people are happy when they do not need cars. Heirdrun Walter said, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, Rosenthal" When Heirdrum means "this way", she is referring to not using a car to get to places. A person should be happy rather than angry and rage because when in a car, some people may do things that could hurt them.  Roads and highways are always being invested because of the increase in car users. If we continue this in the future, there might not be a bright future if we do not stop it. The limit of using cars can cause less pollution in our air, get people to places faster, and make a person smile. This may lead some down fall into the economy and for the employees but with the increase of other alternative to get to places this can lead into a boom in the economy. The positives out run the negatives in this topic. If cars are limited, parks and sports centers will bloom uneven, pitted sidewalks will be fixed to smooth sidewalks rushhour will be cut traffic and food places and stores will increase. Even the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company proposed "parternering with the telecommunications inductry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transprtation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety'" Source 4. In the end, it is up to decide if we would rather continue using cars or not. So go and choose the side that will benefit not only the economy or government but the people and environment.		0
I believe the Face on Mars is actually a natural landform. Even though the face does resemble something created by aliens, I still think that it is natural. I will show you why I believe that this is just a landform, and not a face created by aliens.  I believe the Face is a natural landform because scientists believe that the face resembles landforms around the American West. One scientist said that it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Also, the scientist added that its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face.  Scientists can be wrong sometimes though. However, scientists work on their research really hard, so I believe that they know what are doing and seeing. For example, scientists say that you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so we can see what the face is, a natural butte or mesa.  In the article, it states that on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped a photo ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image revealed that the face was just a landform, and no alien monument at all. The monument does look like aliens made it, but this fact just shows that the Face is fake and is actually is indeed a mesa.  This tells you why I believe that the Face is fake and is actually a basic landform. Even though the Face does look like aliens made it, it is more likely that it is a natural land form. These facts prove that the Face is not alien made.		0
Schools will stop students from succeeding if students learn online. Many schools are now allowing students to attend classes by video conferencing and other online ways. Students in certain schools have not just taken, but also passed core classes along with electives through online programs. Teachers use video calling applications like Skype or FaceTime to teach and educate students. Students should not be able to attend online classes or use video conferencing as a way of education because there are too many distractions in a students home, students can cheat much more easily when they are in their home rather than a classroom, and the internet is not reliable.  One reason that students should not learn online is because there are too many distractions in a students home for them to focus entirely on the subject at hand. For an example, if a student has younger siblings running around their work space at home, the student will not get a proper education because they will be constantly distracted. Another reason that students should not learn online is¬†because students can cheat much more easily when they are in their home rather than a classroom. There are tons of online applications that help students cheat on tests and even simple worksheets given out by educators. If a teacher cannot physically see the student right in front¬†of them taking a test or working on a paper, then that teacher cannot be sure that the student does not have an electronic device present that is helping them get all the answers off of the internet. The final reason that students should not learn online is because the internet is unreliable. When a student is working online, their internet might not always be stable, WiFi might not always be available in the students home, the teacher and students devices might not always be compatible with one another, and finally, the student might not always have access to a device.  Many people believe that schools should offer long distance leaning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, however, students should not be able to attend online classes or use video conferencing as a way of education because there are too many distractions in a students home, students can cheat much more easily when they are in their home rather than a classroom, and the internet is not reliable. Students should stick to the traditional way of learning, it has worked for hundreds of years in the past. We should not change the way of our education system if their is nothing wrong with it to begin with.		0
Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,  Community service is a great help to our society and not enough people do it. Some people think that community service takes up to much time in the day so they might not be able to do more fun things such as play sports or associate with friends. Although this may be true, community service is an ecstatic deed that everyone can do to serve our community. All in all, our school should be required to have our students do community service, and here's why.  Community service includes things such as helping the elderly, tutoring children, and even picking up litter. These may sound like tedious deeds, but where would the world be without people doing these things? We would all be rolling around in our own filth and our education would suffer from lack of mentors. Although they may be a pain to do, our school needs to try our hardest to get it done for our community.  Studies show that only 24% of people who know what community service is have actually performed an act of it. That leaves 76% of people who have not. Eventually, those numbers will come back to haunt us unless we do something about it. What we need to do is make our students perform community service. It doesn't have to be a lot, but something as simple as picking up trash around the campus or even helping a younger child get an A on a test. Whatever the deed may be, it will be helpful.  Another reason our school should make it mandatory to perform community service is that not enough students exercise. This may sound very cliche, but community service can also be a part of a physical education class, that way they are helping their community and they are benefiting from exercise. If we are to do this, it should not be a semester long thing, but maybe a week long unit of all the students chipping in to help better their community. And maybe our school could also start a club or group for the children who want to continue to better their community. Not only that, but it would also count as an extracurricular activity, which would help students in college and beyond.  If our school were to form a club or group for this, then many students would probably be associated with that club and that would spark others to join thereby creating a chain reaction of community service. If we can do that, then these children might continue it into the next generations and continue the chain of community service and help make the world a better place.  All in all, our school should defiantly consider making community service a necessary thing for our students. If we do this then it will help to make our community a better place, which is what we want for it. We can add community service into our physical education classes or maybe any other class, but in some way, shape, or form, we need to have community service in our school. So if you can please consider my thoughts and also consider adding community service then it would be much obliged. Thank you.  Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME		0
Having a positive attitude is one of the most important aspects of achieving success. A positive attitude can have a significant impact on the way we feel, think, and behave, and can ultimately shape our own destiny. Believing in yourself is the first step to making positive changes in one's life and achieving success. It is important to keep a healthy outlook and take each opportunity as a learning experience in order to reach your goals.   Working as part of a team is another important factor in achieving success. Working with others provides important skills and teaches us to be flexible so that we can interact and collaborate with team members in a productive way. Additionally, it can provide opportunities to learn and gain perspective from those around you.   Finally, staying motivated and setting realistic goals are essential components of success. It is important to maintain a consistent level of enthusiasm and optimism, and to break down large goals into smaller, achievable tasks that will keep you on track to accomplishing your goals. These smaller goals can serve as stepping stones to achieving a higher level of success in a variety of areas.   In conclusion, having a positive attitude is the foundation for achieving success in any area of life. Believing in yourself, interacting with others, and staying motivated are all key elements in developing long-term success. With the right attitude, you will be more likely to reach your goals and achieve greater success.		1
 My grandmother used to say "Your goals will never be achieved if you don't even take action."  I completely agree with the sentiment expressed by Thomas Jefferson that we can accomplish a lot more in life if we are always working towards our goals. We can make all the plans we want, but it doesn't matter if we don't put in the effort to make them a reality.  First of all, we need to have a clear sense of purpose and determination to achieve our goals in life. For example, when I was a child, my dream was to become a professional athlete. I knew that it would take a lot of hard work and dedication to achieve this goal, but I was willing to put in the effort to make it happen. I practiced every day, worked on my technique, and sought out coaching and mentorship to help me improve.  Furthermore, we can see the importance of taking action in every aspect of life. We can look at examples of people who started out as common citizens but have become influential figures in society because of their hard work and determination. For instance, Oprah Winfrey started out as a talk show host and has since become one of the most influential people in the world. She worked hard to build her career and has used her success to inspire and empower others.  Additionally, we can see the impact of taking action in our own lives. When I was in college, I had a goal of graduating with honors. I knew that this would require me to put in a lot of hard work and dedication, but I was determined to achieve it. I studied every day, attended all of my classes, and sought out opportunities to excel in my studies. As a result, I graduated with honors and was able to pursue my dream career.  In conclusion, it is clear that taking action is essential to achieving our goals in life. We need to have a clear sense of purpose and determination, and be willing to put in the effort to make our goals a reality. By working hard and taking action, we can achieve great things in life and make a positive impact on the world.		1
Cars have been a great way of transportation that has been around since the early days. It's a fast and simple way of getting to where you need to be at the right time. However, there are many downsides to cars, also, especially when it deals with environmental circumstances. Therefore, car use should be limited due the fact that limiting car use will reduce greenhouse gasses, conserve resources we need in order to live that is nonrenewable, and allows for communities to be more connected by preserving the environment.  To begin with, car usage is becoming a major issue for the world today due to pollution. Greenhouse gasses are being leaked into the atmosphere each day to cars' transmission fuels. According to Source 1, it states, "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States." These gasses damage ecosystems, and leave many environments unstable due to its destruction. It can also effect human beings, also. According to Source 2, the passage says, "Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found." This pollution that is occurring around the world can damage our health if not taken care of. By limiting car usage, it would not only benefit the environment, but our health also.  Preceding on, along with the benefits of the environment and our health, limiting car usage will also save help save many resources we use in cars that is nonrenewable resources. Nonrenewable resources are resources that can not be replaced when it is used up. These resources are resources that are important to our every day lives, as we've gotten used to having these resources and would suffer without them. According to Source 2, it states, "Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has... a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compares to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters." Diesel is an important nonrenewable resource that we need that is causing pollution and smog in many places. By limiting the car usage, it would conserve these resources.  furthermore, limiting car usage would also help bring many communities together. If a whole community got together and decided to limit car usage with the whole community involved, it would give a sense of unity and benefit the community, also. An example of this was the residents of Vauban, Germany. In Source 1, the passage states "As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. 'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor." Due to the limiting of driving cars, many people actually felt more of a sens of relief rather than with cars. In Source 3, it says, " Bogota, Colombia In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoif of traffic jams. It was the third straight yeat cars have been permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog." This community was able to come together as a whole in order to reach the goal of reducing smog and allowing for an alternative transportation method. By limiting car usage, communities are able to act more of a community rather than individuals.  All in all, limiting car usage would be beneficial to the world. The advantages of limiting car usage would be the reduction of greenhouse gasses and smog, the conservation of nonrenewable resources used in cars, and making communities stronger by coming together to stop the driving of cars. Cars are a big and major part of the world today, but it can be more beneficial to limit it rather than continue it.		0
In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author does mention "a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. There are many challenge's to studying venus. "On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. " The author mentions challenges that we face in order to study venus. The author states "Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." While they are many challenges that scientists, and that people may face, Venus is worthy of being studied. Nasa's possible solution to thhe hostile conditions on the surface on Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. They are many ways Venus can be studied, with NASA's solution , we are closer to discovering the many secrets of venus. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. 		0
The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could provide both benefits and risks. On one hand, this technology may help teachers gain insights into how their students are feeling and whether they are engaged or struggling. Identifying when students appear bored, confused or frustrated could help teachers improve their lessons to better meet students' needs. It may also reveal when students are deeply engaged and absorbing the material, allowing teachers to use similar teaching strategies more often. However, this technology also raises privacy concerns. Continually monitoring students' facial expressions without their consent could be seen as invasive and make some students feel uncomfortable naturally expressing a full range of emotions. It may also lead to misinterpretations of students if the technology incorrectly analyzes their facial expressions. Before using this technology in classrooms, schools would need to put strict privacy policies in place to gain students' and parents' trust. Overall, while FACS could provide benefits if used carefully and discreetly, the risks to student privacy mean it may not be appropriate or useful for the classroom at this time. More research on the accuracy and appropriate use of this technology is still needed.		1
Dear Mrs. Smith,  I think that policy 1 is the better choice for our school. I know some people might say that having phones at school is a distraction, but I think it's important for us to have access to our phones during emergencies. Like, what if someone's parents need to reach them? Or what if there's a school shooting and we need to call 911? It's important to be able to communicate in situations like that.  Also, being able to use our phones during lunch and free time is a good way to relax and socialize. We're not always in class, and it's nice to be able to check our social media or play games during breaks. It's like a little reward for working hard in class.  I know some people might say that phones are a distraction, but I think that's not true. If we're responsible and turn our phones off during class, then there's no problem. And if we can't turn them off, then maybe we need to work on our self-control. But I don't think we should be punished for something that's not our fault.  I also want to say that policy 2 is too strict. I know some schools don't allow phones at all, but that's not realistic. Phones are a part of our lives now, and we need to learn how to use them responsibly. By allowing us to have phones at school, we can learn how to use them in a way that's appropriate for school.  So, I think policy 1 is the better choice. It allows us to have our phones, but still maintains a level of respect for the classroom. And it teaches us how to be responsible with our technology.  Thank you for considering our opinions.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
One day when they were seing how to lande they spoted a face on the red planet mars. It all started like this there were viking 1 was looking for a clear space so his siter viking 2 could lande in the planet mars. So they were looking with the ship camaro to see for a clear spot when they spoted some thing looking straight at the camara and they took a picture because they dint knew what it was. So when they got back home they took a copy of it so the scientist could see what it was. Then when they were looking at it the said it was a face and then everyone started asking queestion.  Also the it wasent the body it was just a humen head with"form shadows given illisuin in eye its nose and mouth". So when they saw it had all the stuff they whent back to se it again whe the misioon was over for the viking 1 and viking 2 .Also this time there camara system was way beter then imn 1988 so they took some more photographgs .Then when they came back they kept on studieng it even more and it took them aloong time to figer it out untile whan day the finally knew what it was. So they setteld a miting for everyone come back in one place and when everyone was ready the scientist said that it was just the dust that had made a pile of mountin making it look like it was a humen face so they said it was just a natural landform. So when that hapend every one was bumed because they thought that they had actully found live in a nother planet called the red planet.  So everyone was happie because they actully thought they found live in mars but the dint. After that they just left the mission stuff were they were because they were sad because there was no live they just left every thing were it was. So what the picture actully shwode was the martin equivalent of a butt or mesa land forms common around the american. After all that hapend the whole story was about the face and mars and if there was live.        		0
 Dear State Senator,  Presently, the Electoral College determines the election of the President of the United States. Each state is allocated a number of electoral votes equivalent to its number of Senators and Representatives in Congress. Although the popular vote is not ignored, it is not the only deciding factor in the election process. The candidate with the most votes in a state wins all of its electoral votes, regardless of the margin of victory. This system benefits candidates who focus their campaigns on a handful of "battleground" states while largely ignoring the others. While this is not a significant issue in most elections, this problem becomes glaring in elections with contentious results, such as the 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, where despite winning the national popular vote, Gore lost the election due to winning fewer states.   Many argue that the Electoral College is an integral part of the U.S. Constitution and that it would be disastrous to change it. On the contrary, the fact that the Electoral College is part of the Constitution is not an argument for keeping it. The Constitution is a living document that should reflect the current values and beliefs of the people it governs. It's worth noting that the Constitution has been amended numerous times throughout history, including to expand voting rights. One of the biggest arguments for the Electoral College is that it ensures that all areas of the United States are represented in the election of the President. However, this is not a strong argument as it is possible for a candidate to win the election without winning the popular vote, which happens quite often.   Another point often raised in defense of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign in all areas of the country and not just in densely populated urban areas. However, with the rise of social media and other forms of online advertising, candidates can reach potential voters in rural areas without having to physically visit every nook and cranny of the country.   On the other hand, there are several compelling arguments in favor of switching to a popular vote system. Firstly, it would ensure that the President is elected by the people, not by a group of elected officials. This would reinforce the idea that the President is the people's representative and is accountable to them. Secondly, a popular vote would encourage candidates to appeal to a broader cross-section of the population and not just those in swing states. This would likely result in more inclusive and comprehensive campaigns. Finally, a popular vote would make it easier to audit the election results, as there would only be one set of data to scrutinize, rather than multiple sets from each state.   In conclusion, the Electoral College no longer serves its original purpose and has become an anachronism in our democratic system. It is time for a change. The popular vote would ensure that the President is elected by the people and would lead to more inclusive campaigns. For these reasons, I urge you to support a switch to a popular vote for President.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
Dear State Senator, I think we should get rid of the electoral college because they are unfair. There are only a few reasons to why we need the electoral college. I think we should get rid the college because it is a non democratic method of selecting our president. It should be overruled by declaring the candidate who got the most popular votes. Its the electors who select the president not the people. When you vote, you are actually voting for a slate of electors.  Another reason why would get rid of the electoral college is because of the winner takes all system. Canadiates dont spend time in the states they know have no chance of winning. They only focused on the tight races in the "swing" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see the the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not see a single campaign.  It can be argued that the electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, demo crates in texas, or reblicans in California for example. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign thean they would have if the president were picked by popular vote... The voters in presidential elections are people who to want to express a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.  Whats wrong the electoral College?  When we are under the electoral College system , voters vot not for the president, but they vote for slate of electors. For example if you lived in texas and wanted to vote for John kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electorial votes. These electors could be anyone not holding public office. Plus voters can not control who the electors vote for. Voters end up getting confused because of the candidates the electors vote for.		0
 Essay: The Face on Mars  Mankind has been exploring and studying Mars for decades, and yet there is still so much that remains unknown about the planet. One of the most intriguing and mysterious features of Mars is the so-called "Face on Mars," a colossal structure that appears to be the face of a giant being looking down at Earth.  The Face on Mars was first noticed from space by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh in 1992. Using the telescope at his home in New York, Tombaugh was able to capture high-resolution images of Mars that revealed the striking feature. Since then, the Face on Mars has been studied extensively by scientists and astronomers around the world.  Many researchers have speculated about the origins and meaning of the Face on Mars. Some have suggested that it may be a kind of ancient monument or artificial structure, built by an extinct civilization on Mars. Others have proposed that it may be the remains of an enormous volcanic eruption, or even a meteor impact site.  Some scientists have even suggested that the Face on Mars may be a form of advanced extraterrestrial intelligence. According to this theory, the Face may be the work of an advanced civilization that once lived on Mars and was able to create a monument or structure of this size and scale using advanced technology.  However, despite the many theories and speculation surrounding the Face on Mars, there is still no definitive answer about what it is or where it came from. Many scientists and researchers believe that the Face on Mars is simply a natural geological feature and may have been created by the movement and erosion of the Martian surface over time.  In conclusion, the Face on Mars remains one of the most fascinating and mysterious features of the planet. While there are many theories and speculations about its origins and meaning, there is still no definitive answer. It remains a reminder that there is still so much that remains unknown about the universe and the planets we explore. Ultimately, the Face on Mars is a humbling reminder of the vastness of the cosmos and the incredible mysteries that await us out there.		1
In more recent human years, travel has grown and grown and grown, when taking a horse from one side of America to the other would have taken countless years in the past, now we get in our cars, hop on to US1 and drive for a few days and we are on the other side of the country. Cars have connected people all over the world, allowing them to reach loved ones, and friends and family easier then ever. Although with every good thing comes some bad. Cars run on gas, and when¬† they use the gas they cause pollution, that is slowly destroying the earth, second driving a car can encourage people not to walk and exercise since they can just push a pedal and go as fast as they need for as long as they need, finally running a car costs lots of money. Having to fix up the car and pay for gas to run the car, people without cars would have lots more money to spend on other nessesities like food and water.  But with todays technology it doesent really matter if you drive or not, cars are becoming more fuel efficient and even hybrid, the amount of benefits to negatives really does not balance out, being able to go anywhere or being 0.00000001% help for the environment, also driving cars creates jobs for people everywhere, designers, mechanics, gas station workers, etc. So although, yes not driving would help the environment, it would also cause hundreds of thousands of people to lose their jobs, crippling the environment and destroying america, a country that basically survives off car sales. When your wife is giving birth and it takes 30 mins to drive to the hospital, are you going to be happy that you sold your car to save the environment?    		0
 Car-free cities offer a unique and valuable model for urban planning and transportation. As the world becomes increasingly concerned about the negative impact of cars on the environment, traffic congestion, and air pollution, the idea of car-free cities is gaining popularity.  One of the key advantages of car-free cities is that they encourage walking and cycling, which are healthier modes of transportation. By removing cars from the city, people are forced to use alternative modes of transportation that require physical activity, which can have numerous health benefits. In addition, car-free cities often have dedicated bike lanes and pedestrian pathways, making it easier and safer to walk and ride bikes.  Car-free cities also reduce air pollution and congestion caused by cars. Cars are responsible for a significant amount of air pollution in cities, and they can also contribute to traffic congestion, which can be frustrating and dangerous for residents. By eliminating cars from the city, car-free cities reduce the amount of pollution and congestion, making the city a more pleasant and livable place to be.  Car-free cities also require less space for parking and garages, which can free up valuable urban land for other uses. In many cities, parking is a major expense, and it can take up a significant amount of space. Car-free cities eliminate this need, which can be used for more productive purposes such as housing or commercial development.  Finally, car-free cities are often more connected to their surroundings, as people are able to explore and interact with their neighborhood on foot or by bike. This can create a sense of community and a more engaged and active urban environment.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer numerous advantages for residents and the environment. They promote healthier modes of transportation, reduce air pollution and congestion, free up valuable urban land, and create a more connected and active urban environment. As concerns about the negative impact of cars on cities continue to grow, car-free cities could serve as a valuable model for urban planning and transportation in the future.		1

 In my opinion, school districts should allow students to graduate a year early if they have completed the required courses. While it may seem like students are attending school for less time, they are still putting in the same amount of effort and time into their studies as their peers. If students can handle the equivalent of junior and senior year in the same year, it shows their dedication and hard work, which can benefit them in various ways.  Firstly, graduating a year early could impress colleges and universities that the student is already familiar with the stress of college-level courses. This can put them in a better position when it comes to organization and being on time. Additionally, students who choose to enter the workforce after graduation can have a head start on their careers, which can be especially beneficial for those who may be facing financial difficulties within their families.  While there may be some challenges associated with graduating a year early, such as increased stress and time management, these obstacles are limited to the school year. In conclusion, allowing students to graduate early can be a valuable opportunity for them to demonstrate their dedication and hard work, which can have long-term benefits for their future careers and personal lives.		1
Well i myself STUDENT_NAME  think that all thee Principal's should allow all students to bring cell phones to school an use them during lunch an other free time , as long as they have there phones off during class time. Myself would think that us student should be allowed cell phones because, maybe the student walk home, ride a bus or even maybe the school is on lock down etc. That way student will be able to get a hold of somebody in case something horrible has happen.  Then after all when school comes around student should turn there cell phone off or on silent during class, because you have to get your Education!! Your most important thing when your at school is too get your education an not too get distracted on your cellular when you are at school .  But also still allow them at school. so that's what i would do if i was ever a principal at a school!		0
To Achieving Success in School  As an eighth-grade student, I have observed two different strategies that my friends have used to improve their grades. These strategies are effective and can be used to create a plan for success in school. In this essay, I will identify these strategies, research factors that affect student success in school, analyze current achievements, compare the two friends' approaches to success, analyze the importance of relationships to success, and evaluate how good actions can lead to achieving success in school.  The first strategy that my friends have used to improve their grades is time management. They have learned how to prioritize their tasks and allocate their time effectively. They have also learned how to avoid procrastination and stay focused on their work. By managing their time effectively, they have been able to complete their assignments on time and achieve higher grades.  The second strategy that my friends have used to improve their grades is seeking help when needed. They have learned that it is okay to ask for help from their teachers, tutors, or peers. They have also learned how to identify their strengths and weaknesses and focus on improving their weak areas. By seeking help when needed, they have been able to overcome their challenges and achieve better grades.  Research has shown that time management and seeking help are two critical factors that affect student success in school. Time management helps students to prioritize their tasks and avoid procrastination, which can lead to better grades. Seeking help when needed helps students to overcome their challenges and achieve better grades.  Currently, my friends have achieved higher grades than in the past. They have also developed better time management skills and are seeking help when needed. Their achievements are similar in that they have both improved their grades, but different in that they have used different strategies to achieve their success.  The two friends' approaches to success are different in that one has focused on time management, while the other has focused on seeking help when needed. The friend who has focused on time management has learned how to prioritize their tasks and avoid procrastination, while the friend who has focused on seeking help when needed has learned how to identify their strengths and weaknesses and focus on improving their weak areas.  Relationships are also critical to success in school. Having supportive relationships with teachers, peers, and family members can help students to stay motivated and focused on their goals. To establish supportive relationships, students		1
In the article, the author goes into great detail about the exploration of Venus. He goes into great detail because he wants everyone to know that Venus is a facinating planet worth exploring. Venus has many challenges, but we can go and explore this odd and facinating planet.  The author wants everone to explore Venus because he belevies that the challenges that Venus presents shouldn't hold us back from exploring it. In the article it says, "  Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." The author also presents the readers with ideas on how to approach the studying of Venus. For example, in the text it says, " NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplifed electronics made from silicon carbide have been test in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions." He also states that they are other benefits to exploring Venus like learning about the history of the planet. In the text it states, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."  The author did a very good job expaining why we should study Venus. He has givin lots of good information and evidence supporting his claim. The author has also givin us many reasons on why we should study Venus. Although there are some challenges, we should overcome them and find a way to explore Venus.		0
Not all students should have to do community service because they might have things to do, and wont have enough time to do community service. If the students like doing community service then the principal should let those students have a club were they can do stuff for the community. So those students can then do what they like. It makes it better to so the people in charge of the club can watch the students to see that they are actually doing community service. as for if the principle made every student do community service they might not have time to do homework or have time for other things. Another thing the students might do is just lie about it. They can just tell the principal that they did community service when they really didn't. So then it would just end up being a waste of time. Soon every one will start lying about it because it will start to get annoying and nobody is going to want to do it. This is y not all students should do community service.		0
When it comes to achieving goals, the process is no easy feat. Winston Churchill once famously said, ‚ÄúSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts. ?To truly achieve success, one must be willing to persevere through the difficult obstacles that stand in the way. Everyone‚Äôs journey to success shares a common formula: start with a goal in mind, brainstorm a plan of action, find the motivation to keep going, and learn from mistakes along the way.   Every individual journey is unique, because goals come in various shapes and sizes. While some goals may take days to accomplish, others may take years. Achievers must be ready for long periods of hard work and dedication, as well as the frequent curve balls that life throws our way. Beyond facing our own personal fears and challenges, we must also be prepared to encounter external hindrances such as limited resources, financial constraints, and the unexpected opposition of others. Learning to navigate these situations with compassion and humility can be one of the greatest lessons on the road to success.   Through hardship and struggle come moments of triumph and reward. After months or even years of hard work, reaching our goals can be one of the most fulfilling and rewarding experiences. In such moments, we are often humbled by the people who believed in us, supportive of us, and pushed us to remain on track. Most of all, we take pride in the idea that our hard work has paid off and our goals have been accomplished.   In conclusion, no success story is an overnight one. The process of achieving goals is one that involves overcoming numerous difficulties, yet the rewards of success can be deeply gratifying and yield a sense of accomplishment and pride. Through this journey, we not only learn valuable lessons but also build character and develop greater resilience for the future.		1
Some people believe that The Face on Mars was created by aliens. It's good to use your imaginations, but sadly, that wouldn't be the case. Most to even all evidence proves that The Face is simply a natural landform on Mars, similar to natural landforms on Earth. It's a common happening, and the most logical answer.  Us scientists at NASA have been researching The Face for years. Sure, the first picture of The Face did resemble that of a human face, or an Egyptian Pharaoh as it says in paragraph 2 of the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars", but since then we've been able to get better, higher-quality pictures that show that what made The Face look like a face was simply shadows. The Face is a landform on Mars, and that's simply it. It's similar to "landforms common around the American West", as it states in paragraph twelve, it's the "Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa" here on Earth.  If that doesn't convince you that it's not aliens that created The Face, hopefully this will. In paragraph 5 of the article on The Face, it states "Some people think the Face is 'bona fide' evidence of life on Mars -- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists." This isn't true. If NASA were to find life on Mars, it would benefit us. We wouldn't have a reason to hide it. As proof, that's also stated in paragraph 5, "defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars." Now, if defenders of our budget wish that there were ancient civilizations on Mars, don't you think we wouldn't hide it? This shows that it would benefit us if it were that, proving further that aliens aren't the creators of The Face.  If you're still not convinced, look at the picture we took of The Face on April 5, 1998, "when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time". NASA got a picture "ten times sharper than the original Viking photos", as stated in paragraph 7. This means that it was much easier to see The Face, and what it actually was. The pictures revealed something amazing... the Face was "a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." I know, shocking! But these are just the facts. Some argued that is was cloudy that day on Mars, so "alien markings were hidden by haze", as it states in paragraph 8. So we took a better picture on April 8, 2001 - an uncloudy day on Mars - showing, again, that it was just a landform. Nothing more to it.  In conclusion, the Face is just a natural landform on Mars, similar to those here on our home planet, Earth. As far as anyone knows, even NASA, there are no life-forms on Mars of any kind that made The Face. As it says in paragraph 12, the pictures we took on April 8 were so high-quality that ""if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" If there were any kind of aliens or alien markings on the Face, or creating the Face at that time, you would have been able to see it in that picture. The Face "is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa", landforms commonly seen here on Earth. That's all there is to it. No aliens. No magic. Just natural happenings, that's simply all the Face is. 		0
Ummm, hey there!  So, like, I'm gonna try my best to write this essay about why I'm the perfect candidate for a job, ya know?   Okay, so, I think I'm a pretty good people person. Like, I've been in school with the same people for, like, ever, and we're all friends and stuff. We, like, hang out and stuff, and I'm always there for them when they need me.  And, like, I've also worked at a camp for kids during the summer, and I gotta say, I'm pretty good at makin' 'em feel welcome and stuff.   And, umm, I'm also willing to work extra hours!  Like, I know my teachers would tell you that I'm always the first one to offer to stay after school to help with stuff, or to come in on the weekends to finish projects.  I just wanna get the job done right, you know?   Oh, and, like, I'm a hard worker!  I mean, I'm not gonna lie, sometimes I get distracted and stuff, but I always try my best to focus and get the job done.  I'm always willing to put in the extra effort to make sure things are done right, and I'm not gonna give up just 'cause it's hard.   So, yeah, I think I'd be a pretty good candidate for a job!  I'm friendly, willing to work extra hours, and a hard worker.  What more could you want in a candidate?  Thanks for reading my essay!		1
Dear State Senator,  You should keep the electoral college vote the same without the popular vote because the winning candiate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Aswell as the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives majority of the votes cast.  To begin, the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invairably exceeds his share of the popular vote. for example in the 2012 election, Oboma received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is very possible like the total number of votes-538-is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. It is less likely to have a dispute over the popular vote but it is more likely to have a dispute over the electoral vote. In 2012's election voters in toss-up states are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing canidates- knowing they are going to decide the election. Causing the popualr vote to go up. When we as a community should not want to president be chosen by a popular vote but by the electoral vote, it is only fair!  Also, the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning the majority in the electoral college. Did you know that there is someone from a small state and they only get three electoral votes. Well, they are not treated equal and only the large states get more of the attention from presidential candidates than a small state ever will.  It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. You should keep the electoral college vote the same without the popular vote because the winning candiate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Aswell as the electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives majority of the votes cast. So I'm going to leave you with this. What will you choose? The popular vote of the electoral vote? It's up to you not.  Sincerly,  An american Citizen.       ¬†    		0
It has been statistically documented that cellphone-related accidents are increasing at an alarming rate. The usage of phone apps, texting, GPS mapping for directions, and social media sites have caused new laws and penalties to be passed due to cellphone-related injuries and deaths. In my opinion, drivers cell phone usage should be limited while driving with the usage of features such as hands-free options which should be mandatory.  According to the National Safety Council, 2019 Texting-While-Driving Report; the average cellphone related deaths is roughly 1,600,000 accidents per year. The top two most common distractions of automobile drivers are: talking on a cell phone and sending text messages.  Nationally the state of Georgia ranks number four by Expert Market research (www. expertmarket. com) with an average of 132.7 Fatal Crashes Caused by Cell Phones.  However, the number of accidents caused by cell phone use while driving is severely under- reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (www. nhtsa. gov/distracted-driving). The issues of cellphone related problems with Fatal Crashes Caused by Cell Phones continue to grow when you consider the victims who have either died or experienced severe injuries by vehicle operators who have struck bystanders due to a simple message or post.  Even though the statistics cause concern advocates for public safety feel that cell phone use while driving can be lifesaving for onsite emergencies, roadside assistance, and even responding to Amber Alerts. Both sides have valid arguments that have increased major phone carriers and company's like Apple Inc. have creating phone features such as voice activated Hands-free Calling, Do Not Disturb, and Disable While Driving to help minimize the possibility of anything cell-phone related occurring,  In conclusion, I feel that in the future cell phones and automobiles including cargo trucks alone will have driver algorithm and functions that will help decrease problems with cell phone- related driver issues. I do not feel that it is necessary to completely eliminate operating a cell phone while driving in case of a emergency especially health related or to even report kidnapping & human-trafficking which is a huge problem for the state of Georgia and nationally. Drivers need to be more mindful and obey the laws or be penalized by the new laws meant to protect people.   		0
Have you ever wonder how it would feel to know how a person felt in a picture, painting or any other thing or even if they hide their emotions? I feel like that would be such a great thing to have a piece of technology. I believe that this technology is valuable because so many people might have courosity to know what a person felt in a pictures, painting, ect. In this essay I will be arguing, why I feel this piece of technology is valuble, and what differnce would it make to society.  Technology is a major part of our lives, but having a piece of technology that can read a persons emotion is a pretty impressive on how we have advanced in technology. The Beckman Institute for Advanced science at the University of Illinois was capable to make a software that can read people's emotions. the author states," at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions". This proves that now theres something that can study a persons emotions.  Technology has made a big differnce between the years and to have a software that can read a persons emotions is such a huge expanced on what we know. Now that we have a software that reads a persons emotion can really make a really big differnce of society. The author states, " the facial expression for each emotion are universal, usinf video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software can even identify mixed emotions".  This proves that the new software is going to make such a huge differnce to our society.  To conclude, Technology is such a valuble pesesion we have in our lives. By having a software that can read emotions is a big step on making this world big. Many won't believe the same but most people in this world are involved with technology and this is going to change throughout the decades. Do you believe that this technology is valuble?		0
I believe driving should be in the hands of humans along with the assistance of a machine.  Having autonomous care can enbale us to do different things while driving.  With the extra control over the car, we can make the roads safer while we multi-task on the road.  Semi- autonomous cars can help us get to a hospital if we are sick or injured and are unable to drive.  If a parent needs to take care of a child in the backseat, she can reach back and take care of the child without having to worry about the road as well.  These systems can also teach people how to drive behind the wheel; and if there is a problem, the car can take control and keep others safe as well as the driver.  Kids that are working to get their liscense could have more experience driving alone since the system in the car is there to help in case of a problem.  But that wont completely destroy the purpose of needing a liscense to drive becasue people will still need to know how to drive since the car is not always in full control.  In conclusion, fully automated cars may not be the best thing due to their inability to judge and react to situations.  Semi- autonomous vehicles can assist us in the vehicle, but can still be controlled with our quick reactions in case of a problem.  Instead of giving all control to the machine, the driver and the car should work together to preserve the safety of themselves and others around them.        		0
Dear Principal,   I am writing regarding your consideration of whether to require all students to perform community service. While helping the community is certainly a noble endeavor, I do not think mandatory service is the best approach. There are several reasons for my position.  Firstly, requiring community service risk taking away students' freedom to choose how to spend their free time. Some students need that time for other commitments like jobs, family responsibilities or personal hobbies and interests. Community service should be a choice undertaken willingly rather than an obligation. Forced participation is unlikely to foster true care and commitment to bettering one's community.   Secondly, mandatory service may breed resentment in students who do not see the value in their assigned tasks. When participation is not motivated by personal conviction, the quality and enthusiasm of one's work will likely be compromised. This defeats the purpose of community service which is meant to uplift both the server and those being served. Dissatisfied volunteers are unlikely to make a meaningful impact.  Instead of requiring all students to participate, I believe a better approach would be to educate students about opportunities for voluntary community service and encourage those who are willing and able. Recognizing students' efforts with awards or extra credits could further incentivize participation without forcing the issue. This keeps service as an extracurricular choice for those passionate about helping others, allowing students' differing priorities and schedules to be respected.  In conclusion, while the intention behind mandatory community service is understandable, I do not think obliging participation is the right solution. Community partnerships work best when driven by personal altruism rather than external demands. For these reasons, I do not recommend making service a universal requirement for all students. Voluntary opportunities coupled with recognition of efforts seem a preferred alternative approach.  Thank you for considering my perspective. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.  Sincerely, [Your name]		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College. As you know, the Electoral College is a system in which each state is allocated a number of electors equal to its number of senators plus its number of representatives in the House of Representatives. These electors are then responsible for casting their votes for president and vice president.  The Electoral College was created at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 as a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by Congress and those who wanted the president to be elected by a popular vote of the people. The Electoral College was designed to give equal representation to all states, regardless of population. However, the Electoral College has become increasingly obsolete in the 21st century.  In recent years, there have been several elections in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. In 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the election to George W. Bush. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but lost the election to Donald Trump.  The Electoral College is undemocratic because it allows a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote. In 2016, Trump won the presidency even though he lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. This is due to the fact that Trump won a majority of the electoral votes in the so-called "swing states," which are states that are not reliably Republican or Democratic.  The Electoral College also gives too much power to a small number of states. In 2016, Trump won the presidency even though he lost the popular vote in 30 states. This is because Trump won the electoral votes in a handful of states, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. These states are known as "battleground states" because they are usually up for grabs in presidential elections.  The Electoral College also discourages voter participation. In states that are reliably Democratic or Republican, many voters feel that their vote does not matter because their state will always go to the same candidate. This is known as the "spoiler effect."  In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that should be abolished. I urge you to support legislation that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the president by popular vote.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
In the world we live in, everyone has a cell phone. Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. They should not because it is a distraction, and the call or text can wait.  The call or text can wait because you have to take your eyes off the road to answer or reply. Many times when you're texting and driving you misspell words and then you have to go back and correct it. So therefore when you go back and correct it your eyes are still off the road. This also means you are risking your life and someone else's life by being on the phone . In addition this leads to my next reason.  Cell phones are a distraction. They are a distraction because if you get a notification you're going to look for your phone. You can look down for 1 second and anything can happen. Also when people talk on the phone they are distracted. They have a tendency to look ways that they aren't supposed to and they drive crazy.  In conclusion drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. It is a distraction and the call or text can wait. Remember when you drive you have to drive for yourself and drive for others too. So try to avoid texting or answering and call while driving especially if it's just a friend.   		0
 Some students graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years in high school. While some people believe that four years in high school is sufficient for students to be successful in life, I disagree. In my opinion, students need four years in high school to fully understand their future career paths and to prepare themselves for college.  Graduating in three years may seem like a good option for some students, as it allows them to finish their high school education one year earlier. However, this can be a disadvantage for students who want to pursue careers that require more time and education. For example, students who want to become mechanics or engineers need to take more classes and gain more knowledge about their field before they can graduate. By graduating in three years, they may not have enough time to fully understand their chosen career path and may not be fully prepared for the challenges they will face in college.  Additionally, some people argue that graduating early is not a good idea because it may not fully prepare students for college. College is a serious commitment and requires a high level of dedication and hard work. Students who graduate early may not have had enough time to fully understand the expectations and responsibilities that come with college. This could lead to academic difficulties and a lack of motivation in college.  On the other hand, some students may choose to graduate early for practical reasons, such as to help their families or to start working right away. While these reasons may be valid, it is important for students to understand that graduating early is not always the best option. Students who graduate early may not have had enough time to fully understand their chosen career path, and may not be fully prepared for the challenges they will face in college.  In conclusion, while graduating in three years may seem like a good option for some students, I believe that four years in high school is the best option for students to be successful in life. By taking the time to fully understand their chosen career path and to prepare themselves for college, students will be better equipped to succeed in their future endeavors.		1
Dear principle  I believe that the first policy is the better one to allow. I think that the first policy is better because kids should be able to have there phones just in case of emergency. I also think kids should have there phones because if your at lunch you should be able to use you're phone. And the last reason i think the first policy is better is because you can yous them for math.  The first reason think you should be able to have your phone in school is in case of and emergency. For example if you have to catch the bus home. Another example is if you have to go to a friends house. And lastly is because your parents might need to contact you.  My second reason i think that the first policy is better is because if your going to be at lunch or free time your not going to be doing any work. For example you can play a game on your phone. Another example is you can text your friends that might be on the other side of the lunch room. And the last example is so that you can make a phone call  The last reason that i think that the first policy is better is because you could use them use them for math. For example if you need to use the calculator. Another example is so that you can put you notes that you take in class and put them in your phone. The last example is so that you can play with is when your done your test.  As you can see i clearly believe that the first policy is better than the second policy.		0
 The electoral college is a group of electors that are appointed by each state to choose the president of the United States. The idea behind the electoral college is that each state gets a certain number of electoral votes based on its population, giving smaller states more influence in the election than larger states. However, there are many arguments for and against the electoral college, and its effectiveness as a means of choosing the president is often called into question.   One of the main arguments against the electoral college is that it does not give each individual vote equal weight. In the United States, the president is elected by a group of electors rather than by individual voters. This means that the votes of large states are worth more than the votes of small states. For example, in the 2008 presidential election, California had 55 electoral votes, while Wyoming had only three electoral votes. This means that one vote in California is worth much more than one vote in Wyoming.  Another argument against the electoral college is that it can make the election results less representative of the will of the people. The electoral college is based on the popular vote in each state, but this can be distorted by factors like voter turnout, population shifts, and campaign spending. For example, in the 2016 presidential election, many voters in swing states felt frustrated with their options and did not turn out to vote, which may have contributed to Donald Trump's victory.  On the other hand, there are also arguments in favor of the electoral college. One of the main arguments is that it ensures that the president is elected by the whole country and not just by a few large cities. This is because each state has a certain number of electoral votes, and these votes come from all of the states, not just the most populous cities. This can help to avoid the situation where a candidate wins the presidency by narrowly winning a few key cities, while losing the popular vote nationwide.  Another argument in favor of the electoral college is that it can help to preserve the smaller states in the United States. Because smaller states are given fewer electoral votes, they have more influence in the election. This can help to ensure that the interests of smaller states are represented in the federal government. In addition, smaller states are often more closely knit communities where the local politicians have a greater impact on the people's lives.  In conclusion, the electoral college is a system used to choose the president of the United States. It has both advantages and disadvantages, and its effectiveness is a matter of debate. On the one hand, it can ensure that the president is elected by the whole country and not just by a few large cities, as well as preserve the smaller states in the United States. On the other hand, it can make the election results less representative of the will of the people and distort the importance of individual votes. Ultimately, it is up to the courts and policymakers to decide whether the electoral college is an effective and fair way to choose the		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.  The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that gives disproportionate power to the votes of citizens in certain states. In the 2016 election, for example, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College and became President. This is not the first time that the Electoral College has resulted in a President who did not win the popular vote; it has happened five times in American history.  There are several reasons why I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. First, it is undemocratic. In a democratic society, the person who receives the most votes should be elected. The Electoral College system undermines this principle by allowing a candidate to win the Presidency without winning the popular vote.  Second, the Electoral College gives disproportionate power to the votes of citizens in certain states. The number of electoral votes that a state has is based on its population, but each state has at least three electoral votes, regardless of its population. This means that a voter in Wyoming has more than three times the voting power of a voter in California.  Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a small number of "swing states" where the election is likely to be close. This means that candidates ignore the needs of voters in states that are considered "safe" for one party or the other.  I believe that the best way to elect the President of the United States is by popular vote. This would ensure that the person who receives the most votes wins the Presidency, and it would give all voters an equal voice in the election.  I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President by popular vote.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Senator [Name],  I hope this letter finds you well. I‚Äôm writing to share my thoughts on one of the foundational pillars of our democratic process - the Electoral College. Over time, the debate over its efficiency and fairness has created a significant divide between those who advocate for reform and proponents of the original system. It is a complex issue with arguments on both sides, but I believe it is critical to maintain the Electoral College as it serves several essential functions in preserving the integrity and stability of our elections.  The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College as a compromise, balancing the power between Congress and the people in electing the President (Office of the Federal Register). This compromise ensures more equitable representation across states, particularly for smaller or less-populated states. Under the system, every state is allocated a number of electors equal to their Congressional delegation, allowing smaller states to have an impact proportionate to their size (Office of the Federal Register).   Moreover, the Electoral College adds certainty to the election outcome and invariably produces a clear winner (Judge Richard A. Posner). An electoral dispute is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote, thanks to the ‚Äúwinner-take-all ?system which creates a landslide electoral-vote victory even with the slightest plurality. This system prevents the complication of potential run-off elections in case no candidate receives a majority of the vote (Judge Richard A. Posner).  Critics claim that the system is undemocratic and unfair, suggesting a direct election instead. They argue the Electoral College allows for a possibility where a candidate could win the popular vote but fail to secure the presidency (Bradford Plumer). However, this occurrence is minimal, with only a few exceptions in the history of U.S. presidential elections (Judge Richard A. Posner).  Nevertheless, it is crucial to address the concerns raised by critics, particularly relating to fairness and representation. Some argue that the ‚Äúwinner-take-all ?system discourages candidates from campaigning in states they are predicted to lose, limiting the election discourse to ‚Äúswing ?states (Bradford Plumer). This argument certainly holds weight and is something that should be considered in any discussions of reform.  In conclusion, the Electoral College, despite criticisms, is imperfectly perfect. Its pros outweigh the cons, ensuring regional representation, reducing the likelihood of electoral disputes, and importantly, eradicating the need for potentially divisive run-offs.   Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider calls for reform to enhance the perceived fairness of the process. It is my hope that you will consider this perspective when addressing this issue in the legislature.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
The electoral college is unfiar to voters. Electing the president should not be on how many electors vote for the candidate, it should be about how many people in each state vote for this representative. The electoral college is only 538 electors that vote for president which is not everyone that goes to the election booth and votes for president. In the electoral college, voters do not vote for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the preisdent. Over 60 perecnt of the voters prefer direct election instead of the electoral college.  Voting for president should be about the number of people who vote for a candidate. Voting should not be about the number of electors each candidate has. Direct voting is what should be taking place, not an electoral college. Direct voting is when a voter goes to an election booth and votes for who they think should be president. Their vote does not get sent to an electoral college where electors vote for the candidate. Every voter goes to an election booth to vote the candidate they think should be president, they dont vote for the electors.  "The electoral college is unfair,outdated and irrational." This is true because with the electoral college, voters vote not for a slate of the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. The electoral college's only purpose is so the candidate can have agroup of electors just in case the number of votes is low for the candidate. The electors votes are the only votes that really matter which is not fair to the voters. Out of everyone that votes for president and having only 538 votes count does not seem fair to the voters at all.  Over 60 percent of voters prefer direct election. 60 percent is the majority of voters the rather have direct election instead of the electoral college. Since most of the time it is majority rules then why not cut the electoral college from the voting process? I'll tell you why, because ever since the disaster hat occured in 2000, the candidates still need a chance at winning the election even¬† if they do not get to visit every state during the campaign.  Yes, the electoral college is unfair and irrantional but it has also created a new system known as the winner-takes-all system. This system allows the candidates to focus on the states that they do have a chance winning over instead of focusing on the states that they know for a fact have no chance of winning over. Over all, the electoral college has no point in being apart of the voting process. The only voting process this country should yse is direct voting because it is fair to everyone. The election process should be a fair process, it should not have everyone voting and only having 538 vote count. Even when over 60 percent of the voters choose direct voting, the country still agrees to use the electoral college. All in all I have to agree with Bob Dole, Mr. Senator and abolish the electoral college!    		0
Dear Principal,  I have heard that you are considering to let students have cell phones in our school.  I have written this letter to try and convince you not to.  If students are able to text, chat, call, and play with their phones and with other people, no one would learn anything anymore.  Nearly all the students would be immersed in their cell phones, and with the cell phones available, people could search the web, go online, play games, listen to music, practically everything, right there on their cell phone.  I assure you that if you let people have their cell phones, average grades would be lower than if they didn't, as not everyone one would be paying attention to the teacher's lecture, power-point, video, etc., but instead they would be secretly texting each other and searching the web or playing games.  It is very easy to hide a cell phone while using it.  It could be in a book, or under a desk.  And yet, these are not the only issues.  Some of the students here don't have as much financially as other students.  The cell phones will arouse jealousy and lead to stealing.  If you have this rule in place, you can potentially be accounted responsible for lost or stolen phones.  If you are seriously considering this, don't let students have their cell phones at all.  They would not need to pay attention in class or learn anything, instead, they would just need some WiFi to look it up on their phone.  Don't allow students to have their cell phoned on and in use every day.  If you truly care about your students education at this school, you will listen to this, and ban all cell phone use.  So what shall it be. Do you care about your students, or not?  Sincerely,  One of your students		0
Looking at driverless cars may seem a bit odd. What is a car that you don't even really have to drive? That's not a car! Although, I am claiming to be on both sides of this situation, it may be that I would never purchase this type of car. SInce these cars have the name of driverless cars, people may not take these seriously. It does state in the article that the car does alert the driver of some things. But if you really look into it, what happens if the car glitches and doesn't alert the driver? What then? This problem may cause an accident and prohibit the driver of a bigger chance of harm.  Driverless cars may seem fun, which I have never actually been in one nor seen one, but not having to drive seems pretty relaxing, even though you hold the wheel. It may also has the downs. Let's say that somone is on their way to the hospital rushing for a loved one who is terribly hurt. How does the driverless car react? There's a whole bunch of questions, but the actual question is, is it safe for everyone to handle and drive?  All of my questions or your questions may not be answered just yet, but having one of these may be expensive. For an example, as much as gas is, or parts to your normal car are, or even the inside areas, how much will it cost to fix the sensors or even if the driverless car has gas? These things may be a lot harder to pay for since it's all practically technology. I do not recomend these types of cars to anyone simply for my opinion.    		0
As an eighth-grade student, it is important to understand how successful people accomplish their goals and how we can apply those lessons to our own lives. In this essay, we will explore the strategies and habits of successful CEOs, the importance of completing tasks in a timely and accurate manner, and how we can apply these lessons to our own academic and personal lives.  Firstly, let's look at successful CEOs and how they accomplish their goals. Many successful CEOs share a common trait: a strong work ethic and a focus on results. They are often willing to put in long hours and make difficult decisions in order to achieve their goals. Additionally, they have a clear vision for their company and are able to communicate that vision to their employees, inspiring them to work towards a common goal.  Now, let's consider what it takes to have a successful future. In order to achieve our goals, we must have a clear understanding of what we want to accomplish and a plan for how to get there. This requires setting specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. We must also be willing to take risks and learn from our mistakes in order to grow and succeed.  In addition to CEOs and personal success, we can also look at how workers in different industries plan and complete tasks. In any industry, it is important to have a clear understanding of the tasks at hand and to prioritize them in order of importance. This may involve breaking larger projects down into smaller, more manageable tasks and setting deadlines for each one.  Finally, let's consider how students complete their assignments. In order to succeed academically, students must be able to manage their time effectively and prioritize their tasks. This may involve creating a study schedule, breaking larger assignments down into smaller tasks, and seeking help when needed.  Overall, completing tasks in a timely and accurate manner is crucial to achieving our goals and having a successful future. Whether we are CEOs, students, or workers in any industry, we must be willing to put in the work and make difficult decisions in order to achieve our goals. By following the strategies and habits of successful people, we can learn how to plan and complete tasks effectively and ultimately achieve success in all areas of our lives.		1
What is a summer project? A summer project is self explanatory. It is a project that is made by students teachers in some schools with the purpose of making sure students continue learning throughout their summer break. When given a summer project who should be the one designing it? Would it be best for the project to be designed by the teachers, who know what is the most important material for students, or by a student, who knows what material is already known to them? Making these decisions may be something difficult to decide on. I believe that summer projects should be student and teacher-designed.  The main reason as to why I believe the projects should be both student and teacher-designed is because in the eyes of the teacher they might believe a subject is difficult and could be easily forgotten but to the students it could be the easiest subject that they have learned. The student could be stuck on a subject that the teacher found to be the easiest one out of them all. This way if both, the teacher and the student work together on designing the project it could benefit the student in the future school year. This process may take more time than it would if it was just the teacher designing it but it is more secure.  Another reason as to why it would be best for the projects to be student¬†and teacher-designed is because of the time it may take. If teachers would be doing them alone they would have to be looking back and forth on what each individual student needs to improve in. On the other case if students help out it would be less time they spend because the students will be explaining to the teacher what they do not understand or the subjects that¬†they struggle in.  If the students were to design their projects on their own there is high chance that they would choose the subjects that they understand. Most students would take advantage of their opportunity on to get an easy A on the project. Let's be honest how many students do you think would willingly be working on a project for school over the summer rather than hanging¬†out with friends or being on their phones. Students don't want to be spending the only real time they have out of school just to be working on school work, they will attempt to make it easy on themselves.  In conclusion the best option for designing school projects is the teachers and their students. In a way students wouldn't be able to copy off of each other¬†because not everyone struggles in the same subjects.		0
In the following ideas and information passage set we see the effects of using cars too much and how limiting our car use can have a huge impact on, not only our environment, but also on cities on people. Limiting our car usage isn't only a thing that the United States has to work on, but we see that Central America and Europe also has to work on it. Limiting our car usage isn't a small issue, but more of a global issue. Over the years we have seen the effects of global warming something cause by fossil fuels, which is gas coming from our cars and how they have had an enormous impact on our world. So, why is liming our car usage even remotely important to us?  In the second article "Paris bans driving due to smog", paragraph 10, the first thing it says is "After days of nearrecord pollution..", well, what does this say about how we're living today? Paris so close to to being on record breaking pollution, not that it's anything to be proud of. But, if that's how much pollution Paris has, which is a famous city for not only being the "City of Love", but for also being big, how will every other city's pollution be? Cities have been growing and expanding so much recently, factories are being built and more cars are being sold, how will this help limiting our car usage? If cities keep expanding, we'll just be adding to the pollution that already exists. After a couple decades all the issues we seem to be ignoring will come up and if the problems are bad now, how bad will they be in the future? This isn't just something we can ignore!  Like David Goldberg says in paragraph seven in "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car..". Why have we been focusing more on a car than on health and medicine and cures for some illnesses? Why is a car so important? Yes it makes going to places much more easier and quicker, but at what cost will we go to to make things easier on us? It isn't jsut about the pollution caused from our cr usage, but it's also about our health. There are fewer and fewer parks by the year because we'd rather have all our tax money go towards roads instead parks. More malls are opening up and more fast food places are opening up on big interstates and highways, and now all we really have to being close to nature is when we pass by the trees near the interstates and highways. We need trees in order to have oxygen, but if all this pollution is slowly killing trees, how much more time do we have left before we realize it's too late to try saving our trees and limiting our car usage? Back then no one really worried much about limiting our car usage and pollution, because it wasn't that bad. Now all you ever really hear is about pollution and how to stop it.  Even though we really have got to start limiting our car usage, there is still hope in lowering and or even stopping pollution. We could start off small, for instance, by having a day where no one is allowed to drive their cars to places or be fined if you do drive, like Bogota, Colombia does in "Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota". It must've had a positive effect because it encouraged Cali and Valledupar, two other Colombian cities, to participate in the event as well.		0
This Face on Mars is not created by alien, it's just natural landform. If it's created by alien where are the alien? We have no prove, but i believe that this Face is just natural landform. We took a picture 3 times still there is no prove that alien created this Face. Do you even believe that there are alien out in the planet? Maybe but some people does, there might be an alien, but there is no way they are going to created that Face on Mars. If there is an aliens they wouldn't leave trace like that on Mars. We have been seeing this face form 1976 to 2001 still there is no prove. All we know is there is a Face on Mars. We doesn't know who created this face or where is came up form. Its just natural landform. NASA has been looking for it and take a lot of picture but there is not prove of who or what created. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute macimum resolution. 2001n image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. We look that close its there prove ? No! If you think this Face on Mars is created by aliens why did you stop looking information about it? There is no prove of an aliens created this Face. So its just natural landform, it created it self.		0
During summer break, many students are busy on vacation or are preoccupied with other activities. Because of this, students are not reinforcing what they have previously learned or preparing for the upcoming school year. Summer projects are an efficient way to get students familiar with and exposed to concepts they will learn in school and bolster their knowledge. However, the decision of making summer projects either teacher-designed or student-designed creates a debate of the effectiveness of both types of projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed as teachers are more knowledgeable with the curriculum which will allow them to prepare an assignment that is more effective for the student, teacher-assigned projects will provide a guide for what the students will or should learn, and students will most likely feel more prepared for school with an assignment created by the teacher.  Since teachers know more about the subject they teach more than the students, having teachers create their own assignment for their students will be more effective. They know what the students need to learn based on the curriculum, so it is ideal for them to decide what they should study over the break. Students will get more out of the assignment if the teacher prepares an assignment that relates directly to what they will learn in class when school begins. It will also strengthen their knowledge and possibly reinforce what they had learned before.  Teacher-designed projects will be a guide for students during their summer break to study useful information for their classes. Teachers can design projects that is relevant to the curriculum of the class and plan out what is necessary and useful to know versus what is not. In addition, teachers usually expose basic ideas and important concepts that will help students to make connections to what they learned through the summer assignment. These teacher-designed also provides some insight for the student on what to expect in the courses that they take.  Having teachers make their own summer projects will expose the material that students need to know when they go back to school. It will help students to feel more comfortable coming to class and ready to begin learning. Through these projects, students have studied and have a better understanding of the curriculum of the class as the teacher directed the students on content they need to know. These projects also help students to gradually feel familiar with concepts they learn in the beginning of the school year rather than jumping straight ahead to learning something new.  Not only do teacher-designed projects enforce learning and help students to get more comfortable with the content of the class, but they also prepare students before the upcoming school year begins. It is ideal for teachers to design such projects as they know most about the curriculum of the class, and it allows them to prepare a useful tool for students to study to get familiar with concepts and important ideas of the class. These projects are a small exposure of what students are expected or need to know and will help them to be more successful when they begin learning in their classes.   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
To create a character of your own design, the first step is to determine the role that you want this character to have. Do you want them to be a hero or a villain, a bystander, or a leader? Once you have established their role, you can then begin to define the character's motivations and personality traits. It is important to become confident in the decisions that you make and try to plan for future decisions when it comes to your character.   Furthermore, you should also think of ways to reach the goals that you set for your character. What steps do you need to take in order to get there? Consider how your character's choices will be perceived by others and how this could affect the success of reaching their goals. Doing research into the challenges they may face and how to become the person you envisioned can help you create a realistic character with achievable goals.  After carefully considering all these aspects, you can begin to draft your vision for the character.		1
Dear principle,  In my opinion I am for the principles new policy for students to have at least a grade B average to participate in school activities. This school policy will then encourage more kids with averages less than B to do better. Students will then study more, get good grades, and not fool around during class time. If the students in the school look good then the school itself will look good.  When students hear about this new rule that will then change the way the act in school. If They want to participate in school activities they will change. Then instead of fooling around during class they will, then pay attention in class, ask questions, and take notes. If they take notes then when it comes to taking test's and quizzes they will pass the test or quiz.  The students will study more. Kids obviously don't study for tests. They know even if they get an F on the test they will still be able to participate in school activities. Now if the new policy takes place, and they get an F on the test they wont be able to participate in any sports or school activities. So students will then know to study more.  If students who get B' s and A' s on tests they are the ones who are good in class and don't need help. Those who get lower then B' s really need help. So while the students who have good averages are playing and having fun the other students will be learning. The teacher will understand why they have been getting low grades, and teach them at their level. Eventually they will understand and will be getting high marks.  I am for the principles new policy of having at least a B average to participate in sports or school activities. This new rule will encourage students to be more productive in class, and to study more. However if the new policy did not happen then everything will be the same. Students will be continuing to fail, not paying attention in class, and just not being productive enough. If the students in the school do not look good then the school will not look good, but if the students do look good then the school will look good. More and more students will come to this school, and they will be getting good grades.      		0
[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State ZIP Code] [Date]  [Principal's Name] [School Name] [School Address] [City, State ZIP Code]  Dear [Principal's Name],  I am writing to express my opinion on the issue of mandatory community service for all students. I believe that community service is an essential part of our education, and it should be a requirement for all students.  Community service provides an opportunity for students to give back to the community and make a positive impact on the lives of others. It also helps students develop important skills such as leadership, teamwork, and communication. For example, some of my friends who tutor elementary school children have developed excellent communication skills, while others who clean up litter have learned the importance of teamwork and leadership.  Furthermore, community service can help students broaden their horizons and gain a better understanding of the world around them. It exposes them to different cultures, lifestyles, and challenges, which can help them become more empathetic and compassionate individuals.  On the other hand, some of my friends argue that community service takes too much time away from their personal interests and activities. However, I believe that community service can be integrated into students' schedules without causing significant disruption. For instance, community service can be done during weekends or school holidays, and students can choose a project that aligns with their interests and skills.  In conclusion, I strongly support the idea of mandatory community service for all students. It is a valuable opportunity for students to develop important skills, make a positive impact on the community, and gain a better understanding of the world around them.  Thank you for considering my opinion.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
  Limiting car usage is essential for creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly society. While some argue that reducing car usage will negatively impact the economy and individuals' quality of life, the evidence suggests otherwise. By examining the benefits of car-free cities, the impact of reduced driving on air quality, and the shift towards more sustainable transportation options, it is clear that limiting car usage is crucial for creating a better future.  Car-free cities, such as Vauban in Germany and Paris, which enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog, demonstrate the significant environmental benefits of reducing car usage. These cities have seen a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and a more pleasant living environment. According to the passage, "limiting car usage is key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes" (Rosenthal). Reducing emissions is crucial for mitigating the effects of climate change, and limiting car usage is a significant step towards achieving this goal.  Moreover, reducing driving has a positive impact on air quality. The passage notes that "cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions" in Paris, leading to poor air quality (Duffer). By reducing car usage, cities can improve air quality and create a healthier environment for their citizens.  In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also boost the economy. As Rosenthal notes, "New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation" (Rosenthal). By investing in alternative transportation options, cities can create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth.  Finally, shifting towards more sustainable transportation options		1
Eight years ago, I had an idea to start a business. I was eager and passionate, but without any experience in running a business I made a lot of mistakes. Like many entrepreneurs, my business failed. It was a difficult experience, but I soon realized that every mistake provided me with an invaluable lesson.   I started to understand why I had failed and where I had gone wrong. Most importantly, I learned the importance of approaching a business from different angles, and of being flexible and willing to modify your plan when something goes wrong. I also gained an understanding of how innovation, creativity and dynamism could help me to run my business better next time.  My story is just one example of how failure can be a contributing factor to success. I have seen many of my family members and friends also go through periods of failure before achieving success. For instance, my cousin wanted to become a professional basketball player, but after a few years of training and practice, he failed to make it to the professional level. However, after a few years of hard work he succeeded in becoming a successful coach, using the same skills and knowledge he had acquired in his failed attempt to become a player.  In conclusion, failure is not something to be feared. With careful analysis and reflection, understanding why one fails can be the first step to achieving success by avoiding the same mistakes in the future.		1
 Dear Senator,   I am writing to you today to express my support for keeping the current Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States, rather than changing to a popular vote system. While the popular vote seems appealing in that it awards the presidency to whomever receives the most individual votes nationwide, there are some significant downsides to this approach that give me pause.  One concern about moving to a national popular vote is that it could discourage voter turnout and participation in certain states. Currently, candidates must build broad coalitions and try to win a majority of electoral votes across many states. This encourages higher voter turnout and more campaign visits and advertising spending in a variety of places. However, with a pure popular vote, candidates may be able to win the presidency by focusing all of their efforts on winning by large margins in only the most populous states. Smaller states and rural areas could feel ignored.   Another issue is that the current system helps maintain the federal character of our government. The Electoral College system requires candidates to have geographically diverse support rather than just support concentrated in large population centers. This preserves the role of individual states and encourages candidates to build cross-regional coalitions. A move to a national popular vote could weaken this state-based federal system and potentially lead over time to fewer distinct regional voices in national politics.  While the counterargument is made that the popular vote more directly reflects the will of the people nationwide, I believe our current system serves the useful purpose of moderating extremes and encouraging collaborative governance involving diverse constituencies. Overall, the Electoral College has served our country reasonably well for many years without significant problems, and I do not see a compelling reason to abandon it at this time. For these reasons, I ask that you oppose any efforts to eliminate the Electoral College in favor of a national popular vote system for electing the President. Thank you for your consideration.   Sincerely, [Your name]		1
Dear Principal,  I think it is very important to do community service. Even though some people do not enjoy it, I think students should be required to perform at least two tasks of community service.  A few reasons why I think community service is important is your giving back to others. For example, volunteering at a Soup Kitchen. Helping the people that need things more than you do.  You may already be doing community service and you don't even know it, that's how many options you have to do something. Things as simple as picking up a bag or a can you see laying in the street are considered community service. You helping the community by picking up trash. Even holding the door for people, just to be nice. That is community service.  Some of my friends already do community service anyways, and if they do, then other students must too. They volunteer at places like elementary schools to tutor the children, there and others clean up the litter outside of the building.  So, I do think students should have to perform community service. At least two tasks. Because, it is a way to help the community, and help people, and even help the environment. Community service ranges from things as big as volunteering most of your day to an organization, or just picking up garbage outside.  Sincerely,  Your Student		0
Studying Venus Remains Valuable Despite Significant Challenges  The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" makes a compelling case that continuing to study Venus is worthwhile, even given the planet's inhospitable conditions. While Venus presents extreme dangers to exploration, the scientific rewards of investigating our closest planetary neighbor justify facing these risks.   Several key pieces of evidence from the article support this view. First, Venus remains relatively unexplored compared to other planets in our solar system. Due to the planet's thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead, only a handful of spacecraft have successfully visited Venus' surface. However, this limited exploration means Venus still holds many secrets waiting to be uncovered. Gaining a deeper understanding of Venus' makeup and evolution could provide insight into Earth's own history and climate.   Second, new Venus exploration missions planned by NASA and the European Space Agency aim to directly address the challenges of Venus' harsh environment. For instance, proposed capsules designed to float high in the atmosphere would allow for extended observation while avoiding the heat and pressure at the surface. Technological advancements in heat-resistant materials and miniaturization of instruments have also increased the feasibility of robust planetary science from Venus. If successful, these planned missions could finally crack Venus' mysteries after decades of sparse study.  While exploring Venus certainly entails risks, the potential scientific rewards justify facing them according to the article. Unlocking Venus' secrets through further investigation helps achieve an important goal of planetary science‚Äîunderstanding the evolution of terrestrial planets like our own. With careful planning and innovative solutions to Venus' extremes, studying this world remains a worthy pursuit that should continue. For these reasons, the author makes a convincing case that Venus exploration merits continued support and resources despite its difficulties.		1
Seeking multiple opinions when making an important choice or decision can help someone make a better, well-informed choice for a few key reasons:  Firstly, getting perspectives from different people allows you to gather more information about your options. No single person will be able to provide every angle or consider every possible factor like a group of individuals can together. Each person you ask is likely to have had different experiences than the next, so their input and advice will not be identical. More information means seeing your choice from more sides so you can make a smarter, more thoroughly weighed decision.   Secondly, other people may notice things you cannot see yourself since you have personal involvement in the situation. When you're close to a choice, it can be hard to look at it objectively. But other individuals, even if they don't know all the details of your circumstances, can more easily spot potential weaknesses, issues, or upside you may have overlooked on your own. The added objectiveness of outside opinions helps give you a more full picture to base your choice on.  Finally, if more than one person recommends a similar course of action, their consensus validation gives you added confidence that you've identified the best path. Of course, not everyone has to agree. But if multiple individuals you respect come to similar conclusions independently of each other about what would be best for you, that alignment of perspective makes the choice they point you toward more clearly the smart selection compared to options that did not get validated as strongly by others's advice. The collective endorsement of multiple viewpoints strengthens your conviction in your decision.   In summary, seeking advice from numerous trusted individuals enables a choice to be informed from a variety of angles, vetted for any flaws unseen from your personal viewpoint, and guided toward clear options supported by consensus agreement rather than just a single person's perspective alone. For any important decision, considering input from more than one adviser maximizes possibilities to make the best, most thoroughly justified choice.		1
Countless students follow the same after-school routine. After a long day at school, they joyfully return home with a smile on their face. That happiness is because while they were forced to learn and work at school, there are no expectations like that at home. As the sun rises and sets, they have the freedom to mindlessly waste the rest of the day away. That's why rather than spending time outdoors, focusing on hobbies, or spending time with friends and family, students just lock themselves into their rooms. Then, they proceed to pull out their electronics and play away until the end of the day. It's an extremely unhealthy yet addictive lifestyle. But, that lifestyle could change if students had an after-school activity to attend. They would start spending more attention to what's outside of the virtual world. Thus, it is my firm belief that every student should be required to participate in an least one extracurricular activity because it will increase student productivity, improve students' social skills, and promote student engagement.  If an extracurricular activity became a requirement, students would have a more beneficial activity to attend after-school. Every day, when school comes to an end, many students find themselves with hours and hours of free time. However, they end up accomplishing nothing because they have no tasks to complete and no activities to participate in. So, they turn to their main source of entertainment- electronics. And while students are fortunate enough to have the entire day to spend on their phones and computers, no good comes out of it. That's why extracurricular activities are necessary. Students may resent it at first, but in the long run it will create significant improvements to their lifestyle. Students could spend their free time¬†on activities more worthwhile. They could be winning a soccer championship or fund raising¬†for those in need. The entire world is there for students to explore and discover. All students need is a small push in the right direction.  Furthermore, extracurricular activities also give students opportunities to interact with their peers. It can be intimidating for students when they have to join a group of complete strangers. However, although it is nerve-wracking, students have the wonderful opportunity to make new friends. Their team will contain people of a similar age group and perhaps similar interests. Besides, with how frequent meetings are, members will be spending an abundance of time together; they're guaranteed to form new friendships. On the contrary, extracurricular activities also help maintain current friendships. It can be difficult to meet up with friends out of school, so joining an extracurricular activity allows students to get together more often. All in all, as it goes with any team, members form a tight bond with one another. By the end of the year, they'll be surprised by the amount of new friends they've made.  Lastly, extracurricular activities promote students' engagement with their community. Students rarely ever have an opportunity to venture beyond their small school environment, which consequently limits the amount of change they're able to make. However, with extracurricular activities, students will have more opportunities to make an impact on their community. For example, being a part of the student council gives you many opportunities to make a difference. Members raise awareness of issues, fund raise¬†for the needy, and even more. Being active in a team like that motivates students. With all they accomplish, they being to feel much more productive and hence acquire a sense of belonging. That results in students truly believing they can make a difference in the world, which then causes them to become more engaged and active in their community.  It's common knowledge that extracurricular activities are extremely beneficial, yet many students still hesitate from participating and consequently miss out on amazing opportunities. Extracurricular activities have a much larger role than just providing entertainment. They allow students to become more productive, social, and active in their community. We can't allow students to miss out on a chance to build those skills. The experiences they obtain from the extracurricular activities will stick with them for life. Therefore, if participating becomes a requirement, our world will become a much better place. Students may have their doubts about extracurricular activities, but they will truly be tremendously changed by them. The requirement of extracurricular activities will allow our world to raise much healthier and productive generations. With just a simple requirement, the future of our society will look much brighter.¬†   ¬†		0
Dear Principal,  I am currently an eight grade student attending your school.  Some of my friends and I are currently working community services hours and enjoy doing them.  Many other schools require an amount of service hours to graduate.  I think that community service hours should be a required thing in order to graduate.  Some of my friends agree with this, but many of them don't.  The argument is that we, as teenagers, should be required to do service hours to graduate.  Many teens do not agree with this because they say they have busy schedules and do not have enough time to work service hours and want more time to hang out with friends.  Well, I do not agree with this.  I think that service hours are very important because it teaches teens to be more responsible and helps them find out where their interest are in life and what they enjoy doing.  This will also help them pick out high school electives.  Also, it is very important that teens help around the community, because it helps them grew more responsible and mature.  Community service can put teens in positions were they have to talk to adults to find out what they have to do, if they are doing it right, and if it is being done well.  This will help teens take constructive criticism from a boss, which will prepare them for a job.  The other argument is not having enough time for friends because they play sports or involved in other activities.  Well, if they are on a sports team then they are hanging out with their friends while at practices and games.  Also, you can do service hours with your friends.  They can plan a time when they all have a free night and do service hours in order to finish them for school.  After they are done with them they can then hang out.  Services hours are can be very fun if you are doing them with your friends.  If they do them with friends then they have the chance to hang out and help out the community.  I strongly think that our school should have a required amount of service hours that they have to finish before graduating.  I believe that service hours help prepare you for the future and find where your interest are and what you enjoy doing.  You are also helping your community by having your students do service hours.  The students can do them with friends and they can have fun while doing them.  This will also help the community grew and make your students more responsible and mature.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME      		0
In some areas in Germany, mainly the suburb areas, people don't use cars as often as most people usually do. Car usage is a pretty big problem theese days. Cars¬† mainly cause pollution, and smog but it also causes some places to ban driving partially. We can potentially stop theese problems if we start to live like some parts of Germany; We can live as a car-free city.  The Earth's pollution is mainly caused by cars. Although we probably will not make a law to ban cars completely in the U.S we can potentially start to live like Vauban, Germany. In Vauban, Germany the residents of this community are suburban pioneers. Living on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss border, Vauban's streets are completely "car free." Vauban has only one place to park-large garages at the edge of development, where a car owner can buy a space for about $40,000, along with a home. In result to this 70 percent do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. Vauban completed having no cars in 2006 has grown a trend in Europe, the United States and others to take a step back from auto usage. This movement was called the "smart movement."  Furthermore the cons from using cars so often is mainly pollution and smog. Due to near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. In result to this prohibition nearly 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. Traffic was down 60 percent in the capital of France. After five days of intensifying smog it trailed toward Beijing, China, wich is known as one of the most pollutted cities inthe world. Diesel fuel was to blame for this. France has a tax policy that favor diesel¬† over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent of the average diesel engines n the rest of Western Europe. Sure enough the smog cleared fast enough for the French party to rescind the ban of partial driving.  To add on President Obama's abitious goal to curb the U.S greenhouse gas emissions will recieve assist from an incipient shift in American behavior. U.S, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had been one of the world's prime car cultures. After decades of being in love with cars America's love affair with vehicles seems to be going down. If this continues, many sociologists believe it will, it will have a beneeficial implication towards carbon emissions and the environment. Since this happened there has been a large drop in percentage of 16 to 39 years olds from getting a license, while elders are likely to retain their license as they age. Such projections have important business implications, even if car buyers are mainly older or buying less cars¬† in one's lifespan rather than rejecting car culture outright.  In conclusion Car usage has made an impact all across the globe. If we really take this to heart then we can potentially live in a car free city. Limiting car usage is a great way to prevent pollution and smog and also makes our the air more pure rather than breathing in polluted air.    		0
Dear Principal,  Well, since the school principal is deciding whether or not to raise the grade average for sports is actually good. Although many students have a grade C average, I would say that if they were to put as much effort as they do in their sports, YES, it would be a good decision.  That is if the students that are on the sports team want to be on the team that bad.  Despite all the anger that may rage through all of the student body, i have met people who do sports and maintain a straight A average.  So in saying, it is never all that hard to maintain a higher grade average, as long as you have the time, to do both, the time management, and mainly, the skills to do any of it.  As long as you have all of those things, then you don't have to worry about much.  I'm stating that, if students currently have a grade C average, then they should be able to put that extra work into it for their own benefit, not the benefit of the school.  Realizing all that could be done with such a step-forward, if this were to go to let's say, all public schools, then there would be students that would walk that extra mile.  If students would decide they really want something, just think on how much the national report card would rise.  Everything involving school would be effected -- in a good way.  Despite all of the controversy that may rise throughout the student body, it's for their own benefit, and for the nation's benefit as well.  So my answer is, YES, this would be a good idea. Though i would suggest the schools rise the average slowly, such as C-->C+-->B.  In that type of way, so the students would be able to accept what is happening more clearly.  This would be a huge benefit in almost everything, ranging from the stock market to the nation.  This would also call for more responsibility, and overall, more genius flowing through the veins of this nation.		0
 Man! Oh man, oh like totally man, this article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" is totally radical, man! It's about how computers are able to identify human emotions using this totally new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. Think about it, like computers reading our emotions! That is so cool!  I don't know about you, but in my opinion this technology could be useful in a classroom setting. For example, teachers could use it to better understand how students are feeling and possibly even adjust their teaching methods based on the emotions they see. Like if they notice that a lot of students seem frustrated or confused, they could take a break and re-group, or maybe even try a different approach to the material.   On the other hand, some people might argue that this technology is an invasion of privacy and that students should have the right to keep their emotions to themselves. But if used responsibly and with consent, I think the benefits could outweigh the risks. And anyway, who doesn't want to help make learning more fun and engaging!  So, like, what do you think? Do you think this technology is worth using in the classroom? I'm really interested to hear what you think, dude!		1
In today's digital age, students are faced with the choice of attending school in person or online. While both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, attending school in person has several benefits that cannot be replicated by online learning.  One of the most significant benefits of attending school in person is the opportunity to build relationships with peers and teachers. In-person interactions allow students to connect with others on a deeper level, which can lead to lifelong friendships and mentorship opportunities. Furthermore, teachers can provide personalized guidance and support to students, which can help them succeed academically and emotionally.  Another advantage of attending school in person is the ability to understand complex topics more deeply. In-person classes allow students to ask questions and receive immediate feedback from their teachers, which can help them clarify their understanding of the material. Additionally, hands-on activities and experiments that are not possible online can help students gain a deeper understanding of complex concepts.  Finally, attending school in person provides students with valuable life experiences. From participating in extracurricular activities to attending school events, in-person schooling allows students to develop important social and interpersonal skills that will benefit them throughout their lives.  On the other hand, online learning has several advantages that cannot be ignored. One of the most significant advantages of online learning is the ability to access resources from anywhere. With online learning, students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, which can save them time and money on commuting and other expenses. Additionally, online learning allows students to access a wider range of resources, including videos, articles, and interactive simulations, which can enhance their learning experience.  Another advantage of online learning is the ability to gain insights from multiple perspectives. Online learning platforms often allow students to connect with classmates and instructors from different parts of the world, which can provide them with new perspectives on the material. This exposure to diverse viewpoints can help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are essential in today's globalized world.  However, online learning also has several challenges that cannot be ignored. One of the most significant challenges of online learning is the difficulty in connecting with classmates and instructors. Without the face-to-face interactions that come with in-person learning, students may struggle to build relationships and seek support when needed. Additionally, online learning often lacks hands-on		1
To maintain driving and caring for a car takes a lot of money and a lot of time. According to Source 1, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, says, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way". Having a means of your own personal transportation does not mean happiness. Yes many teenagers will say that having a car and being able to drive is their freedom but driving is not a necessity and the positives that come from limiting car usage are much greater than having the need for a car.  One negative of driving is greenhouse gases. To simply reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that someone's car tailpipe produce, reduce the amount of driving in that area. Elisabeth Rosenthal, in Source 1, states that "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe" so if a city were to offer alternative transportation, like public buses or bicycles, that percentage would drastically reduce.  There are certain conditions in which many people purposefully do not go out and drive because it is so dangerous. According to Robert Duffer, in Paris, "Congestion was down 60 percent..., after fivedays of intensifying smog". If smog can keep people off of the roads and decreases the amount of congestion in that city, imagine what people choosing not to drive could do. That could most likely decrease that amount of congestion even more.  With less people on the road, the roadways would become clearer or less crowded. To ensure that less people would be driving, an alternative transportation system would have to be given. Driving costs lots of money so what do people love more than money? To get things for free. Everyone likes money but no one enjoys spending any. Robert Duffer states, "Public transit was free of charge form Friday to Monday". Even though the transportation was free for only four days, four days of not driving your personal car would still greatly decrease the amount of air pollution and money spent out of your pocket.  Another major problem with everyone using their own cars would be the amount of traffic. With fewer cars there would ultimately be fewer traffic. According to Andrew Selsky, in Bogota, Colombia "...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day, leaving the streets of the capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams". Less traffic jams means that people would reach their destinations quicker. If there were no traffic jams then people would not only reach their destinations quicker but they would reach them extremely quicker. Andrew Selsky later states that hiking, biking, skating, or taking a bus are also all "good opportunities to take away stress and lower air pollution".  With less people using cars and roadways to commute, Andrew Selsky writes in Source 3 that "Parks and sports centers also haved bloomed throught a city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping dristics have cropped up". As this explains, less cars being used means less money being used and less roadways so there is an abundance of money and space to build new recreational buildings for shopping, eating, playing, and just having fun.  According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in Source 4, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, proposed partnering to "create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resourced, lower emissions and improve safety'". This statement from Bill Ford pretty much explains the whole idea of limiting car usage to be one of the best things for this world righ now. So many people commute by car and if just maybe once or twice a week absolutely nobody were to use a car, we would be able to reduce greenhouse gases, conserve our natural resource, save time by no traffic jams, and so many more.		0
Cars one of the world's basic means for transportation from places such as Chicago to Shanghai. Have you ever heard of a place where they bearly use cars. Due to that fact people in different areas dont even use cars such as the suburbs ranging from New York to Vauban. As a result of driving the famous greenhouse gases is coming from emissions from everyone's car not even knowing that you might be the cause of the greenhouse gases ranging from 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in the United States in more car filled areas. Creating a natural disaster just by taking a drive to the store or taking a mid-night drive with your girl. All avoidable by just minimize the use of personal transportation.  Even though driving is not seen as a bad thing it has caused many complications in the past such as Paris's smog. Smog deadly to breathe was Paris's problem since everyone was driving a vehicle at the time. Due to the massive amount of people using cars smog became a daily routine producing 147 micrograms per week. As a result to this unforseen complication many decided to ban the use of cars until the smog was lifted or completely gone. Since people don't listen many still continued to drive their cars making about 4,000 people getting fined 22-euro which is about $31 in U.S money. Giving blame to diesel fuel since that is the main source of fuel in France many turned their heads to the emissions that diesel fuel has created mainly since 67 percent of the residents in France use compared to 53.3 in Western Europe, according to Reuters. Usually Paris has more smog than any other European capitals since the streets are filled with people driving. As many days gone by reducing the smog many were allowed to drive resigning the ban starting on Monday continuing on Tuesday.  How would you feel if you was not allowed to use your car for a full day? The people of Bogota feel it as an ordinary day just without vehicles. It had been the third straight year since cars had been banned with the execption of buses and taxies. It was used to promote alternative transportation and to reduce smog in the city. If violated the person would recieve an amount of 25 U.S dollars. Even though dark grey cloubs usually gave rain showers to the people of Bogota people remained casual and continued their natural lives. Parks gyms and things like it flourished with people so did new restaurants and upscale malls.  Will it be the end of the car culture? Will people stop using cars altogether? Is it possible that in the future we wont be using cars anymore for any reason? If so life without cars I think would be better just by reducing greenhouse gases and smog to a minimum.    		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. As you know, the Electoral College is a system in which each state is allocated a number of electors equal to the number of seats it has in the House of Representatives plus its two senators. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district.  The Electoral College was created at the 1787 Constitutional Convention as a compromise between those who wanted the President to be elected by Congress and those who wanted the President to be elected by a popular vote of the people. The Founding Fathers believed that the Electoral College would be a way to ensure that all parts of the country had a voice in the election of the President. However, the Electoral College has become increasingly undemocratic over time, as it has led to several Presidents being elected even though they did not win the popular vote.  In the 2000 election, for example, George W. Bush won the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote to Al Gore by more than 500,000 votes. In the 2016 election, Donald Trump won the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by more than 3 million votes. These two elections have shown that the Electoral College is a system that can lead to the election of a President who does not represent the will of the people.  There are several reasons why I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. First, the Electoral College is undemocratic. As I have already mentioned, the Electoral College has led to several Presidents being elected even though they did not win the popular vote. This is a direct violation of the principle of one person, one vote.  Second, the Electoral College gives an unfair advantage to small states. Under the Electoral College system, each state has a minimum of three electoral votes, regardless of its population. This means that a voter in a small state has more power than a voter in a large state. For example, a voter in Wyoming has three times as much power as a voter in California.  Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a handful of so-called "swing states." This is because the candidates know that they can win the Electoral College by winning a majority of the electoral votes in these states, even if they lose the popular vote nationwide. This means that the needs of voters in other states are often ignored by the candidates.  For all of these reasons, I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. I urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would elect the President by popular vote. Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on society has been a topic of much debate. While some argue that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values, others believe that its influence is overstated. In my opinion, social media does have a significant impact on societal norms and values, and I will provide reasons and examples to support my position.  Firstly, social media has the power to shape our beliefs and attitudes. The information we consume on social media can influence our opinions and beliefs about various issues, including politics, social justice, and cultural norms. For example, the #MeToo movement, which began on social media, brought attention to the widespread problem of sexual harassment and assault, and sparked a global conversation about consent and power. Similarly, social media has played a significant role in shaping public opinion on political issues, such as climate change, immigration, and racial inequality.  Secondly, social media has the ability to create and reinforce social norms. Social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook often perpetuate certain standards of beauty, success, and happiness. These standards can be damaging, as they can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem among individuals who do not measure up. Additionally, social media can reinforce harmful gender stereotypes, such as the idea that women should be submissive and nurturing, while men should be assertive and dominant.  Furthermore, social media has the power to influence our behavior and interactions with others. Social media platforms often encourage us to share our personal information, including our location, interests, and relationships. This can make it easier for companies and organizations to target us with advertisements and propaganda, which can be harmful to our privacy and autonomy. Additionally, social media can create a false sense of intimacy and connection, leading people to share personal information and photos that they would not share in person.  Finally, social media has the ability to amplify marginalized voices and promote social justice. Social media platforms have been used to organize protests, raise awareness about social issues, and provide a platform for marginalized communities to share their experiences and perspectives. For example, the Black Lives Matter movement has used social media to draw attention to police brutality and systemic racism, and to organize protests and demonstrations.  In conclusion, social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. While it has the power to shape our beliefs and attitudes, create and reinforce social norms, influence our behavior and interactions, and amplify marginalized voices, it is important to recognize both the positive and negative impacts it can have. As we continue to use social media, it is crucial that we are aware of its influence and strive to use it in a way that promotes positive social change.		1
Limiting car usage would have many advantages to the community around it. But the main two advantages to limiting cars is the reduction of polution,and also the reduction of congestion in many suburbs. Many cities including Bogota,Paris,and cities surrounding those have already started to limit the usage of cars.  One big problem many scientist are beginning to find out about our world is that our ozone layer is being destroyed by polution we put in the air. A big contributor to polution is the exhaust being produced by the million of cars used everyday. Another big problem country all over the world have to worry about is smog,or a thick layer of fog that is really hard to see through. having this very dangerous factor in the road many car crash ratings have sky rocketed. One way this can be stop is to do what these few country have been doing, that is to have days through out the year where people cant use their cars at all. To help in force this day police have been giving people fines roughly around thirty dollars. In Bogota,Colombia it was the third straight year cars have been banned. after all these years of banning cars the turnout was large. despite gray clouds that poured rain all over Bogota. When the smog went away from Bogota many other cities from Colombia have joined the event of banning cars. a quote from CarFree Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota says that " Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven,pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up". To have these results to such a simple idea is incredible.  Another big problem in pretty much all country is congestion of their inner streets. When streets have major traffic alot of things change including the mood of people,and there is a higher percentage of car crashes. To fix this problem many cities did pretty much the same as before to retrict cars on certain days. A brilliant idea was presented and used in Paris. The idea was that "on Mondays motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31, The same would apply to oddnumbered plates that following day". After this brilliant event finished congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, and after five days the smog was gone.  In conclusion the advantages of limiting cars had a far greater output than input and has also solved many big problems. All we canhope for is the parcipitation of more and more countys or cities to help lives and our world.		0
 When people first encounter something or someone, they may have different impressions and attitudes towards it. These impressions can change over time as people learn more about the situation or the person. Sometimes, people don't change their attitudes because they don't care about the situation or the person, while others may be altered by their experiences.  In relationships, people can have different impressions about each other, such as jealousy or toxic behavior. These impressions can be difficult to overcome, but they are important to address in order to have a healthy relationship. For example, adolescents who have a negative impression of their boyfriend or girlfriend may be more likely to experience jealousy and toxic behavior.  In my own experience, I initially had a negative impression of myself and my abilities. When I was told that I disappointed others with my attitude, I felt very disappointed in myself and thought that I was not good at what others were good at. However, I realized that changing my attitude was possible, and I made a conscious effort to improve myself.  I believe that people can change their attitudes and impressions through hard work and dedication. By trying every day to forget the past and focus on the present, people can improve their attitudes and relationships. It's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, but with effort and determination, people can change their attitudes and become better versions of themselves.		1
Have you ever wondered what your life would be like if you did not have to drive as much. Maybe you didn't have a car at all. A small experimental suburb in Germany is tooling with the idea of a no car life style, along with many cities in the United States where a car is not a neccesity. Paris however has banned car usage all together, becuase of the amount of smog produced becuase of the automobiles. This could marke the end of car culture across many countries, exspecially the United States. There are many advantages to not owning or using a car, some of them may just cause you to get ride of your car.  A small suburb in Germany on the France and Swiss border have given up on their cars. "Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in the experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg." The streets of this small town are car free. The twon offers a tram that runs through the downtown, and a few small streets on one edge of the community. The town cannot bain cars altogether, but if you own a car the only place to store it is in large garages at the edge of the town. One space can cost $40,000, the cost of the space comes with the home. Only 70 percent of the population in Freiburg owns a car and 57 percent sold there vehicle before moving. Germany isn't the only country with this type of movement. The United States is promoting "car reduced" communities. This will cause increase demand of public transport to the suburbs surrounding big cities such as Chicago and New York.  Paris, however, is the first city to prohibit driving altogether. "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drribing ban to clear the air of the global city. Drivers where asked to leave their cars at home or risk a fine of 22 -euro ($31). Almost 4,000 drivers where fined. Diesel fuel was blamed becuase France has a tax policy which promotes diesel fuel. Almost 70% of drives have diesel vehicles. Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, but exceptions where made for hybrids and electric vehicles. The public transit was free of charge during the bane.  "President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emission, unveiled last week." American now is has fewer car sales, people driving less, and there are fewer and fewer liscences each year. Americas love of motor vehicles seems to be subsiding. People are driving about as much as they did in 1995 which is 9% lower then the peak in 2005. Some people may blame the lack of cars and driving on the reccession. On the other hand people were buying less cars two to three years befor the reccession even hit. If this pattern presists sociologist believe it will be eneficial for cabon emissions and the enviorment. This is becuase transpertation is the 2nd leading cause of carbon emission. This could have negitive effects on the automotive companies but they are already rebranding themselves as mobiltiy companies. This allows them to have a broder range of personal vehicles. Cities like New York have established a bike sharing program. This allows people access to bikes accross the city instead of taking a taxi. Many of the young people accross the country have not even bothered to get driver's liscenses. Driving decreased by 23% between years 2001 and 2009. They instead plan activites where they can walk or ride a bike.  The age of the car may be coming to an end. Communities have started promoting a car free life style. Made othe ways of transportation avaliable. The younger people in the community have quit driving all together. Wether becuase it is good for the enviorment or a choice they had to make becuase of the city they live in. Transpotation is evolving into a public affair, not a personal one. The automotive industry may take a hit but in the long run this could be beneficial for our planet. There will always be car buffs, but sooner rather then later, you may not own a car altogether.       ¬†       ¬†    		0
Car usage is decreasing all over the world quickly. Many people see that needing a car is no longer a priority to them anymore. Many communities are elminating cars in the neighborhood. And in certain areas of Germany, people are not even allowed to have cars. They sell them to live in the neighborhoods.  To begin with, limiting car usage is elminating air pollution in Bejing, and Paris and in the United States.¬† In Paris, there has been heavy air smog and if ur caught driving in the streets you get fined 22-euros ($31).¬† Thousands of people were fined according to the international news agency headquarters in London for driving there cars during the smog. Twenty seven(27) people had there cars impounded for their reacton to the fine they were given. Because of the air smog in Paris, people were not allowed to drive anywhere they had to take the public transit to¬† get to their destionation. So reducing the car use in Paris help get rid of the smog faster.  Also, another reason elminating car usage is an advantage is less traffic back-ups. In Bogota, Colombia the citizens hiked,biked,skated and/or took the public buses to work which left the street empty of traffic jams. Since the mid-1990s, the city has had "A Day without cars" campagin. Over time, the city has seen over 118 miles of bicycle paths being created and most of Latin American citites. Parks and sports centers also have grown throughout the cities. The sidewalks been replaced by smoother ones, traffic jams have had a dramatic drop and also more restraunts and upscale shopping centers were built. So after all, elminating cars is not a bad thing.  In addition to, every year in the United States more and more people been buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses as each ongoing year goes by. So the question that reaks through everyones mind,"Has America passed the peak driving?" Well, we may not know that answer for sure but what we do know is there is alot of changes going on. Now we all know this country was the birth place for the very first Model T Ford, and where Wilson Pickett immortalized "Mustang Sally."¬† We all have love affairs with cars in this country, but over the past year our love affairs have cooled down some. Statistics show that between 2001 and 2009, driving by young people decreased by 23 percent(23%). But when this generation "grows up" will the car rates start going back up because the parents have to take their children to soccer practice, school plays? This will remain an open question until that time. As of recently the number of miles driven per person has dropped nearly 9 percent(9%) below the peak and the same rate as it was in January of 1995. Part of this explaination is because people were unemployed and could not afford new cars.  According to Mimi Sheller, different things are converging. For example, she stated that the internet makes telecommunicating possible and easiar and makes peolpe feel more connected to others without driving around.  To conclude, there are a plethora of advantages of why limiting car usage is a great benefit to everyone and even the environment! The air pollution will be cut down by a major percent.    		0
Dear Principal,  Me and many of my friends, and other students are against this new policy because the grade level is to high for students who usually accept the lower average, and do well in their after school activities.  Another reason for you to change the new policy back is because it should only be if they are failing that you should not be able to play sports or do any after school activities.  Also if they are sports players who are good in school, but can only seem to get a C average it will seem unfair to them.  On the other hand not everyone can get at least a B average because not everyone will have the strength to work that hard just to do something they really like.  Also if what you are saying in the new policy is that students who usually get the B average, but they drop to a C they wouldn't be able to stay after to get help with their grades.  Plus I also think that you should give everyone a chance to do an after school activity to see if their grades go up or down, so then you can make your decision.  Many people would say that you are just doing this to torture the kids into getting better grades, and trying to make them change themselves mentally and physically. Lastly do you really want your sports teams to use math equations to see where a baseball will land, and while their doing that the coach will be yelling at them to run and catch the ball.  This is my reason for not having the new policy.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
"When you vote what do you commonly feel? Do you feel as joyful that your making a difference in the country as an elephant in its prime leading the herd? Perhaps you feel content, fairly certain that you picked the best person for the task like a donkey who's pleased to take a nap after helping his owners plow the field. Or maybe you just don't feel that your vote changed anything, still residing in the vote booth pointlessly waiting to be seen." The American people have always felt that they alone should decide who is to lead them. While this has been the case since America became a country, there are those who feel our current process of electing the people who will elect your candidate isn't a desirable system. Personally, I think the Electoral College is a acceptable method considering that it causes the candidates to interact with a greater bulk of the country, it makes voters consider there votes even more, and it prevents dilemas or tension relating towards the elections much more effectively. Although voters can never really all agree on something    		0
 The Face on Mars conspiracists argue that the face is too perfect to be natural, but they ignore the heaps of proof to the contrary. There are two ears, a mouth, and two eyes. All of these alone are not conclusive evidence, as they could be natural formations that coincidentally look like parts of a face. However, the contour of the face, the overall shape of the head, and the location of the protrusions all combine to form a distinct face-like structure. Evidence of this is seen in the article's mention of how some people initially thought the face was just two craters that looked like eyes, but upon seeing the higher-resolution image that unmasked the face, they realized that they were wrong.  The article also mentions how some people think that the boulders on the face are indicative of a mask, but they are simply instances of gravity working on the rocks, as the article explains. Another thing conspiracists argue is that the face is on a mountain, and there is a "bulge" on the mountain that is indicative of artificial construction. However, the article explains that the bulge is actually just a natural ridge, as shown in the article's picture.  Another claim made by the Face on Mars conspiracists is that NASA edited the image of the face to make it look more natural. The article addresses this claim, mentioning that the original image of the face was not tampered with, and that NASA went out of its way to show the original image, with the missing data, next to the edited image for transparency. The article also mentions that the face was not noticed until the image was enlarged, meaning that it was impossible for NASA to somehow "know" where the face would be and edit it accordingly.  The Face on Mars is a natural landform that coincidentally looks like a face. There is no evidence of any technological civilization on Mars, and the Face on Mars is not a sign of any such civilization. The heaps of evidence provided in the article conclusively disprove any claims to the contrary.		1
Dear Mr. Senator, The Electoral College is ruining everything that our fore fathers have worked for! When Americans vote, the majority believe that they are voting for the President of their choice, instead they are voting for a group of people, who will hopefully vote for the candidate they had wanted. The Electoral College is wrong for many reasons, but I'll narrow it down to two for you People are voting for electors, not the president and electors might not choose the President based off Popular vote.  First, The Electoral College is wrong because voters are voting for electors not the President. When voting there are two groups of people voting for the President the People and members of the Electoral College. Members of the Electoral College are actually choose by state legislatures, meaning that their can be a point in time where the state legislature chooses to pick a certain group of people based off of their political party. In 1960 the state legislature almost replaced the electors from the Democratic party meaning that even if most people voted for Kennedy the president at the time he would still not be elected because electors would not vote for someone who was not apart of their party. It's happen before, so who's to say that it won't happen again.  Second, electors may or may not choose the President based off Popular vote. Even though if we did base the presidential election off of popular vote people might vote based off of region, meaning that most people in the south would vote for someone like rodney, but we have to consider that not everyone in the south would vote for one person. Also it is also true that it electors rarely vote against the Popular vote, but it is possible that the majority of the 538 electors will vote against the people.  In conclusion, The Electoral College should be terminated because People are voting for electors, not the president and electors might not choose the President based off Popular vote. In 1960 the state legislature almost replaced the Electoral group, meaning that the Popular vote would'nt even matter against the Electoral College. Also the Electoral College may acknowledge the Popular vote, but still vote for a different candidate. If you do choose to help me terminate the Electoral College, I say we try to get help from the guy who actually played the "Terminator" I heard that he is part of the government system in California now so he could probably help us.		0
State Senator, The Electoral College is not a fair way to vote. Instead of voting for who you would like to win, you are voting for an electors who says they will vote for the candidate you want to win. Voting for who we want is a part of our rights! The Electoral College system is not only out dated, but there has also been a few fiasco.  This style of voting has been going on since the beginning, there are many flaws that need to be worked on. A major problem would be the electorss they are not reliable. "Can voters control whom their electorss vote for? Not always." This right here proves that the electorss don't always tell the truth. Who picks the electorss anyways? "Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves." We don't even get to select our electorss, how are we supposed to rely on strangers to vote for who we would like? Would you trust a random stranger to take care of your child? It is the same as putting the fate of our country in the hands of someone some people have never even seen! "During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all," This information should prove to you that the Electoral College is unfair.  The disaster factor should have been the end to the Electoral College. "Segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electorss with new electorss who would oppose John F. Kennedy." Is there anything left to say? These people tried to sabotage the election. What is stopping more poeple from this? Some electorss refused to vote for who they said they would. "faithless electorss have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please." In 1960 Hawaii sent two slates of electorss to Congress! Thanks goodness for Vice President Nixon who "validated only his opponent's electorss, but made sure to do so without establishing a precedent.'" Also, many people stated that they prefer the direct election, "Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now." With giving you this information, you should be able to infer that the Electoral College should be changed.  In conclusion, more people are against the Electoral College than with it. We should be able to vote for which one we prefer. Less people would have a problem with the election process and it would go a lot smoother.		0
I personally think that there should be an electoral college vote. Not only does it keep the popularity vote out of check, but it also holds a good amount of personality behind the fact that it carries over 100 years of tradition, divide that by 4 years per term of president, thats over 10 presidents that have won their electoral college votes. If they used the popularity vote? We would go insane. If the people realize what¬† they are talking about, we could go billions of dollars out of our debt hole were in..  Our spending habits these presidents we have had over the past years have lead us into doing? Im surprised were all still alive honestly. Different candidates have different ways of planning their lives in office, their daily commutes, their daily functions, what laws they are going to put into place next, the next time that they will make a public apperence, those kind of things. But when theyre talking about taking electoral college out of play because its "outdated" personally I would say throw them a box of loony toon cereal.  I dont believe in throwing out something our founding fathers came up with. Expecially now that we have so many of our constetutional rights going out of play and being laid to rest for the many¬† years that they helped serve us justice and made us actually realize our country went to war to fight for our freedom, thats basically taking away our freedom to have who we think is best in office. Everybody talks about both candidates. The¬† popularity war also wouldnt work because they talk about both of them equally as another citzen would.    		0
Car culture is a major part of American life, and for good reason. Cars are convenient, comfortable, and can get us where we need to go quickly and easily. However, there are also a number of disadvantages to car culture. One of the biggest problems is that it contributes to air pollution. Cars emit harmful pollutants into the air, which can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Another problem with car culture is that it can lead to traffic congestion. When too many people are driving on the roads, it can create delays and make it difficult to get around. This can be a major inconvenience, especially for people who rely on their cars to get to work or school. Finally, car culture can also be expensive. The cost of owning a car includes the purchase price, insurance, gas, repairs, and parking. This can add up to a significant amount of money over time.  There are a number of ways to limit car usage. One way is to choose to walk, bike, or take public transportation whenever possible. This can help to reduce air pollution and traffic congestion. Another way to limit car usage is to carpool or rideshare. This can save money and help to reduce traffic congestion. Finally, you can also choose to live in a walkable or bikeable neighborhood. This can make it easier to get around without a car.  There are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. One advantage is that it can help to improve air quality. Cars emit harmful pollutants into the air, which can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Limiting car usage can help to reduce the amount of air pollution in the air. Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can help to reduce traffic congestion. When too many people are driving on the roads, it can create delays and make it difficult to get around. Limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion and make it easier to get around. Finally, limiting car usage can also save money. The cost of owning a car includes the purchase price, insurance, gas, repairs, and parking. This can add up to a significant amount of money over time. Limiting car usage can help to save money on these expenses.  In conclusion, there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. It can help to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and save money. If you are looking for ways to reduce your impact on the environment and improve your quality of life, limiting car usage is a good place to start.		1
We should keep the elcetoral college because it was made by out founding fathers and should be kept alive. Not only that but it has been around for so long that it would be difficult getting use to the change. By keeping the electoral college we keep a non-democratic way of voting for out presidents. Betrayal dosent often happen because we put trust into the people we sent to the electoral college. By keeping the electoral college we also keep the chance of any runner winning, unlike if normal people got to have their votes count someone would always ain by a landslide. By also keeping the electoral college we make it so their is no chance of a tie. Like if a person from the electoral college were to betray his state.  If it were to happen the state would be very disappionted and would look down upon him or her. By keeping the electoral college we make it so the its difficult for one person to betray his or her¬† state. We all expect them to make the right choise for the whole state and they feel that pressure. Everyone only influences what the person is going to pick. But some people fold under pressure and do what the¬† other person wants. That can also be a good thing.  By putting people under pressure with a whole state on their back people would choose who ever their state wants. If every state thinks differntly then their would still be a chance for the other person to win even if other states voted for the other person. If one person got a lot of states to like them then the other peson wouldnt stand a chance if real people were voting and they would lose against a landslide victory. There would also be major fights and outbrakes of violence if we got rid of the electoral college. If you had a friend that voted for the person you didnt want to win and they won you would mad and argry. They would just rub it in your face and say you lost and could lead to fights or even killings. The smart desion would be to keep the electoral college.  By keeping it everyone is happy and will accept things easier. But if we were to abolish it the towns and cities would go and rampage with families borken and friendships being torn apart. And we can prevent that by just keeping the electoral college.    		0
The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," stated that meeting the challenge of exploring Venus is valuable because it will provide more knowledge of the planet, but also because humans will be curious about many dangerous things in the future. The author stated many dangers and doubts of exploring the planet, but then described solutions that may or may not work. It is contradictive that he decided to include facts and data that went against his own thoughts because he came back and listed data that went against the negative statements. The author created confusion to what he actually believes.  The author of the article described Venus as Earth's "twin." That suggests that we already know some facts about Venus such as it's density and size, which is enough to make people curious to how much about Venus we already know. He said that we know that Venus has many similar structures to Earth, such as mountains, valleys, and craters. If Venus is Earth's "twin," doesn't mean that it is extremely similar to Earth? The statement could make people curious about how close Venus really is to Earth, or it could make them wonder why we should bother risking people's safety if we already know that Venus is just like Earth. The author needed to be clearer on which way he wanted people to view that statement.  The author also brought up the dangers of visiting Venus multiple times. Then, he would proceed to follow the statement with tested and untested solutions. It was hard to tell which way he sided. According to the author, "Venusian geolegy and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes..." He later stated that NASA has a possible idea to send blimp-like vehicles to travel the surface of Venus, but that would not provide a detailed enough view of the ground. In order to get his point across to the audience, he should not have kept going agianst information.  The author went off topic throughout the article. The different information created slight confusion as to what the message he was trying to convey. The author stated that NASA is working on an approach to studying Venus that involves mechanical computers. He then said, "The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers..." It is irrelevant to the message when the mechanical computers were envisioned or the fact that it is shocking to hear that computers existed in 1940. It was hard to understand why computers were important to the article at all. The author made it difficult to focus on the message when he was stating random facts that were not important to the idea he was trying to support.  The author did not make it extremly obvious as to what he was truly trying to convey. If he would been more clear and less contradictive, then it would have been more obvious that he supports the idea that Venus is worthy of being explored. Also, it would have been easier to understand the point he was trying to put across if he would have stayed on topic throughout the article. The message of the article should be obviously supported by the author.      		0
In America, cars have been an integral part of our culture from the Model T. Ford to the Mustang cars have cemented themselves into our mindset. But currently cars are starting to cause a lot of problems to people such as: car accidents, pollution, and just leaving areas to crowdy. One of the main problems that cars globally cause is smog emission which is caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and can cause difficulty in breathing, lung cancer and rampant air pollution. However, in other parts of the world people are limiting car usage to almost banning them all out completly in certain areas in order to be more environmentally friendly and reducing air pollution. By limiting car usage in America people can benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars.  In North America, pollution has been a major problem for citizens in many ways. Besides power plants, the second main source of pollution are cars, as they release harmful chemicals and gases like smog which can cause congestion and when too much and inhaled on a daily basis, can lead to lung cancer. By limiting car usage people can benefit more to the people for example in Paris,France a partial driving ban was enforced in order to clear the air of smog after days of nearrecord pollution. By doing this congestion was brought down by 60 percent helping to majorly clear the air and make breathing better for people.  In Vauban, Germany residents of the area have been called suburban pioneers due to giving up their cars. By doing this people were able to be more happy and enjoy life more. For example, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," this aids the argument that by banning or limiting car usage people are able to be much calmer and benefit more. In Bogota, Colombia during "Carfree day" for the first time two colombian cities joined Bogota in this unique event. there more parks and sports centers for people were placed, the sidewalk were smoothe and more business and commercial areas were opened up for people. This further shows that people can benfit greatly without having cars.  Throughout the world wherever cars have been limited or banned there has always been one constant, new alternative transportation. In China in order to help reduce the absurd amount of smog and air pollution, chinese citizens resorted to using bikes leading to a drop in smog levels. By limiting cars and replacing them with alternative transportation people can be much safer from more dangerous situations, such as car acsidents hurting people, keeping dunk drivers away from the steering wheel, and being able to save more money from not buying a car. Though some alternate vehicles are not fast enoguh for example bikes, this has been remedied in some areas by allowing free public transit from buses and taxi services.  Throughout all of these benfits people can benfit more greatly but that's not enough. In 2012 during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford proposed a business plan in where partnering with the telecommunication industry to create cities where "pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation trafic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""The End of Car Culture" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Through bright ideas like the advantages of limiting cars can be fully realized and brought to life in order to help and save more people from negative aftereffects. In America if people were to cut down on car use people could benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars.		0
 We make our own character traits because we can decide if something affects us in three ways:  First, if something is not important to us, it will not impact us. For example, when someone loses a material possession and they are not attached to it, they may not feel the need to find a solution.  Second, if a problem arises in the workplace, we may feel motivated to resolve it because we want to maintain a positive and productive work environment. However, some people may be passive and not actively seek to address the issue.  Third, if we are discussing something with someone and they become upset, we may choose not to respond because we do not want to escalate the situation. On the other hand, some people may become defensive and try to fight, even if it is not productive.  However, there may be times when something affects us, such as a family issue or a matter of great importance to us. In these cases, we must actively choose our character traits to handle the situation in a healthy and effective manner.  In conclusion, we make our own character traits because we can decide if something affects us and choose how we respond to it.		1
In today's world, it is becoming more and more important to consider our identity in different situations. The concept of being ‚Äòsomebody else ?can be a useful tool in many aspects of life, such as accomplishing goals, avoiding conflicts, and even adapting to different environments.  For instance, in the political unrest between the current President Donald Trump and the Democrats, changing identities could help to increase understanding and foster relationships. We can also look at the example of American secret service agents disguising themselves as Muslims. This could be useful in diffusing dangerous situations, since they would be able to gain insights into the culture of the environment they are in and therefore be better equipped to handle and work around such conflicts.   Moreover, in everyday settings, changing identities could help us to adapt to different environments as it allows us to gain new experiences that can contribute to our personal growth or to reach our goals. For example, with the ability to become somebody else, we are able to open ourselves up to new possibilities and meet others with open minds.  As such, there are many benefits of being somebody else at times. We can use this to our advantage to reach our goals, avoid conflicts, and gain insights into different cultures and environments. It is important to consider how this practice can help us to foster relationships and potentially increase understanding.		1
A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows computers to read human emotions has recently been invented. It works by recreating the human muscular motions in the face that are characteristic of certain emotions. Although this technology that allows computers to read emotions may seem irrelevent, ultimately the technology could potentially improve the way that students learn, and help students with social problems that they may have in school.  To begin, the Facial Action Coding technology can be used to tell whether or not a student is understanding a topic. According to Dr. Huang, a professor of the Beckaman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored..." (6). This would allow the instructor to alter the way that they teach the topic to better convey the message. This can also be used when a student needs some kind of stimulation to be able to focus in class. The author Nick D'Alto also states that the "software can also identify mixed emotions" (4). This would allow the teachers to see the students who are stressed and confused and those who are happy and excited. When a student is confused or stressed, the teacher can provide additional practice or tutoring in that subject. The information that a teacher can recieve from the software in very valuable. Humans can read emotions to a certain extent, but some people are good at hiding how they really feel and this can be detrimental to their education. Dr. Huang states " most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication" (6). By enabling teachers to use the technology, they can offer assistance to a student who may not ask for it otherwise.  In addition, students can bennefit from this technology in the social environment. According to Dr. Huang "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal" (4). This means that if a student were getting bullied but they were hiding it, the teachers could find out the information quickly and help the student figure out what is going on. When a student is identified as being sad or depressed, the computer coud show funny pictures to help the student feel better. In fact, "according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them" (9). This means that by smiling, the students will actually make themselves feel better.  Overall, the use of Facial Action Coding technology is very benneficial. Whether it be from a strictly educational standpoint, or from the social envirionment side, the results are in favor of improving the school experience of students.                 		0
There are many advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing the usage of cars we can lower the air pollution in our cities. If the number of cars on the road is lower than usual, then the number of traffic jams and car crashes will be decreased. Driving is a huge responsibility and worrying about protecting your life, the passengers in your cars life, and other drivers on the road's life can be very stressful at times.¬† Lowering the usage of cars can limit that stress.  Polloution is bad and it destroys the Earth. When we drive, our tailpipes give off greenhouse emmissions that ravage the o-zone layer of our atmoshphere. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. The congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. By reducing our car usage, we can make our world a more clean and less polluted place.  Traffic jams are annoying and frustrating. Car crashes are dangers and life altering. You can avoide both of these terrible things by limiting how often you drive your car. Everytime you sit down in that drivers seat and turn the car on, there is a chance of getting stuck in traffic or into a wreck. There is no better way to avoid this than walking, taking a bus, or biking where ever you need to go. In a program that was set to spread to other countries, millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses yesterday, leaving the streets of Bogota, Colombia free of traffic jams.  Driving can put a tremendous amount of stress on a person. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. You don't have to live with all of that stress. Just limit yout car usage and you will live a happier life.  In conclusion, there are so many advantages to limiting car usage. You can lower air pollution. Driving less reduces the chances of you getting in a traffic jam or worse, a car accident. Last but most certainly not least, driving less reduces stress.       ¬†       ¬†¬†    		0
I believe that students should not have the privilege to use cell phones at school because if the students were able to have there cell phones at free periods they would become to much of a distraction for the students to be able to concentrate, and they would just have that urge to check there phone or they would even check there cell phone for that matter. And that is not fair to the student because he or she should have an equal amount of education. It also wouldn't be fair to the students in the surrounding area or the teacher who has spent he or she's time making the lesson plans.  My second reason why  I believe students should not have cell phones out at all is because cell phones are also a way drama can very easily get started , because you can just start texting and rumors can get spread faster.  Theses are my main two reasons why I believe students shouldn't have a cell phone privilege on school grounds.  Hope theses reasons are taken into consideration		0
Brazil is a vibrant and diverse country, with plenty of unique foods, experiences, and activities to be explored. From feijoada, a national dish of black beans and pork, to the traditional a√ßa√≠ smoothie made from the Amazonian berry, cuisine lovers are sure to be delighted. For those looking for an immersive experience, consider experiencing a traditional festival or parade. The popular Carnaval is one of the most well-known parades to explore, held annually in preparation for the religious season of Lent. If you‚Äôd like to gain an even deeper understanding of the culture, learning how to say some basic phrases in Portuguese is worthwhile. A few phrases like ‚Äúbom dia ?(good morning), ‚Äúpor favor ?(please), and ‚Äúobrigado ?(thank you) will go a long way to showing your willingness to engage in the culture.		1
Dear state senator,  Changing the vote from voting for a slate of electors to popular vote would be reasonable. I think that having to vote for a slate of electors is pretty hard knowing that you're basically just voting for people that's with one president or another president. Popular vote is a good idea because you can get a bit more accuracy from the votes.  Electorial college has 34 electors who "Can be anyone not holding office" also voters can get confused about who they're voting for. "Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electorial vote." If there was a tie, it would have to be "thrown to the House Of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president." We really dont want the House Of Representatives solving a tie for us. Unlike the popular vote where there is re-counts, the electorial college has none of that. If its a tie it gets passed on to another group.  Popular votes are more ideal because you actually have a chance of the person you voted for actually becoming president. If there's a tie, re-counts are established. Popular votes also don't have "disaster factors". This also has a less chance of a dispute erupting like it did in 2000 with the electorial vote. With popular vote, you are guaranteed that you know who you're voting for and you don't have the possible chance that you've just voted for the guy you highly dislike. Popular votes had also won the election for President Barack Obama. Where if it were electorial college, it would have taken a long time for the winner of the vote is announced.    		0
There is an activity for everyone out there, it just may take some searching. Getting involved in after school activities is a great way for students to learn what they love and to excel at it. In addition the right balance of after school activities and school can reduce stress and improve time management skills. It is important for students to be involved in an extra curricular activity after school because it helps them make friend, develop new skills, and can accompany the lessons taught at school.  Participating in extra curricular activities after school can help build relationships and create friendships. By getting involved in different activities after school student have the chance to meet new people who attend different schools or get to know the people they already know better. When participating in an after school activity that a student enjoys there will already be a group of of other students a similar age, and that have common interests making it easy to start conversations and build relationships. For instants the students of the track team will always be able to discuss track practices, meets, and how much fun it is. In addition they always see each other at practices allowing them to get to know each other better. When students get involved in an activity they enjoy he or she will spend quality time participating in the extra curricular that they and a friend both enjoy instead of hanging out on there phones, which in this day and age is quite common. After students locate the activity they enjoy, they can participate in that activity through their adulthood always giving them an outlet to make new friends.  Being involved in an activity outside of schools can assist you in developing new skills. As students try different things they will be given an opportunity to learn about the many different kinds if activities that are offered. By participating in extra curricular activities it allows students to discover what they excel¬†at and what they enjoy allowing them to be able to pursue it. Even if student don't enjoy physical activities such as sports, they can still excel¬†at other clubs such as knitting, sewing, yearbook, or even video games. By simply practicing the things they enjoy students¬†will be able to develop a talent for the activities they enjoy. Participating in after school activities allow students to develop a habit of learning new skills that can aid them in schools, and their future careers.  Getting involved in after school activities is important because it is a great way to accompany the skills taught at school. Most students come home and do nothing but homework until dinner do to not making the most of the time given at school such as study periods. By participating in extra activities outside of school the student will learn how to effectively manage their time consequently making more time for the activities they enjoy. Studies have proven that getting a hour of exercise daily is good for the health, and can help lower stress levels. Even if they choose to participate in a non-athletic activity the student can still reduce stress by spending time participating in an activity they enjoy. Time and stress management are both important life skills that can be assisted by joining after school activities.  It is important for students to be involved in an extra curricular activity after school because it helps them make friends, develop new skills, and can accompany the life lessons taught at school. Extra curricular activities aid students in building long lasting friendships. Participating in after school¬†activities assist students in developing new talents and encourage them to trying new things. Getting involved in after school activities can teach students stress reduction and time management. Participating in after school activities can benefit students many ways and allows them to try new things.		0
This essay will include the reasons why people need to challenge exploring Venus. The text states that it will be good to meet the very edges of imagination and invoation to find out if Venus is really real. The author also says that people should be brave to explore on pass the earth and be more open to it.  Venus would be dangerous to explore, because of it 97% carbon dioxcide. They say that the tempperatures average above 800 degrees on Venus. The pressure is 90 times greater tha what we experience on our planet earth. NASA states that they want to send our human kind to study the planet Venus.  There will be like 30 blimp-like vehicles hovering around the planet Venus. The tempertureswill still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahernheit. NASA is working on other approches right now to explore Venus. These are some of the ways that they are going to try and learn moe about Venus and other planets.            		0
In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This movement is motivated by a number of factors, including the environmental impact of cars, the health risks of driving, and the cost of car ownership.  One of the main arguments in favor of limiting car usage is that it can help to reduce air pollution. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. They also emit other pollutants, such as particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and protect public health.  Another argument in favor of limiting car usage is that it can improve public health. Driving is a major risk factor for obesity, heart disease, and other chronic health conditions. This is because driving is a sedentary activity that does not require much physical activity. By walking, biking, or taking public transportation instead of driving, we can get more exercise and improve our overall health.  Finally, limiting car usage can save money. Cars are expensive to purchase, maintain, and insure. They also require parking, which can be a major expense in urban areas. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can save money and improve our financial security.  In conclusion, there are a number of good reasons to limit car usage. Doing so can help to improve air quality, public health, and financial security. If we all make an effort to drive less, we can create a healthier and more sustainable future for our communities.  In addition to the above, there are a number of other benefits to limiting car usage. For example, it can help to reduce traffic congestion, improve road safety, and promote social interaction. By walking, biking, or taking public transportation, we can get to where we need to go without having to worry about traffic. This can save us time and stress. Additionally, walking and biking are good forms of exercise, and taking public transportation can give us a chance to meet new people and learn about our communities.  Overall, there are many good reasons to limit car usage. If we all make an effort to drive less, we can create a healthier, safer, and more sustainable future for our communities.		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME:  Some of my friends perform community service, for example, some tutor elementary school children and others clean up litter. I do not think we should have to do this unless we wanted to. For example, there are many things that some kids might have to do at home. There could be: homework, chores, or even babysitting. This could take a while and put stress on us if we had to do community service. We have things that we need to do, and we want to do. Therefore, I do not think we should be required to do any kind of community service unless we volunteered. An example of myself not having time is: I have to wash my dogs every afternoon, I have to do many chores, and babysit my younger sister until my parents get off of work, I have to do my homework, and take a shower. Some things that I would like to do is: watch TV, listen to music, go walking, or ride bicycles. If I had to perform community service every afternoon, or even once or twice a week, I would have no time to do what I want and need to do. For example, I go to school everyday. I get out of school, and ride the bus home and get home at 3:30 P.M. every afternoon. My father doesn't get off of work until 7:00 P.M., and my mother doesn't get off until 7:30 or 8:00 P.M.I have a younger sister, that's five years old in preschool. She has to be with me at all times until my parents get off of work. I couldn't carry her with me to do community service because she's young and she gets into everything. Another example is: washing all three of my dogs every afternoon. That probably takes about an hour or an hour and a half. Homework usually takes about an hour, and taking out the garbage, washing dishes, cleaning my room, sweeping the house, watering and feeding the dog, cleaning my bunny cage, mopping and dusting usually takes probably about another two hours. I would like to be able to do all of that, and watch TV and ride bicycles or something everyday. This would take up most of my time. Please consider about thinking of all of this and realizing not all children have time to do this, and most of us don't want to do this either. Thank you.  Yours Truly,  STUDENT_NAME		0
 The Electoral College is a system used by the United States to determine the President and Vice-President of the country. It is composed of 538 electors, who are chosen by the states based on their population. While it has been in place for over two centuries, there are many debates about whether or not it is effective.   One of the reasons why the electoral college system was established was to give more weight to states with larger populations, as they would have a greater say in the election. This would ensure that the President is elected by a representative sample of the country, rather than just by cities and population centers. Additionally, it would prevent small states, where large majorities are common, from having too much influence over the outcome.   However, some argue that the current electoral college system is flawed and needs to be changed. They argue that the system is rigged against candidates who do not have a significant presence in certain states, such as California and New York. Additionally, it tends to give more power to rural voters, who may not be representative of the entire country.   There have been several efforts to reform the electoral college system, including the abolition of the electoral college altogether and the introduction of a national popular vote. While these proposals have garnered support from some, others argue that they could lead to even more extreme results and make it more difficult for certain groups to have a voice in the election.   Overall, the question of whether or not the electoral college works is a complex one. While it was introduced with good intentions, it is clear that the system has its flaws. If we are to have a fair and representative democracy, it is important to carefully consider the pros and cons of any proposed changes to the electoral college.   In conclusion, the electoral college system has its advantages and disadvantages. While it was designed to give all states an equal say in the election, small states may still have too much influence. Additionally, it can be difficult for candidates to win if they do not have a significant presence in certain states. While some have suggested abolishing the electoral college altogether or introducing a national popular vote, these proposals have their own set of problems and should be carefully considered. Ultimately, the electoral college is an important part of our democratic process, and it is important to continue to evaluate its effectiveness and make any necessary changes to ensure that it remains fair and representative.		1
A time without cars would be a very interesting idea, but now that almost everyone has a car some people think that it would be hard to seperate from them. So instead of completely sepereateing from them lets try to limit thier usage. Think of all the benifits not just for you for everyone. Most cars pollute the air we breath, things would be different because think of all the money you could save by not having to buy gas or another car, and also think of how lazy cars have made people today cities would improve if people just walked instead of driving to and from work.  We all know how unhealthy cars can be to the envirorment, but did you know it could get so bad it could really hurt people. according to Robert duffer paris had to place a ban on half of the cars because they had so much smog in thier city. "On monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine" (Robert Duffer). he also said that diesel fuel was blamed and that it is worse than the normal gasoline. once a majority of the people had stayed off the roads for a while the smog eventually cleared up. So once agian this shows how harmful cars can be to an enviroment.  The reason america is having a drop in driven miles in the past years is that with the unemployment rate high and most americans can't afford cars. the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal has showed that since 2005 the number of miles driven has decreased and that the explanation of the recesssion is because of "cash-strapped americans could not afford new cars" (Elisabeth Rosenthal). Another statistic from the passage was that "the rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three yeas before the downturn"(Elisabeth Rosenthal). Even most middle class people have working cars some struggle to pay thier car payments and with the cost of gas high too they could really have a hard time.  Many people belive that the car is one of the main reasons that people today are as lazy as they are. just think if their were no cars everyone would get exersize by walking too and from work or the store. In Bogota Columbia parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city. Just because they have something called a car free day this¬† major event has inspired new bike paths and sidewalks throughout the city. and that was only a day out of the year and most of the people gladly participated. this was the third straight year of this event but it still goes on even when the rain is coming down people still want to be apart of events without cars.  Unfortunatly most people would only see the bad side of things if anyone tried to completley get rid of cars forever. But there are always a good side of things with anything including the car. The problems of polution, the expenses of the things you need to have to keep a car running or with you, and the fact that it help stop the laziness of some countrys and help make them look new.    		0
Dear state senator,  By my own opinion i really consider of having the votes based off popularity and also facts . I belive that some of the people that do want to become president someday will not become that because their votes mainly deals with the electoral colloges and what they really when the counts of the votes should be really counted off what the people of the united states really think or who they think our president should really be. Some people think we should have a black president or a white president green,purple,or blue it really doesnt matter in my opinion i think i am speaking for everyone when i say that wewant a person that would make great descisions for the umited states a person that is welling to go above and beyond to make our countrymore better and a safe place to all . And at the end of the day people in america doesnt want or think that it is right to have a female president sitting in the seat of a president,i say simply because the people of the USA doesnt think women have enough power or orders, or authority i think women should have the same rights as men. But at the end of the day i think that the people of the united states should have a right to choose who they want to serve as or president , someone who would make change and make the USA a better and safer place for everyone. Someone whois very well educated and have a outlook or reach of things. It shouldnt be based off the electoral colleges because america might disagree with their descison and cause a whole lot of chaos.    ¬†    		0
Are you for or against driverless cars?  I am for driverless cars.  Driverless cars could decrease the amount of accidents.  Also, if you get an important phone call, you can answer and not have to worry about getting in an accident.  Driverless cars seem like a great idea to me.  It would be great to have because then drivers won't usually have to worry about crashing.  If there is an area on the road that needs to be driven by a human, the car can just give a signal to notify the driver of like road construction or if there was an accident.  If there are smart cars, there should also be smart roads.  Smart roads would most likely eliminate all chances of a crash or accident.  In conclusion, I think driverless cars will be in the very near future.  I feel like it would make driving a lot safer.  It could possibly eliminate all possibilties of a car crash or accident to occur if smart roads were built.  In the future, we all might be an owner of a driverless car.		0
"So, if you're a NASA scientist, you should be able to tell me the whole story about the Face On Mars, which obviously is evidence that there is life on Mars, and that the face was created by aliens, correct?" No, twenty five years ago, our Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Us scientists figured out that it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia, only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyption Pharaoh. Very few days later, we revealed the image for all to see, and we made sure to note that it was a huge rock formation that just resembled a human head and face, but all of it was formed by shadows. We only announced it because we thought it would be a good way to engage the public with NASA's findings, and atrract attention to Mars-- and it did.  The face on Mars soon became a pop icon; shot in movies, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. Some people thought the natural landform was evidence of life on Mars, and that us scientists wanted to hide it, but really, the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. We decided to take another shot just to make sure we weren't wrong, on April 5, 1998. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team took a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, revealing a natural landform, which meant no alien monument. "But that picture wasn't very clear at all, which could mean alien markings were hidden by haze" Well no, yes that rumor started, but to prove them wrong on April 8, 2001 we decided to take another picture, making sure it was a cloudless summer day. Malin's team captured an amazing photo using the camera's absolute maximum revolution. With this camera you can discern things in a digital image, 3 times bigger than the pixel size which means if there were any signs of life, you could easily see what they were. What the picture showed was the butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.  "But how do we know you're not just hiding things from us?" You should know NASA isn't hiding anything from the people because if there was evidence of life it would benefit us, so why hide it? If you still don't believe the evidence the pictures are out for you to see, which obviously shows a natural landform. The reason to not believe these movies and magazines is because they ignore the research. They make up things to get the people going, but what they actually should do is pay attention to us, because we have very important findings every single day. 		0
Imangine being able to know the emotions of students during class, such as when they are bored, or when they are confused. Thats what the new Facial Action Coding System would achive. This kind of technology in the classrooms would be a nessestiy for teacher to effectivy teach to thier students, and idetify when they need help, or when they are getting bored during thier lesson.  Studnets get bored during class, and dont pay attention becuase of that. Students also get confused during class, but sometimes a bored student can get confused with a student that is confused on what the teacher is taling about and needs help. The FACS would change that, becuase teacher would be able to analyze whether their students are either board or confused, or enjoying their lessons.. It would also help teacher identify which lessons thier students are enjoying, and would be able to use that data to plan which lessons to include, and which lessons or activitys to throw away becuae they are boring and would not do the theire students any good."'A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Haung predicts 'Then, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"' (D'Alto). Meaning that the FACS can help with digital lessons too, improving the effectinsy of them as well. Another asepct fo the FACS, is that it can help students learn more about identifying emotions. "To and expert, faces dont lie; theses muscles clues are somtimes used tospot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isnt't being truthful" (D'Alto). This tecnolgy can spark an interest in psycology in students making the more interested in learing about emotions and how they can idedetify them in their peers. It can also cuase students to be interested in the technology behind it all. "His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code" (D'Alto). This can also spark a interest in coding and working with computers.  Therfoe, the FACS will be a valuabel tool for eaching in the classroom, for both the teachers, and the students. people assuem tht sudents do bad in school becuase they dont pay attention, but thsi is usualy becuase the lessons are either confusing or boring.   		0
Dear Principal,  I have noticed that you are deciding to change the schools sport policy. I think that you shouldn't do that. Consider the fact that some people do better in school by participating in sports. It helps the students work as a team.  Some people to sports because their parents make them. Others do it for the love of the sport. How would you feel if some one took away something that you loved just cause your not getting a B average? I'm thinking not very happy. Also, many parents might get mad at you for doing that. It's the parents job to decide if the student should stop doing sports or not, if it's affecting their grades.  Doing sports also helps students with teamwork. In school teachers are always looking for new ways to help students work as a team. If you are doing sports or other activities you need to work as a team to win or to finish the job. So students use their skills that they learn by doing sports to how they work with others in school.  Also, if students want to get into sports but they have a C average they might be disappointed. Because they can't		0
Dear Principal,  If you played on a team wouldn't you want to have good, honest citizens?  Why would you want to play with the people who get bad grades and invariably get in trouble?  I know I wouldn't want to.  To play on a team there should have to be only the people who get good grades.  I believe that if you are on a team that you should have to have good grades and a spectacular record.  One reason why I think people should have to get good grades to be on a team is because that way you only get the dedicated students.  I say that because if they have to get a B- average you better they probably have to work hard to be on the team.  That is a good thing because then they will be dedicated to their team and their school.  Also I think it is like that in college, all the super good athletes in college have to get good grades to play.  If they don't get good grades then they can't play.  It should be like that in middle and high school.  If the athletes want to be on the team they have to get good grades.  A recent study said that if a school has this policy the school's grade point average is 24 percent higher than school without.  That is quite a significant jump up and I think it shouldn't be ignored.  Another reason I think that we should do that is because then you get good all- around citizens.  If they have to get good grades then they are dedicated to their school. Also if the athletes play then they are dedicated to their team.  When or if the school changes that policy, I think we should also add that the athletes have to have a good behavior record.  That way they have to get good grades, be an athlete, and good behavior.  Add that up and you get an all-around good person.  I believe that our school should change that policy to a B- average.  That way they have to be dedicated to their school and their team.  Other people might say that you will get a smaller turnout.  Yeah, but that is a good thing because then you		0
In retrospect, people use to be able to live a happy carefree life before cars were invented. Cars were just something people used to be able to get to places quicker, and to be able to leave when ever we wanted to. A car used to be a luxury item, and now a car is a nessecity for most humans. Some countries are helping"But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling,"Source 4 the cause. The benefits of limiting car usage are it will help the environment, it will reduce most citizens stress levels, and it will regulate money in different way.  The benefits of limiting car usage is that the environment will be a lot healthier. According to experts "Automobiles are a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes,"Source 1. The environment is very important to keep healthy. Cars are very polutefull "After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city," Source 2 towards the environment.  Also connecting to the benefits of limiting car usage helps relieve stress. According to Heirun Walter, a media trainer "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"Source 1. Without cars more Colombians "In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carefree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams,"Source 3 were more active. When you exercise it helps you to relive stress.  To most people money is very important. Now without having cars our money get regulated thru a public bus or subways. Losing revenue is not a bad thing "Delivery companies complained of lost of revenue, while expectations were made for plugin cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers,"Source 2 for everyone. Overviewing it "It was the thrid straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines,"Source 3 we could make more money off of violators.  Cars are very umbigitious in most countries. Cars are not a neccesity of life. Acccording to recent studies "Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by,"Source 4. Citzens who used their car less were saving money, less stresed out and were more evironmentaly considerate. The benefits of limiting car usage are it will help the environment, it will reduce most citizens stress levels, and it will regulate money in different way.		0
  Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can improve the quality of life in urban areas. According to the passage set, car-free cities like Vauban in Germany and Paris, France have seen a significant reduction in air pollution and smog due to the partial or full ban on driving (Rosenthal, 2009; Duffer, 2014). In addition, the reduction in car usage can lead to a more compact and walkable city design, which can encourage physical activity and reduce obesity rates (Rosenthal, 2013). Furthermore, the passage suggests that there has been a shift in American behavior, with Americans buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses (Rosenthal, 2013). This trend has implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions (Rosenthal, 2013).  However, some may argue that limiting car usage can have negative economic impacts, such as reduced productivity and job creation (Selsky, 2002). For instance, the passage notes that the car industry could be negatively affected if the trend of reducing car usage continues (Rosenthal, 2013). Nevertheless, the passage also suggests that companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as "mobility" companies with a broader product range beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal, 2013). This shift in the industry could potentially create new job opportunities in the transportation sector.  In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including improved air quality, a more compact and walkable city design, and a reduction in carbon emissions. While there may be some negative economic impacts, the shift in the industry towards mobility companies could create new job opportunities. As		1
Hey there!  So, I'm gonna write this essay about this quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson.  It's like, really deep and stuff.   So, the quote is "To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment." Like, think about it.  Everyone wants you to be something you're not. Your parents, teachers, friends, social media,  - they all have these expectations of who you should be.  It's like, why can't they just let us be ourselves?!  I mean, I know I've definitely felt that way before.  Like, my parents are always on my case about getting good grades and stuff, but I'm like, "Dude, I just wanna play video games and hang out with my friends!"  And don't even get me started on social media.  It's like, everyone's always posting these perfect pictures and statuses, and you're just like, "Ugh, why can't I be like that?"   But, you know what?  Emerson is totally right.  It's the biggest accomplishment to be true to yourself, even when everyone else is trying to change you.  Like, think about it. If you can resist the pressure to be someone else and just be yourself, that's like, super powerful.   And it's not just about grades or popularity or whatever.  It's about being happy with who you are, flaws and all.  Like, I know I'm not the most popular kid in school, but I'm okay with that.  I'd rather be myself and be happy than try to be someone else and be miserable.   So, yeah.  Emerson's quote is totally right.  It's like, the greatest accomplishment		1
With so many different activities available to enjoy outdoors, it can be hard to know where to start. Popular activities like soccer, softball, and other sports activities offer a great way to stay active and have fun with family and friends. Additionally, there are countless games and activities like tag, hide and seek, and even scavenger hunts that can be enjoyed outdoors. Beyond physical exercise, these outdoor activities are also beneficial in providing quality time between family and friends. There are so many aspects that make outdoor activities enjoyable: from the fresh air to the physical activities themselves, it can be the perfect way to spend an afternoon. Ultimately, outdoor activities have long been a valuable part of how we connect with family and friends and spend quality time together.		1
While for many years the traditional way of a class comprised of students physically being in the class to learn, now in the age of the internet students can participate in the classroom at home. People believe that students should still go to school but students gain many benefits when they attend school at home because they have more personal time, have better attendance, and make schools less crowded.  Students have been balancing school and after curricular activities¬†for a long time now, but students would have more available time if they took online classes. Students can choose classes based on their own personal schedule. This would make it easier to balance their day because they can do there classes before or after their activities. Also the classes would be flexible unlike normal school where there is a fixed time one must be at school to learn, now it can change based on a student's¬†daily tasks. If a student is late or sick one day instead of missing precious class time and material they now can catch up on later in the day with out any backlash. Online classes would help give students more free time because the class depends on how fast a kid can learn and complete the material. If a student is really gifted they can learn and finish new material very quickly, which gives them more time to focus on their own lives and not about school. Traditionally in the classroom the teachers job is to make sure that all the students learn, therefore many times a handful of students would be ready to move on and learn but the teacher cannot because there are other students who are behind. Online classes solve this by making it possible for a student to move on individually at what ever pace they need it to be. The introduction of online classes can gift a student with more time and freedom.  When a student misses school they lose a lot of valuable learning but with online classes they will achieve a better attendance record. Online school makes it possible so the classroom is where ever a student has a smart device with an internet connection. That means that whether a student is on vacation or is in a blizzard they can learn. The student will never have to miss another class because they are sick because they can even learn in their bed, this will severely cut down the attendance gap that many students have. Online schooling will decrease the rates that students skip. When a students skips school they would usually be able to make up the work the next day but with online classes they would stay at home and would have to complete their work or their grades would suffer, so this cuts down the days a student would be able to skip and not do any work. Online schooling helps coax kids into not skipping and pushes learning on the go, this drastically helps with missed time in the class room  Many schools around the country are over crowded but with online schooling taking kids out of the school majorly helps with overcrowding. When online schooling takes away kids from a school that is overcrowded it takes off the stress put on the education system there. This makes class rooms smaller and teachers more available to a smaller class but for more time. This also helps the students by making there school day more efficient. When a school gets smaller they can spread their resources more efficiently. Now not only do students at home who take online classes get benefits but also kids in schools. The school now has more money, time and availability to each individual student, which enriches their own learning. Online classes helps take away students from schools and helps with overcrowding and in the process improve the learning of others.  With the introduction of online learning, students in school or at home both receive great benefits that improve their educational experience. This happens through the process of giving students more time, keeping them in school, and relieving other schools of overcrowding.¬†		0
 Throughout history, the electoral college has been a contentious topic in debate among Americans, with questions continually asked about its effectiveness and representation of the American people. The purpose of the essay is to explore the pros and cons of the electoral college, and to assess whether or not it works in a fair and representative way.  On the one hand, the electoral college system was put in place to ensure that smaller and larger states were equal in their voting rights, and to prevent a popular candidate from being elected based on a large urban populace while ignoring the needs and desires of more rural areas. The college also prevents a runaway popular vote from electing a candidate from just a few states, which could lead to a candidate who doesn't have broad support across the entire country. In addition, the electoral college is meant to provide a mechanism for party activists to have a say in the who gets to lead the party, and the party activists are an important aspect of the democratic process.  On the other hand, the electoral college system has been criticized for failing to represent the will of the people, which is seen as the fundamental problem with the system. Critics argue that the college undermines the democratic principle that one person, one vote has been an essential principle of democracy since the founding of the United States. Proponents of eliminating the electoral college argue that the system creates distortions for campaigns to win the popular vote rather than winning the hearts and minds of voters, and that the college is not responsive to the diverse needs of the American people.  It is also important to note that the electoral college system can create a "winner takes all" mentality in the political process, where the winner of one state can take all of its electoral votes, leaving the loser with nothing. This can result in candidates ignoring certain states and concentrating their efforts on others, leading to a system that doesn't represent the needs of every voter. In addition, it also leads to the candidates not discussing certain topics when candidates concentrate on certain states to win and this can lead to a situation where the candidates do not consider the issue that is important to certain states, leading to a situation where the electoral college does not represent the will of the people.  In conclusion, the electoral college system has its strengths and weaknesses. While it was designed to ensure that smaller and larger states had equal voting rights, it has been criticized for failing to represent the will of the people and creating distortions in the political process. The college's winner-takes-all mentality can also lead to the candidates ignoring certain states and certain topics, undermining the democratic principle of one person, one vote. Ultimately, whether or not the electoral college works depends on		1
Close your eyes and imagine you are giving a class and the students seem to not be paying attention but other students are paying attention. You classmates are sad , mad ,angry , tired and just want to leave school .Now open your eyes and think wouldnt you want to read the students mind ? wouldn't you want to understand ther frustration , sadness or happieness .  Teachers should be able to read to use FACS (Facial Action Coding System) to understand the students emotions expessions for multiple reasons .To start off with teachers need to understand the student to be able to connect with each other. A teacher is a leader a person to lean off of but if they are not connected on the same page because the teacher doesnt understand to students emotion epessions they wont get far . As teenagers as young adilessons there emotions are off the charts some ore than others and just like that its not good to keep all of that inside ,teacher with access to facs ( Facial Action Coding System ) cant have an encounter with the student talking about there feelings. Just like that there are many more reasons of why a teacher needs access to facs 		0
The car is a staple in modern day society by many standards, it represents wealth, societal rank however on the more negative side of the matter cars are the result of a majority of deaths in the United States. Alongside the fatalities, cars also pollute the environment that is so very delicate. The benefits of becoming carfree are immense and far outweigh the "negatives" that come alongside living without cars.  Cars as many people know see them are recognized for their glamour and attraction, but what is forgotten somewhere in the infatuation with cars is the true devastation they can cause. Cars in the United States and many other countries around the world account for a majority of the fatalities in total. Living without cars would completely irradiate the fatalities due to cars as well as reducing the stress that comes along with having such a hefty responsibility.  Along with the potential danger to humans, in the United States cars are the second largest source of emissions right behind power plants according to paragraph 34. Countries like India and China are among the top few most polluted cities on this planet now imagine the impact of implementing a carfree law. The amount of pollution would go down immensely and the effect that this would have on the lifespan of people living in those countries would be incredulous. Some will argue that this will negatively have a change on their life. And to that I would say, are you willing to sacrifice some of the comfort that a car supplies you for a better life for your children and grandchildren?  Many people acknowledge that buying a car is arguably the second largest and expensive purchases that will be made in your life second to a house. The amount of money that would be saved from living a carfree life would be incredible. Without having to pay car payments, car insurance, and gas fees every month imagine what this money could be going towards. Removing such a monetary factor would reap such high rewards that so many would agree is completely worth some of the sacrifices that would have to be made.  All in all cars are not completely necessary, and that implementing such a thing would have such a benificial outcome for society as a whole. Think not about the present but about the future of the world, and by living a carfree life you are bettering the present community as well as the future world.		0
Cars are one of thee most common theings in most countries today. Not a day goes by where a person will not see a car drive by, it has become thee main use of transportation and, for thee most part, can be thee easiest use of transportation. But, so many people have been getting cars lately, theat some problems have been arising. For example, thee gas theat cars release can be harmful to thee environment, cars overall have been making people much less active, and we can easily use electric cars instead of cars theat run on gasoline.  To begin withe, cars release chemicals from thee gasoline theat can pollute thee air. "After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear thee air of thee global city." Duffer 10. This states theat thee air has been getting so polluted theat some cities have been temporarily banning thee use of cars because of theis issue. Earthe has been getting too polluted and destroyed lately, to thee point theat some people have been trying to predict an "end is nigh" date due to all of theese issues withe earthe. Scientists have been talking about global warming for years now, and thee problems we have been having withe thee greenhouse effect and thee ozone layer. "President Obama's ambitious goals to curb thee United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest theat Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by." Elisabethe Rosentheal 29. So it seems theat thee lower use of cars by Americans has been helping thee atmosphere and postponing thee date of thee complete destruction of thee ozone layer. That was why cars have such a big impact on thee environment as a whole.  Next, cars have also been making people less active. One of thee largest issues for parents in today's world is trying to get theeir children away from thee computer, television, and cell phone. Technology has lessened thee need for toys and books, since children entertain theemselves withe games on theeir tablets or books theey download also on thee tablet. But cars play a big part in theis. When a person first gets a car, heshe feels free. You feel like thee world is yours because you can go anywhere. But thee problem is theat people become less social withe cars. Instead of going to play a sport withe some friends, most people would ratheer drive somewhere else. It is also thee reason thee United States is ranked second in country withe thee most overweight people, vehicles are so inexpensive here theat anyone is able to purchase a car and drive to theeir destination instead of riding a bicycle or skateboard and getting some real exercise. "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed theroughout thee city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smoothe sidewalks" Selsky 28. This also shows thee improvement on thee cities sidewalks and thee increase of people attending parks. Witheout cars, thee streets look better and people recieve more exercise.  Finally, thee use of cars is quite a problem but theere is anotheer solution: Electric cars. Electric cars are a new invention, and for thee past decade theey have been atempting at perfecting an electric car. The brand, Tesla , has already released a few electric cars theat seem to work quite well. The vehicles make no noise when driving, and theey even have a new "sportsy" look to theem, for the young adults theat want a nice looking car. But thee only problem is thee battery. Electric cars are being banned in some states due to thee lack of reliability withe theese batteries. They have not yet been perfected, and can cause accidents. But even withe thee risk one would be taking while driving one of theese cars on thee streets, it is still a fantastic replacement for normal cars, since it does not release anytheing theat can harm thee environment. So thee best solution would be to wait a few years until thee batteries get better and thee prices drop, theen purchase an electric car, but still know when to stop using it and ride thee bicycle instead. Combining thee use of a battery ratheer thean gasoline, and not overusing thee car, you will have thee perfect combination, which is what everybody should strive to accomplish. Help thee environment, and get thee right amount of exercise.  In thee end, cars are still one of thee most common and one of thee greatest theings on Earthe today. Getting a first car is a dream come true, but too much of it can be harmful. So get some use out of thee bicycle, avoid poisoning thee atmosphere, and cars will be a vehicle withe no reprocautions at all, and it will be thee perfect source for transportation, while keeping your morals where theey should be.		0
When each person drives a dieseltussling car, it is like several thousand smoke covered knives being thrown at the soft protective blanket up in the sky. Pollution is destroying our ozone and our environment, but now we need to face our ramifications. Autos are causing cities to form new laws banning these leeches from being driven. Car usage should be limited, because if we dont, our pollution will be worse than it already is, and using a healthy alternative to transportation will lead to a healthier life style.  Pollution produced by our main method of transportation is killing our planet. We live on the wonderful planet earth which has been generous to provide us with a home and food so we can survive, but when our home is destroyed, we will soon become extinct. Global warming is a famous term heard around the globe, and this word is not used lightly. Our world is heating up due to the many green house gasses produced by the emissions of the cars we use. These green house gasses can not escape our atmosphere which then is heated up by the sun and is melting our polar ice caps. These ice caps, not only will flood multiple cities, killing thousands if they do not escape in time, but they also hold our natural fresh water reserve. The green house gasses are affecting our seas and our skies as well. An article called Paris Bans Sriving Due to Smog , written by Robert Duffer, states that "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog... The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world." Beijing is also one of the worlds most populated countries. The terrifying smog and the rising seas are not the only factors leading to our demise. The green house gasses are producing holes in our ozone that protect us from harmful sun rays. Without the ozone, the world would not be habitable because of all the cancer humans will have by just standing in direct sunlight. We are the world, and by killing the world, we eradicate our whole species. We need to help our world with some healthy substitutions to cars.  There are several different ways transportation could be healthy for both the environment and ourselves. The worlds obesity population is higher than ever. An average amount of calories we need to consume per day is about 2000 calories and most of the world are consuming way over that limit. If we supply bicycles to cities, we could burn off those extra calories by just going to public places, events,and even jobs. Biking and walking to places not only work out your physical apearance, but also keeps our mind healthy. Exercise trigger neurotransmitters in your brain to fire off endorphins, like adrenaline, which keeps your body moving and working without putting strain on your muscles. Exercise also fires off dopamine in your mind which produces a sense of joy. Elisabeth Rosenthal wrote an article named " In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars " which interviews people from germany about their lifestyle. "'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor." Life is much more jovial with no cars, and germany knows it.  There are already different countries that have moderated and replaced their walking smoke factories to their fat burning bikes. We need to follow in their foot steps and moderate if we do not want to be left in the dark ages. The government needs to limit the amount of usage for cars, because the constant use of autos will lead to out doom via pollution, and without cars, people are more likley to live more healthy and happy lifestyle.		0
School is a place of learning. It can also be a place to get to know new people. But school lacks student participation in after school activities. Our principle has decided that all students should participate in at least¬†one after school activity. The reason why students should participate in an after school activity is sports, students council, and the yearbook.  The first reason why students should participate in an after is sports. Sports is a great way for the school to be recognized by colleges. Scouts from colleges will want to come to our games to draft kids into their college. Sports will also get the school trophies for students to brag about. Because of all of the trophies the other school sport teams will recognize the school as an actual challenge to go against.  The second reason why students should participate in an after school activity is the student council. The student council can encourage the school to do more fun activities for the students. The students council represents the students, so the students will be able to have a voice. Therefore¬†the council will know what to focus on for the schools.  The final reason why students should participate in after school activities is the year book. Having students as photographer will mean they will take decent pictures. With a lot¬†of students in the yearbook club there will be many pictures to pick from. The yearbook club will make sure students will have memories of the school.  The reason why schools should participate in an after school activity is sports, student council, and yearbook. Sports will help students get recognized by scouts, the sport team will be an actual challenge to beat, and the school will have a lot of trophies. The student council will try to get more fun activities, students will have a voice, the student council will know what to focus on. The yearbook will get students to take good pictures, because of the number of students the yearbook club will have a lot of pictures to choose from, the yearbook club will make sure the students will have memories of the year they had at school. The school needs more participation from the students. With a lot¬†of people participating in after school activities it can make the school a more fun place.		0
In the course of human existance, humanity has always been striving for progress, you might say going the extra mile, in order to better our society. One such great invention was the automobile which allowed us to travel great distances in a short period of time. Consequently, the natural instinct, to grow and improve, has been transfered to the idea of the automobile through the self driving car. Self driving cars are the future of transportation as the offer a host of positive benefits including, precise driving capabilities, increasing affordability, and new safety technology.  The self driving car has begun implementing technology that can revolutionize a car's self awarness. For example the article states, "spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3D model of the car's surroundings." Unlike the human eye, the LIDAR radar sees anything and everything; not only does it never miss a single detail, but it also has a 360 degree view that current drivers simply do not possess. These sensors are expecially useful when backing up and driving backwards, as many drivers struggle with getting a full view of what goes on behind them. However, with the LIDAR radar, this problem is eliminated, making backwards driving easier. Putting radar into the drivers seat is not so much about losing the human touch of driving, but getting a more accurate perspective on the road.  Secondly, the technology is finally in a place where self driving cars are becoming a feasible economic option. Sebastian Thrun, founder of the self driving Google car, said, "There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting. The sensors weren't there...Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars." In fact, alot of the technologies, including radar, used in self driving cars have been around for a long time. However, in recent years, they have become alot cheaper and precise, so that the dream of creating a self driving car is a reality. The goal of the self driving car was never to create a billion dollar high tech vehicle accessible only to the rich, but one that could be mass produced and avaliable to all. With cheaper, mass produced technology, it seems like this is not too far up the road.  Finally we see that the self driving car may actually be safer that regular drivers. With so many deaths accounted to texting and driving, the idea is that people would be able to safely text when the car drives itself certainly has its appeal. However, when the car needs a human touch, "displays [texting] can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not avalible to drivers trying to text with a cell phone." Shutting off the display would force drivers to pay attention to the road during tricky situations and reduce the number of car crashes. Secondly, the use of sensors helps detect and prevent crashes. The article says, "sensors have become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers. This information from the sensor can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wheels," which could stop potential dangers in their tracks that the driver may not be aware of. In the end, a self autonomus car is always vigilant and is never distracted, making it safer than having a human driver.  Self autonomous cars are more accuate, becoming cheaper, and are safer than today's cars, making them the car of the future. It is only a matter of time before someone develops a self driving car that can be mass produced, and when that day comes, we should embrace it with pride. Together, let's drive towards creating the car of tommorow, today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        		0
Having a positive attitude is one of the most beneficial things a person can do to foster success and growth in life. A positive attitude can help build upon success because it allows for setting achievable goals, encourages healthy communication, and creates an optimistic outlook on life's challenges. Examples of how a positive attitude can help lead to success are seen in the workplace, in relationships, and in everyday life. To further this success, it is important to spend time with positive people who are motivated and understanding. This can create a strong support system for one's growth in life. Furthermore, it is important to show respect and responsibility to others in order to achieve success. Not only this, but treating animals with care and kindness can also help a person realize successes and happiness in life. All these elements are valuable in contributing to successful and positive life.		1
Reasons to participate are, he thought,"He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Plus you get to go out into the sea and enjoy the veiw of the sea's.  And it is a fun job for example," Luke found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time."  And he could see the lands of other countrys and what they do. For example, "He was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke also toured and excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china. And he was doing service to, so you don't have to join the military.  It made him more aware of people from other countries needs. And that awareness can help you if you get lost in a diffrent country. And it opens up the world to the Seagoing Cowboy because they get to go on trips to diffrent countries and see what the world needs. So participating is a great way to learn about the world and the people in diffrent countries.		0
The world we live in is a crazy, stressful place! We should always take a step back and think about the times when we were in kindergarten¬†and life was enjoyable because we used to tell our teachers what kind of projects and activities we would like to do in our breaks. When I was in kindergarten, me and my friends used to tell our teachers what kind of projects we would love to do. Imagine if the projects were student designed, it would make summer breaks so much better and fun. When did everyone started to make life so complicated? We should embrace the simplicity of our childhood. We were taught by our teachers and parents to do what we love for a reason. Just because they seem basic doesn't mean they will stop mattering in our lives. Although a lot¬†of people say summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers know what's best for us and what we should learn, it is important for the projects to be student designed because student's can communicate with each other during summer breaks, they will be productive, they can focus better and be happy.  If the project's are student designed, students will be able to communicate with each other during their breaks. They would talk to each other: learn how to manage time and complete the project's and it will help them when they enter work force. By working on projects together, student's will make stronger friendships and relation's with each other. If they have projects which include communicating with each another, it will make sure they are in touch with their friend's. Some students don't call their friends which ends up losing connection with them: tasks which include communication will make sure they are in touch. Students will make good bonds and ties with their friends which is going to be really helpful when they are in need of their friends. The project's should include going to the stream or river and capturing the water and bringing it to school and testing it in the lab, as a result student's will learn time management. Student's can work with their friend's to reach a common goal. Most student's nowadays sit at home in their rooms all day long, play video games, and don't spend doing activities outdoor which is not healthy. When I have summer breaks, I just sit at home, watch videos in my home and don't step out of the house because the projects are teacher designed which are not fun. In elementary school, the projects were student designed which made life so much better. When student's enter work force, students will be working with individuals and should know how to handle situations and manage their time. That's why student's should have projects which include collaboration. This is why the project's should be student designed and include outdoor activities so that student's can go out and explore new things and stay in touch.  If the project's are student designed, student's will stay busy and productive. If they have multiple projects they love to do, they will always make out time to do it, which is going to keep them busy and make them appreciate their time and things they have. If student's are busy during their summer breaks, it will make sure that they stay out of trouble since most kid's just sit at home, waste their whole time of summer breaks, and do nothing which result's in getting them in trouble by their parent's. Parent's want their student's to be productive during breaks, student designed project's will make sure they stay busy and that they are always being productive. It will make sure student's understand work and play balance which is really important for them when they grow up and get a job. In my summer breaks, I just waste my time being on the phone and not do anything productive. If the tasks were student designed, I would love doing them. It would help me understand time management and how to be productive which is really important in our daily lives.  Student designed projects make you focus and make you happy because it's a project you love doing. It would give you less stress because you would know that it's student designed and working on it will make you happy. Students will be happy that they have some of their favorite task to do since summer break is all boring and there is nothing to do. They will know how to be responsible by doing their tasks and not waste their time. They will understand time value and how to work by themselves. Student's can get to know more about themselves, figure out who they really are, and what kind of activities they love to do. If they had a long day, coming home and realizing they have their favorite project to do would make them really happy. When I have a bad day at work, I come home and figure out I have a project to do makes me really excited about it. Working on my favorite project makes me focus better and makes me feel I know what I'm doing. This is why summer project's should be something which makes student's happy and focus better.  Some people say projects should be teacher designed because teacher's know what you should be learning in the grade you are in; however, student designed projects are important because students can communicate with their peers and have strong bonds, be busy and productive by working on tasks, and to focus better and be responsible.  Student designed projects will benefit students the most and help them in their daily lives by having them know the value of time, how to work with individuals, and how to have stronger communities and relations. These are really important when we get older and life becomes complicated.   ¬†   ¬†		0
Title: The Power of Praise and Achievements on Student Confidence  As an 8th grader, I have learned that praise and achievements play a significant role in shaping a student's self-esteem and confidence. When we receive praise and accomplish things, it boosts our self-esteem and makes us feel good about ourselves. In this essay, I will explain how both contribute to the development of a student's confidence.  Firstly, praise is essential in building a student's self-esteem. When we receive praise from teachers, peers, or parents, it makes us feel appreciated and valued. It lets us know that our efforts are recognized and appreciated, which in turn boosts our confidence. For instance, if I receive an A on a test, my parents will praise me for my hard work, and it makes me feel proud of myself. This feeling of pride and appreciation motivates me to work harder and strive for better grades in the future.  Secondly, achievements are also crucial in developing a student's confidence. When we achieve something, whether it's academic or extracurricular, it gives us a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. It makes us feel like we are capable of achieving our goals and that our efforts are paying off. For example, if I make the school soccer team, it gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment, and it boosts my confidence in my abilities.  Moreover, both praise and achievements help students develop a growth mindset. When we receive praise and achieve things, it encourages us to take risks and push ourselves beyond our limits. It makes us believe that we can accomplish anything we set our minds to, and that our efforts will be rewarded. This mindset helps us to embrace challenges and view them as opportunities for growth and learning.  In conclusion, praise and achievements are crucial in developing a student's confidence. When we receive praise and accomplish things, it boosts our self-esteem and motivates us to work harder. Both contribute to the development of a student's confidence by giving us a sense of pride, appreciation, and accomplishment. Therefore, it is essential for teachers, peers, and parents to recognize and encourage students'		1
Dear Principle  Cell phones have been a great hassle in schools seeing as kids use them to send messages to each other or call each other. But cell phones can also be an important thing to carry around. I am writing this letter to you to help you on a decision on the schools cell phone policy. With the two possible choices there are i like policy 1 the best.  Policy number one states that students are allowed to bring there phones to school and use them freely. To me this seems like a not thought out plan because the student are already with there friends so why would they need to use them at school. The only time cell phones would be necessary at school would be during an emergency. But this is also helpful incase a student forgets something at home or has an accident they can call there parents or who ever to come and help them.  Policy 2 states that students aren't allowed to have phones at school at all. Honestly that doesn't sound like a good idea because of the reason that there going to use it anyway. Most students will use there phones in school anyway wet her or not you say they cant. If this policy is chosen there would be a lot more problems at school. More students will get caught with there cell phones out and get in trouble.  Policy 1 is the better choice in this dispute between policy's because there would be less students in trouble. Policy 2 would only bring more trouble to schools and more work for principles or counsellors. Policy 1 is the more fare and equal one and well its a lot of fun to use your phone. So go with policy 1 it will save you time and a lot of disputes between parents and students.		0
**Driverless Cars: A Boon or a Bane?**  Driverless cars are a hot topic of debate these days. Some people believe that they are the future of transportation, while others are concerned about the safety and ethical implications of autonomous vehicles. In this essay, I will argue that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the risks.  **Benefits of Driverless Cars**  There are many potential benefits to driverless cars. First, they could significantly reduce traffic accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), over 3 million people are injured and 30,000 people are killed in car accidents each year in the United States. Driverless cars could eliminate human error, which is a major cause of accidents. A study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that driverless cars could reduce accidents by up to 90%.  Second, driverless cars could make our roads more efficient. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and driverless cars could help to alleviate it. By communicating with each other and with traffic signals, driverless cars could travel in closer proximity to one another, which would reduce congestion and make traffic flow more smoothly.  Third, driverless cars could make travel more convenient. People could use their time in the car to work, relax, or socialize. They would no longer have to worry about driving, which could reduce stress and make their commutes more enjoyable.  **Drawbacks of Driverless Cars**  There are also some potential drawbacks to driverless cars. One concern is that they could be hacked. A malicious hacker could take control of a driverless car and cause it to crash or drive erratically. This could pose a serious safety risk.  Another concern is that driverless cars could lead to job losses. Many people are employed in the transportation industry, and driverless cars could automate these jobs. This could have a negative impact on the economy.  **Conclusion**  The benefits of driverless cars outweigh the risks. They could significantly reduce traffic accidents, make our roads more efficient, and make travel more convenient. While there are some potential drawbacks, these risks can be mitigated through careful regulation. I believe that driverless cars will make our roads safer, our cities more livable, and our lives easier.  **Factual Inaccuracy**  The NHTSA estimates that 3 million people are injured and 30,000 people are killed in car accidents each year in the United States.  **Spelling Errors**  * **automation** instead of **autonomous** * **commutes** instead of **commutes**		1
 The face on Mars is a fascinating topic that has captured the imagination of scientists and space enthusiasts alike for years. The face is a vast mountain range that stretches over 1,000 miles in diameter, with peaks that are twice the height of Mount Everest. This impressive feature on the planet has been a subject of much contention and speculation, with some experts suggesting that it could be remnants of an ancient civilization that once thrived on Mars.  Over the years, NASA has sent several satellites to Mars to collect data on the face. One of the most recent missions, the Mars Science Laboratory, landed on Mars in 2012 and sent back stunning images of the face. These images reveal a complex landscape with deep valleys and towering cliffs. But the most intriguing feature is a large dark patch that stretches over several hundred miles, which experts believe is a type of dark basaltic lava flow.  The dark patch is particularly mysterious because it is completely different from the rest of the face. It is almost twice as dark as the surrounding rocks, which makes it stand out against the reddish-brown backdrop of Mars. Scientists have been trying to study this feature in detail to determine its origins and significance. Some theories suggest that it is the result of a volcanic eruption, while others believe it may be evidence of a massive impact that occurred on Mars in the distant past.  Despite the many mysteries surrounding the face on Mars, scientists are making headway in understanding this incredible feature. They are studying the geology of the face, the composition of the rocks, and the patterns of erosion and weathering to gain clues about the planet's past. They are also trying to determine whether the face is a natural feature or if it was created by humans.  Many scientists believe that the face on Mars may indeed be remnants of an ancient civilization that once thrived on the planet. Some have suggested that the dark patch could be the result of volcanic activity, which could have created a habitat for early Martian life. Others believe that the dark patch could be evidence of an ancient landslide that destroyed a nearby city, or even the remnants of an ancient riverbed.  In conclusion, the face on Mars is a fascinating topic that continues to capture the imagination of scientists and space enthusiasts alike. While there are many mysteries surrounding this incredible feature, scientists are making headway in understanding its origins and significance. Whether the face is a natural feature or a remnant of an ancient civilization, it is clear that it holds important clues about the planet's past and the possibility of life on other planets.		1
"You can live in your car, but you can't drive your house." This is a quote my teacher used to tell me as advise for the future. This was a way of saving money if you had to choose between paying rent or paying your car bills if you were in this situation. However, what he did not realize is its more useful to use less of your car.  Using less of your car improves the enviroment. Using less will reduce the pollution in the air that we breathe in. When we reduce our car use we reduce the amount of resources like fossil fuels and nonreuseable resources. When we use cars and create pollution we also create a smog, but when we stop using cars we can clear the smog. In paris, they banned car use for a certain amount of time and it reduced the amount of smog. In fact, in the article  Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog , it says "The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."  Another thing that reduces is your payments for your car. How can you pay for a car if you don't have one? The answer is you don't. Without a car you don't have to pay car payments or repair payments. You also don't have to worry about getting fines or looking for parking spaces. In the article  In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , it reads "Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park- large garages at the edge of the develpment, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."  If you are not already worried with you car payments, you would be worried about your children's safety. Accidents happen all the time from cars. And if you're not in an accident you could be the one with a car breakdown on your way to work. Now you may say, I need a car because I have to drive to work or drop my kids at school. Than here is a solution, in the article  The End of Car Culture it says, "Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has fascilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."  My teacher's quote about paying for cars is more useful than paying rent is incorrect. Using less of your car is an advantage to improving the environment, spending less money, and increasing safety in the world.    		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.  The Electoral College is an outdated system that is no longer relevant to our modern society. It was created in the 18th century, when the United States was a very different country. The Founding Fathers were concerned that a direct election of the President would give too much power to the large states, and the Electoral College was a way to balance the power between the states.  However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary. The United States is now a much more united country, and the large states no longer have the same disproportionate power that they did in the 18th century. In fact, the Electoral College actually gives more power to the small states, since each state has the same number of electors as it has members of Congress.  The Electoral College also makes it possible for a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. When this happens, it undermines the legitimacy of the election and disenfranchises millions of voters.  There are many arguments in favor of abolishing the Electoral College. First, it is a system that is no longer relevant to our modern society. Second, it gives too much power to the small states. Third, it makes it possible for a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote.  I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Should students really be making the summer projects? Students making the summer projects would help the students focus more on the project, help make the project less stressful, and could figure out a way to involve their family.  If a student designes a project they are going to make sure it interests them. They aren't going to make it something they dont want to do. Some might say the students aren't going to know what information to learn and use in the project. If teachers work with students they can figure out a way to make sure that they students learn all the information they need to. Teachers can even give them a rubric with all the information the students need to use.  When you are doing something that you enjoy you stress about it less. Especially when you're on summer vacation doing a summer project is the last thing that you want to be doing. Kids would much rather hang out with friends or play video games. If students are designing the projects they will design something that is less time consuming or more easy to manage . While some agree with this others are concered that students would make the project too easy. Teachers at the end of the day are assigning the project, they can put guidelines and expectations on top of the students project design.  During summer vacation lots of students will travel and go places with family. Students can figure out a way to involve family members making the project easier to do on the road. Having a parent help out on a project helps out and helps kids stress less. While doing a project with family members might distract students from learning some say doing a project with parents might help kids focus as well. No kid wants to mess around during a project with their parents.  In conclusion, there are many benefits to allowing the students to design their own project. If students were to be allowed to design their own summer projects it would help students focus more on the project, it wouldn't be a super stressful project and students could involve their family.¬†		0
  Dear [State Senator],  As a concerned citizen and student, I urge you to consider the importance of preserving the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I believe that it serves several crucial purposes that would be compromised by abolishing it.  Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that the President is elected through a system that is fair and representative of the will of the people. The winner of the popular vote does not always win the presidency, and this is particularly evident in close elections. In 2000, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election due to his electoral vote lead. The Electoral College system allows for a more accurate reflection of the distribution of votes across the country, rather than simply relying on the most popular vote.  Secondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign across the country, rather than focusing solely on heavily populated areas. As Bradford Plumer notes in "The Indefensible Electoral College," candidates are less likely to campaign in states they know they will not win, which means that voters in swing states receive more attention from the candidates (Plumer). This ensures that every vote counts and that voters in all states are considered during the election.  Thirdly, the Electoral College provides a safety net against the possibility of a tie in the electoral vote. As Judge Posner argues in "In Defense of the Electoral College," a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The Electoral College system ensures that the President is elected through a clear and decisive process, rather than relying on a potentially contentious popular vote.		1
Dear Senator, I feel the need to bring the Electoral College to your attention. I think keeping the Electoral College is not a good way to vote for the president of the United States. It's an unfair way to vote. 538 electors and the majority of 270 votes to elect the president seems to have problems every time. If the person running for office has more votes it obviously means they want that person to win the election. So why go around that process and change everything and make it more difficult for the person to win? People all over keep trying to change things with voting but don't have a choice. When they vote for someone in office it doesn't equal a whole percent which actually goes towards whether or not they will or will not be president. Thanks to the Electoral College it makes things harder. Thats's why people don't like to vote. So Senator, please think about getting rid of the Electoral College it's fair that the person with the most votes should win because if everyone voted for them they wanted that person to win. That's more fair than popular votes and then what the other 538 people have to say.  Sincerly,  PROPER_NAME    		0
Hey there!  So, distant learning... hmmm... let me tell you, it's pretty cool!  Like, think about it, we can learn from the comfort of our own homes! No more waking up early for school, no more cramped bus rides, no more annoying classmates . It's like, the ultimate flexibility!   And let's be real, technology is like, super important for us millennials.  We're all about those TikTok videos and Instagram reels, right?  But seriously, technology has made learning so much more accessible. With video conferencing and online courses, we can connect with teachers and classmates from all over the world! It's like, a global classroom!   And the best part? It's not just about the convenience. Distant learning can actually be more engaging than traditional classrooms!  Think about it, we can watch videos, participate in discussions, and even collaborate on group projects with people from different cultures and backgrounds!  It's like, a melting pot of knowledge and diversity!   Plus, with the rise of social media and online communities, we can connect with other students and learn from their experiences. It's like, a never-ending cycle of learning and growth!  And who knows, maybe one day we'll even have virtual reality field trips!   Of course, there are some downsides too. Like, what if the internet connection is bad?  Or what if we get distracted by our phones?  But honestly, those are just minor setbacks. The benefits of distant learning far outweigh the drawbacks!   So there you have it, folks! Distant learning is the way of the future!  And who knows, maybe one day we'll be able to learn from robots!  Just kidd		1
Making the right choice is easier said than done, but what an unfortunate amount of people don't realize, is that all the help they need to make a better choice, is a simple solution. They just need to talk. Although a simple solution, a sizable amount of people don't even bother to ask others for advice, even when there's enough benefits to fill up an entire essay. Seeking multiple opinions or advice can help someone make a better choice because he or she will acquire advice¬†from different people, learn advice¬†that was earned by experience, and will be able to use advice and opinions from the past.  Conversely, opinions from different people may help an individual make a better choice, for a number of reasons. Firstly, advice from multiple people gives you different perspectives on a matter. Using differing points of view lets you think about a problem in a different way, letting you take a different approach. Varying perspectives may even help you come to a better choice quicker. Not only that, the right choice to a problem almost always requires a diversity in perspectives, but the usefulness of others' advice doesn't stop there. Advice from multiple people also means different opinions. Even if no¬†opinions¬†are satisfactory,¬†advice¬†can be tweaked to one's liking, a combination of some, or compared.  Then, there's the opinions that don't need change. The ones that have been earned from others' experience. These essential opinions help make better choices because they're based on experiences that have actually happened. For obvious reasons, these opinions are reliable, not to mention the person sharing said advice believes that it would help your situation as well. That's not all. Opinions from experience narrows down the choices to make. This can really help making a better choice that much easier. Not only does it show a perfect solution, it helps to make the decision faster, without stressing too much over it.  Finally, a solution that doesn't require asking anyone for help, is remembering advice gained before. This solution also helps to cut down on time to make a better decision, and could amass more advice than if one had asked for opinions from others. This solution doesn't restrict itself to just oneself. Individuals may also look into their friends and family's past. Because friends and family are the closest to a person, one may easily be able to recall events and advice given to close ones.  These are some easy solutions one shouldn't try to miss when faced with a decision. You could learn different points of view, real advice that could be applied to yourself, or learn to remember the past, but in the end, they're all telling the same thing. Something that "...an unfortunate amount of people don't realize." Just talk. It's easier than you might think.		0
Dear Senator, I heartily agree that we the people should keep the electoral College. Like you may already know, "the ElectoralCcollege is a process, not a place." Our founding fathers have made it, and as we look back into history, we realize that they were right about how a lot of things run in the U.S., so why should we question them now? Even we too as citizens know that they were right for making the Electoral College. As much as we aren't a citizen ruled society, we aren't a totalitarian society either.  A really good reason for having the Electoral College is simply recognized by saying that it kind of gives usthe citizens of America the "power" to vote for our president, rather than it being inherited, or voted upon solely by government officials, or some random process like in North Korea where Kim Jung Uun gets voted because he basically brainwashed his people into loving him. It gives us a certainty that we can chose the betterment for America. Also, though roughly half of the U.S. might agree, and the other half might disagree, you are entitled to your own opinion, and voting gives you the chance to show your opinion about whom you believe should be able to run our beautiful homeland as our trusted founding fathers once did, as president.  I'm sure that it has come to you that their are, in fact, several great reasons for allowing the Electoral college still run, but their is a couple of downsides. First off, the people within the Electoral College that vote for us citizens, don't vote for each individual person, they vote based upon who is voted the most in their relative area in whichever state their in, so the people don't all get their votes out. This could have turned several presidential elections around and helped the man or woman that lost in the election to win it.  After seeing the great pro's and the tiny con's, I'm sure your settled upon the opinion of holding on to the Electoral College,though you are entitled to your own opinion, you can't deny the facts.		0
In some schools, they have started to include meditation and mindfulness practices in the daily routine. These practices are meant to help students relax and concentrate, but I am against the inclusion of these practices in schools. In this essay, I will explain my reasons for being against these practices.  Firstly, meditation and mindfulness practices are not for everyone. Some students may find it hard to concentrate when they are asked to sit still and clear their minds. Instead of helping these students, these practices may cause them to become more anxious and stressed out. For example, my friend who has ADHD finds it very difficult to sit still for more than a few minutes, and asking her to clear her mind would only make her feel more frustrated.  Secondly, these practices may be seen as a waste of time by some students. In a typical school day, there is already a lot of material that needs to be covered in each class. Adding another activity may cause students to fall behind on their work and may not be the best use of their time. Additionally, some students may not take these practices seriously, and may use the time to goof around or talk to their friends, which would defeat the purpose of these practices.  Lastly, these practices may be seen as a form of religion and may not be appropriate for all students. Mindfulness practices are often associated with Buddhism, and some students may not feel comfortable participating in these practices if they come from a different religious background. It is important to respect students' beliefs and not force them to participate in activities that go against their values.  In conclusion, I believe that meditation and mindfulness practices should not be included in schools. While these practices may work for some students, they may also cause others to become more stressed out and anxious. Additionally, these practices may be seen as a waste of time, and may not be appropriate for all students. Rather than implementing these practices, schools should focus on finding new ways to help students concentrate and relax that are more inclusive and respectful of all students' beliefs and values.		1
As an eighth-grade student, I believe that extending the school day can have both positive and negative consequences. While it may seem like a good idea to give students more time to learn and study, there are also potential drawbacks to consider.  On the one hand, extending the school day could provide students with more opportunities to learn and grow. With more time, students could engage in more in-depth discussions and activities that promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, students could have more time to work on projects and assignments, which could help them develop better study habits and improve their grades.  However, there are also potential downsides to extending the school day. For one, students may become overworked and stressed, which could negatively impact their mental health and well-being. Additionally, students may have less time for extracurricular activities and hobbies, which could lead to a lack of balance in their lives.  Another potential downside of extending the school day is that it could be difficult for students to maintain their focus and concentration. After a long day at school, students may struggle to stay engaged and motivated, which could lead to a decline in the quality of their work.  In conclusion, while extending the school day may have some benefits, it is important to carefully consider the potential drawbacks as well. It may be more effective to focus on improving the quality of the school day, rather than simply extending it. This could involve providing students with more opportunities for rest and relaxation, as well as offering more engaging and interactive learning experiences. Ultimately, the goal should be to help students succeed academically and personally, rather than simply to keep them in school for longer hours.		1
The autonomous car- a dream of many people for years on years, but it seems that the time has come. We today have the technology and ability to make it happen. Though it may seem marvelous and a load off of the drivers shoulders, maybe taking a deeper look would be beneficial. Is it really as great of an idea as it seems?  Autonomous cars, or self driving cars, have truly been around since 2009 with the company Google. What may suprise people is that these cars do not completely control themselves. There still has to be a person alert and ready to take control at any given moment. The technology for these vehicles is very advanced, but they cannot maneuver through construction sites or back out of drive ways. As amazing as these vehicles are in theory, what is the use of a SEMI-self driving car?  Not only do humans have to be armed and ready to hop to the wheel (or in some cases, keep their hands planted on the wheel at all times), there is never any guarantee that the technology will not fail. If one of the cars were to fail, it would more than likely cause a large wreck and injure at least the driver. Not only is it a safety concern, but also the relationship between the buyer and seller is compromised. If someone were to be injured in a car that was supposed to keep them safe, who is responsible? Is it the blame of the company or the owner of the vehicle?  As many know, technology can only do what it is programmed to do. A computer cannot console you when your cat dies, neither can an autonomous car make spurt of the moment decisions on what to do. In situations such as somebody quickly pulling out in front of you, the car would slow down too quickly or possibly completely come to a stop. That could cause many safety hazards to the driver and the people around them. If presented with a different, more severe situation, who knows what could happen?  Though there may be some pros to having an autonomous car, they do not out weigh the cons of it. It is far too much of a safety concern to have driverless cars on our roads. Just like people, technology can make mistakes or fail. The idea of driverless cars should be abandonned, for they do not propose any true benefits.		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I don't think you should make the policy change because many students are a grade C average and many of those students want to get involve in sports and they won't be able to do sports because they are a grade C average. I think you should make a policy requiring students having grades C and above to participate in sports.  Most of the students will not feel happy if you change the policy because they won't be able to participate in any sport. So I think that changing the policy isn't a good idea. TEACHER_NAME please don't change the policy because i won't be very happy and i won't be able to participate in sports niether. Remember many of the students are interested in sports and are mostly grade C average. If you change the policy there won't be a lot of students involve in sports because there is more grade C students.  So i think it would be a good idea if you would change the policy so that students from grade C and above could participate in sports that way there would be basketball teams,Soccer Teams,And Other sport teams. Most of the students would be happy if you would make this policy.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME      		0
I believe that the use of the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom or the community around us. This technology would help show how others are feeling when they are hiding their emotions. This would help because since the Facial Action Coding System is pretty accurate, we are able to use this in future generations to specify emotions from other people and know how they are feeling to help those around us in the world.  When people are sad, mad, or even fearful, we can help those around us who are feeling down and comfort them. We can bring joy in the world by the people who are enjoying life and be with those who are happy by bringing those who are sad, mad, and fearful into the "happy" environment so they don't have to worry. Studies show in this article that, "'Most of us have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys... specific emotion.' and also, 'Most communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' Dr. Huang predicts." This proves that since not many of us in this world knows what our expressions are to see our specific emotion, especially during nonverbal communication, it would be best to see what their real emotions are and know what they are going through (or if they're just fine) and ask if they want help or need comfort. We could help out others who are going through things even if they don't need help. If they don't want to be comforted, we can always respect their privacy. But it would be best to know what others go through to respect those around us more often. We shouldn't offend and judge people in general because we don't know what others go through and how they feel when we do judge and offend them. It would be kind and respectful to help those out around us to make the world a better place.  This system would help to read emotional expressions in a classroom because it would help the learning environment and the students in the class when the teachers are teaching. This would especially help the teachers more because teachers have trouble knowing what students are going through and can help their students out during class if they need help when they are troubled in their subject of math, science, English, ect. Most of the time, students don't want to let the teachers know if they're worried about an assignment or sad about their grade and don't want to get help from the teachers. If teachers knew their students emotions, they would have a better interaction and communication with their students and help them learn better in class, understanding the subject more. Studies show in this article that, "'A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like a effective human instructor."' This proves that since teachers want their students to be successful in their subjects, this system could help students and especially teachers to know when to help each other out when they are confused on a specific part in the subject and have a better understanding in the subject when the teachers do help out the students. This could also help because when a student is going through something and is distraced in class, the teacher would know their emotion and take it easy on them during class and help out the student with their problem and what they go through to have a better understanding and interaction with the student.  In conclusion, The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom and the community around us to help those around us in the world and get a better understanding of people and their emotions to make the world a better place to live in by comforting others who need help and showing kindness. 		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my concern about the Electoral College and to urge you to support a national popular vote for the President of the United States.  The Electoral College is an outdated system that is no longer representative of the American people. In the past, the Electoral College made sense because it was designed to protect the interests of small states. However, that is no longer the case. Today, the Electoral College gives disproportionate power to a handful of swing states, while ignoring the votes of millions of Americans in other states.  This is unfair and undemocratic. Every vote should count equally, regardless of where a person lives. The Electoral College prevents that from happening.  I understand that there are some who argue that the Electoral College is necessary to protect the interests of rural voters. However, I believe that this is a false argument. Rural voters are already well-represented in the Senate, which gives each state two senators, regardless of population. There is no need to further overrepresent rural voters in the Electoral College.  The Electoral College is a relic of the past that has no place in our modern democracy. I urge you to support a national popular vote for President. This would ensure that the person who wins the most votes wins the election, and it would give a voice to all Americans, regardless of where they live.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
So close, yet so far away. Venus, also known as the evening star or Earths twin is so close yet we know so little about it. Witch gives us all the reasons to find out more, after all wouldnt you want to know what your liveing by? In the artivcle " The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the auther has meny great points describeing why we need to know more about Venus, and why studying Venus is a worthy prusite despite the dangers that may come along with it.  In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the auther talks alot about why we need to explore Venus. He/she says how no humen has ever been to Venus and how it may be for the best because no space ship has lasted for more then a few hours on Venus. In the text the auther said," Numerous facotrs contribute to Venus's reputation as a challangeing planet for humans to study, despite its proxinity to us." The auther is saying how althow resrving Venus may be dangrous it is worth it to know more about the planet. The auther tells how NASA is working on differnt approaches to study Venus and how they are looking back on old technology called mechanical computurs, witched played a inportant role in the 1940s durning WW2, but was orginaly invented in the 1800s. The reason why they are thinking about useing mechnal computurs is because they are more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.  All together NASA is trying to find new ways to study this misterous planent that we live so close to. It may take years before we can truely study Venus but in the long run knowing more about Venus will positivly effect us just due to the fact that we know more about our surroundings and mabye one day, far into the feature we will find a place in Venus, a place where we can call home.      		0
As an eighth-grade student, I have had the opportunity to attend both traditional school and online classes. While both have their advantages, I strongly believe that attending school in person is more beneficial. In this essay, I will argue why attending school is more beneficial than attending online classes and provide examples of the ways it is more beneficial.  Firstly, attending school in person allows for more opportunities for social interaction. School provides a platform for students to interact with their peers and form meaningful relationships. This interaction helps students develop important social skills such as communication, teamwork, and empathy. For example, when working on group projects, students learn to collaborate with others and compromise to achieve a common goal. Additionally, attending school in person allows for the opportunity to build friendships and participate in extracurricular activities. These experiences help students develop a sense of community and belonging.  Secondly, attending school in person allows for more opportunities for hands-on learning. Many subjects require practical experience and experimentation, which can only be gained through in-person instruction. For example, in science class, students can conduct experiments and analyze data in a lab setting. In art class, students can work on their projects under the guidance of a teacher. These hands-on experiences help students develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter and gain valuable skills that will benefit them in the future.  Lastly, attending school in person provides a structured learning environment. School provides a schedule and routine that helps students stay organized and focused. This structure helps students develop important time management skills that will benefit them in the future. Additionally, attending school in person provides a sense of accountability. Students are expected to attend class and complete assignments on time, which helps them develop responsibility and self-discipline.  In conclusion, attending school in person has numerous benefits that cannot be replicated by online classes. The opportunities for social interaction, hands-on learning, and a structured learning environment all contribute to a more well-rounded and successful educational experience. While online classes may have their advantages, I strongly believe that attending school in person is the best option for students.		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a system that was created in the 18th century that is no longer relevant in the 21st century. It is a system that gives more power to some states than others, and it is a system that has been used to disenfranchise voters.  The Electoral College is a system in which each state is given a number of electors equal to the number of seats it has in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district. This means that a candidate can win the popular vote nationwide, but still lose the election if they do not win the popular vote in enough states.  This system is unfair because it gives more power to some states than others. A voter in Wyoming, for example, has more power than a voter in California, because Wyoming has one electoral vote for every 199,000 people, while California has one electoral vote for every 710,000 people. This means that a voter in Wyoming has about four times as much power as a voter in California.  The Electoral College is also a system that has been used to disenfranchise voters. In the 2000 election, for example, Al Gore won the popular vote by more than 500,000 votes, but he lost the election to George W. Bush because he did not win the popular vote in enough states. This means that millions of voters who voted for Al Gore had their votes essentially thrown away.  I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is an outdated system that is no longer relevant in the 21st century. It is a system that gives more power to some states than others, and it is a system that has been used to disenfranchise voters.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Dear Principal,   I am writing to you regarding the proposal to require all students to perform community service. While helping the community is undoubtedly a worthy cause, I do not think mandatory service is the best approach. There are better ways to encourage volunteering that do not infringe on students' freedom or compromise the spirit of service.  Requiring community service risks transforming a meaningful activity into an obligatory chore. When service is forced, it loses the intrinsic motivation that comes from choosing to help others. Students may resent being told what to do with their free time and go through the motions without gaining real experience or insight. True community service should come from a place of care and compassion, not duty.   Instead of mandates, our school could promote service through lead-by-example programs. Staff and older students who are already involved in their communities can share their experiences and inspire others to volunteer. Recognizing student volunteers publicly can help build a culture where service is an valued option. Educational assemblies or discussions about local issues can spark students' interests in getting involved.   Giving students the freedom to choose how to spend their discretionary hours respects their autonomy and responsibilities outside of school. Not all have the ability or desire to volunteer regularly due to jobs, family obligations or other commitments. For community service to be most effective, it must engage individuals ?passions and accommodate their circumstances. Mandates risk having the opposite effect.  While the intention behind required service is admirable, optional and lead-by-example approaches are more likely to foster long-term volunteering habits. Students will serve not because they must, but because they want to make a meaningful difference. I hope you will consider alternative strategies that encourage rather than enforce community participation. Our communities would be well-served by volunteers who care deeply, not ones who feel they have no choice.  Thank you for consideration of my viewpoint. Please let me know if there is any other way I could support volunteer efforts at our school.  Sincerely, [Your name]		1
Title: Limiting Car Usage: The Advantages  In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the negative impact cars have on the environment and our quality of life. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and they contribute to climate change. They also take up a lot of space, which can lead to urban sprawl and traffic congestion.  There are many reasons why we should limit car usage. First, cars pollute the air. When cars burn gasoline, they release harmful emissions into the air. These emissions can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Cars also contribute to climate change. When gasoline is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, which traps heat and warms the planet.  Second, cars take up a lot of space. Cars need to be parked somewhere, and this space can be used for other things, such as housing, parks, or businesses. Cars also contribute to urban sprawl. As more people move to the suburbs, they need to drive to work, school, and other activities. This leads to more traffic congestion and more pollution.  Third, cars are expensive. The cost of owning a car includes the purchase price, insurance, gas, and maintenance. The cost of driving is also high, especially in urban areas where parking is expensive.  Fourth, cars are dangerous. Every year, thousands of people are killed or injured in car accidents. Cars are also a major source of noise pollution.  Fifth, cars are not always necessary. Many people can walk, bike, or take public transportation to their destinations. There are also many car-sharing services available.  There are many things we can do to limit car usage. We can walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving. We can also carpool or take ride-sharing services. We can live in a walkable neighborhood or take a job that is close to home. We can also support policies that encourage people to use alternative forms of transportation, such as bike lanes and public transportation.  Limiting car usage has many benefits. It can improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save money, and reduce traffic congestion. It can also make our cities more livable and our communities more connected.  Let's all do our part to limit car usage and make the world a cleaner, healthier place.		1
 Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are becoming a growing concern in society. The concept of having a car that can drive itself without any human intervention has been studied for many years, and researchers are now making strides in making this a reality. While the idea of driverless cars may seem exciting, there are numerous concerns and challenges that must be addressed before these vehicles can become widespread. In this essay, we will examine the current state of driverless cars, the pros and cons of having a vehicle that operates without human intervention, and the ethical and philosophical questions raised by this technology.  First, let us take a look at the current state of driverless cars. While many automakers have announced plans to develop self-driving cars, there are currently only a few models available on the market. These include the Tesla Model S and X, both of which have features that allow the car to drive itself in certain situations. Other automakers, such as General Motors and Ford, are also making strides in developing driverless technology, and some experts predict that within the next few years, fully autonomous cars will become more widely available.  One of the main advantages of driverless cars is the potential to reduce accidents caused by human error. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, human error was a contributing factor in 94% of car accidents in the United States in 2018. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to eliminate this risk entirely, as they can be programmed to operate safely and efficiently without any human intervention. This could mean fewer accidents on the roads, resulting in fewer injuries and fatalities.  Another advantage of driverless cars is the potential to reduce traffic congestion. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with sensors that can communicate with one another, allowing them to navigate through traffic more efficiently. This could result in faster travel times and a reduction in the number of cars on the road. In addition, driverless cars can be programmed to operate in a way that minimizes fuel consumption, resulting in lower emissions and a greener future.  Despite these advantages, there are also concerns about the impact of driverless cars on society. One major concern is the potential for job loss. As the technology becomes more widespread, there could be a significant reduction in the number of jobs available in the taxi, trucking, and delivery industries. While proponents of driverless cars argue that this will lead to new jobs in areas such as software development and maintenance, there are still worries about the economic impact on those who may be displaced.  Another concern is the potential for driverless cars to reduce the amount of time people spend driving and interacting with others. While this technology has the potential to make travel safer and more efficient, it could also lead to a reduction in face-to-face interactions and socializing. This could have negative impacts on mental health and relationships, particularly for those who may not have access to other forms of social interaction.  Finally, there are ethical and philosophical questions raised by the development of driverless cars. One major concern is the issue of responsibility in the event of an accident. If a car is programmed to operate autonomously and something goes wrong, who is responsible for the accident? Is it the driver, the manufacturer, or the software developer? Another issue is the potential for driverless cars to perpetuate existing biases and inequalities. For example, if autonomous vehicles are more expensive and difficult to maintain, this could limit access to these vehicles for low-income individuals.  In conclusion, driverless cars		1
Technology has become an integral part of our lives. It has brought numerous benefits, such as increased efficiency and convenience. However, it also has its drawbacks, which can have a negative impact on individuals and society as a whole. In this essay, I will explore the different ways in which technology can have a positive or negative impact on people, analyze the potential consequences of a lack of communication due to technology, examine ways in which children can become overly obsessed with technology, explore the benefits of technology in regards to work schedules and shopping, investigate how technology has helped in the medical field and saved lives, and discuss how technology can be used to improve education.  One of the most significant benefits of technology is its ability to increase efficiency and convenience. For example, technology has revolutionized the way we work by allowing us to communicate and collaborate more easily. It has also made it possible for us to shop and do other tasks from the comfort of our own homes, saving us time and effort. Additionally, technology has made it possible for us to access information and knowledge more easily than ever before, making it easier for us to learn and grow.  However, technology can also have a negative impact on individuals and society. For example, a lack of communication due to technology can lead to misunderstandings and isolation. It can also lead to addiction, as children and adults alike can become overly obsessed with technology, neglecting other important aspects of their lives. Additionally, technology can have a negative impact on our physical and mental health, as excessive screen time can lead to eye strain, headaches, and other health problems.  In conclusion, technology has brought numerous benefits to our lives, but it also has its drawbacks. It is important for individuals and society as a whole to be aware of these potential consequences and to use technology in a responsible and balanced way. By doing so, we can maximize the benefits of technology while minimizing its negative impact.		1
Hey, ya'll! üòÉ Today, we're gonna talk about this dope quote by Albert Einstein. He said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge." I think he's totally right! üí°  So, why is imagination more important than knowledge? Well, knowledge is like, super helpful for solving problems and stuff, but imagination is like, the spark that makes it all happen! üî• Without imagination, you can't come up with new ideas or think outside the box. Like, have you ever seen a movie or TV show where the characters are like, "Oh no, we're running out of water!" And then they're like, "Hey, let's turn this rock into a water bottle!" üí¶ That's like, totally impossible right? But, if they had imagination, they could be like, "Hey, let's use this laser to cut a hole in the rock and make a water bottle!" üí´ It's like, way more likely to happen if they have imagination!  But, having both imagination and knowledge is super beneficial too! ü§ì Like, if you know a lot about science and stuff, you can use your imagination to come up with new inventions or solutions to problems. Or, if you're an artist, you can use your knowledge of colors and shapes to create really cool art! üé®  And, if you don't have knowledge, you can get in trouble! üò≥ Like, if you're trying to build a rocket ship, but you don't know anything about physics or engineering, it's not gonna fly! üöÄ You need both imagination and knowledge to make it work!  So, there you have it! ü§ì Imagination is more important than knowledge, but having both is super beneficial! üí°üß† Thanks for reading, folks! üëã		1
In Miami, sitting in traffic is simply a part of everyday life, be it during lunch hour or rush hour or be it because of unpredictable accidents or planned road closures. The city is so large that it is oftentimes impossible to walk from point A to point B in a timely manner, and the climate is so unpredictable that is is oftentimes impossible to make such a trek anyways. Could Miami ever be made a carfree community? Considering that these types of communities lower municipal carbon emissions, require better city planning, and encourage people to take advantage of public transportation, Miami, and other cities and suburbs around the United States, should make efforts to reduce private car ownership and use.  Carfree communities are not a theoretical concept. In fact, cities and smaller suburbs have made the move to carfree lifestyles and even been designed with limited car usage in mind all over the world, and even in some parts of the United States. Places like Vauban, Germany and Bogota, Colombia are using this trend to make citizens happier, healthier, and more efficient Rosenthal, Selsky. Alternative transportation, be it walking, bicycling, or taking a bus, is just as viable a way to get around as cars are, and it leads to smarter city planning that accounts for a higher volume of pedestrians walking from their homes to run errands and go shopping and a lessened impact on the environment through fewer greenhouse gas emissions. These things also work together to make for happier citizens. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," says businessman Carlos Arturo about Bogota's citywide carfree day, a program instituted by city officials to encourage limited car usage in 1999 Selsky. A mother of two and media trainer in Vaudan, Germany, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, agrees with Mr. Arturo, saying that life with cars was "always tense" Rosenthal.  It is very understandable that cars would make people nervous. "Cars are responsible for... up to 50 percent" of greenhouse gas emissions in some areas of the United States Rosenthal. Greenhouse gas is notoriously harmful for the environment because it speeds up the process of global warming which can result in higher mean temperatures and things like smog that can bring up very serious health risks. Record high levels of smog in Paris, France last year forced city officials to institute a temporary ban on driving while the city's air was allowed to clear Duffer. Paris typically has a higher amount of pollution in the air than other more ecoconscious European cities, sometimes even a full 67.3 micrograms higher than the level of pollution in London according to Reuters, an international news agency Duffer.  Carfree communities lower carbon emissions tremendously, making smog and other consequences of greenhouse gases much less pressing issues to deal with. In order to reduce the number of cars on the roads, public transportation must be readily accessible and as effictient as possible. This helps city governments manage the amount of carbon they are pumping into the atmosphere by giving them the opportunity to regulate things such as buses, subways, and other forms of metro transit. Public transportation does not only mean actual modes of transportation, though carfree communities must make allowances for the creation and maintainment of things like better sidewalks and bicicyle paths for citizens who elect to use them Rosenthal, Selsky. Congestion would then also be lowered because fewer cars on roadways usually do not result in citytypical, and definitely Miamitypical, traffic jams Duffer.  While it is impossible to assume that Americans will stop using their cars from one day to the next, there are many ways to gradually increase the appeal of carfree lifestyles in commuter cities and suburbs and therefore to reap some of the benefits of diminished popular car usage. In fact, milennials in America have already started this move towards carfree communities Rosenthal. Younger generations are waiting longer to apply for their licenses and buy cars, instead choosing to utilize public transportation, walk, or carpool with friends. Sociologists have also noticed that America has surpassed peak car usage, meaning that Americans no longer drive as much as they once did. The "car culture" that prevails in suburbs and cities through the nation may be on its way into obscurity if the trend continues Rosenthal.		0
Here at NASA the Face on Mars is known to be a natural rock formation. However some people believe that the Face was created by aliens. We are attempting to prove that it is natural.  The Face is a natural rock formation. Evidence such as a picture taken on April 8, 2001 shows that it is nothing more than a mesa which are common in that area of Mars.  The picture was taken with a camera that had a higher resolution than the camera used by the Viking 1 in 1976. The pixels in the image had a closer meter spread at 1.56 meters per pixel to the Viking 1 with 43 meters per pixel causing more of a blur effect.  Others say that the Face is an alien artifact. They say that us at NASA are covering up the fact that there is life on Mars. Another thing they say is that on April 5, 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor took pictures of the Face the alien markings were hidden by the haze due to it being winter on Mars at the time.  The final thing to say on the matter is that the Face is a natural rock formation. The Face was not created by aliens. The pictures prove that it is natural. The fact that us at NASA say that the Face is natural doesn't mean aliens created it. Conspiracy theory disproved.		0
Some people think there is life on other planets and some don't, but in 1976 many people thought NASA had found life on Mars. In 1976 Viking 1 took a photo of mars which looked like a face on the planet's suface. Many believed that this was a sign of life on Mars.  Many of the NASA scientists didn't believe that the face was alien related, but it became a priority for NASA. Soon the Mars Global Surveyor was sent to take more pictures of the face to better find out what it was.  In 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor reached the red planet and took the pictures NASA needed. The pictures it took were more detailed then the ones in 1976. At home, thousands of people waited for the image that the Mar Gobal Surveyor took to reach to web.  The reveal was a natural landform and not alien artifact after all. Still some people didn't belive that  NASA was hiding something. Even though NASA and it's supporters said they would have wanted it to be alien.  Some people still believe NASA is and was hiding something, but we may never know.		0
Dear Mr. Senator,  My name is PROPER_NAME, I'm here to talk to you about keeping the electoral college. The electoral college is a prodess that our founding fathers established. Its said to be in pur decleration as part of the 23rd amendment. For so the district of Columbia is allocated 3 elctors but only for the electoral college. With saying we vote every 4 years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When a citizan votes for their candidate choice they are also voting for the candidate's electors.  There are ups and downs to having the Electoral College. For one the peoples opinion should matter. They were given a gallup poll in which over 60% of the voters prefer a direct election. In 2000 we had our great fiasco which was the biggest election crisis. Eventually the electoral college fixed it. When ever the votes are tied the house of representatives get involved which can change the whole election.  With saying all of this there are 5 reasons to keep our lovely electoral college:  1) Certainty of outcome:  Disputes are possible but very unlikely to happen. There are a total of 538 million votes. So its very easy for there to be a landslide of a vote.  "In 2012's election Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney recieved all the basis."  2) Everyone's President:  One region (south, northeast, etc.) does not have enough votes to elect a president. In saying that no favorite candidate recieves any electoral votes just because he increased his plurality in states that for a fact he can win in.  3) Swing States:  The winner-take-all method shows the candidates that they should pay attention to the toss-up states. These states will pay very close attention to the candidates campaign, showing that they need to focus on their campaigns. The toss-up states are more likely to be the thoughtful voters and the most thoughtful votes should decide the election.  4) Big States:  "A large state gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does"  5) Avoid Run-Off Elections:  The electoral college avoids having an election in which no candidate recieves the majority of the votes.  Thank you,  PROPER_NAME    		0
The electrol college system is an unfair system, people don't have the right to select their own president, they dont have the right to select a president. Because, when people vote they are technically voting for the electors for a candited. That candidate can be a democratic or a republican. In source two it states that electors can choose there opposing candidate. Which declines the the whole voting process. Why do we vote? we vote to select a leader who will defend this coutry and make america a place of oppurtunity. The most important reason why the electrol cllege is unfair because of the " winners it take all" rule.  We as american people cannot choose their own goverment, as it says in source two, that when voters vote they are voting for the canditates electors. Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,¬† then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe¬† chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.  In source two it says that electorals who have been select by the state can choose their opposing candidtade, which is more disatvantgeing to the american people and america's future.¬† for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were "faithless" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america.  In source two and three it states the rule " winner take it all" . The votes the other lose the,¬† winning can take it all, that vote that they take from the losing does not count Because the people really didnt mean to vote for the candidate they don't want or the candidate they dont support, its like your money fell on the floor and someone just took it knowing its yours.  In conclusion,¬† the state senators should eliminate the electoral collge because they count the majorty votes, and don't count other votes that is not popular as the other candidates vote. also because they can decide vote on an canditate they want based on their opinions and beliefs. and lastly because of the winner takes it all system which is bascially taking the losing candidates electoral votes.    		0
When asking for advice, you always want to have more than one persons opinion helping you out. When there is only one opinion that you are asking for, then you have a much lower chance of coming to the best possible solution. If you need advice on something and it seems important enough to ask other people for help, then you want at least two or three people helping you out.  When people need advice, they normally need to think about the problem first. It all depends on the amplitude of the problem, and quickly it needs resolving. Asking for advice can be very difficult to some people, and easier for others, but everybody needs to ask for help at least once in their life. Some problems can easily be figured out on your own, but the more important, difficult, and time consuming the problem is, the more people you want to ask.  Having more than one opinion is the most important thing when you need help with a problem. Whether it is a problem between friends, or a personal delima, you will most likely need help. Only going to one person and asking for their opinion is one of the worst things a person can do, because it may be biased, or difficult to comprehend. Asking at least two or three people for advice is very smart and is highly recommended.  Once you have those opinions, and you cant decide which one to go for, averaging is the way to go. You can take a small part of one possible solution and mix it in with another little part of a second possible solution and so on. Then, you will have crafted the best solution for you and your problem.  So whenever you have a problem, that needs asking for advice, you always want to ask for it. Asking for at least three outside opinions is the smartest way to go. If the problem isn't that big, and you can solve it by youself, that's great. But a problem of higher amplitude needs at least three opinions to average out a possible solution.		0
Studying Venus Despite the Dangers  The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" makes a compelling case that studying Venus is worth pursuing, even with the risks involved. While Venus has some extremely hazardous conditions, the potential scientific rewards outweigh the dangers.   Several key pieces of evidence support this assessment. First, Venus remains one of the least understood planets in our solar system. Due to its dense atmosphere and harsh surface environment, very little is known about Venus' geology, climate history, or potential for life. Robotic missions could gather invaluable data to help solve longstanding mysteries. Additional information about Venus' similarities and differences to Earth may also yield new insights into climate change.   Second, Venus is a prime candidate for comparative planetology due to its similarities in size, mass, and distance from the sun compared to Earth. Studying Venus could provide a window into Earth's geological and atmospheric evolution. Discovering how Venus transformed from a potentially habitable world into the hot inferno it is today may teach us lessons about our own planet's long-term climate stability. Such knowledge has profound implications for understanding and ensuring humanity's future on Earth.  Finally, developing technologies capable of exploring Venus' extreme environment would push the boundaries of engineering and scientific innovation. Overcoming the immense atmospheric pressure, high temperatures, and acidic clouds through robust probe design, new materials, and alternative power sources would prove tremendously beneficial for expanding our reach into the broader solar system and beyond. Meeting the challenge of exploring Venus promises scientific rewards on Venus, Earth, and other worlds.  While Venus exploration poses real and substantial risks, the potential gains in scientific understanding and technological progress more than justify the endeavor according to the article. Mastery of Venus' harsh environment could revolutionize our exploration of the inner solar system and benefit humanity in countless ways. On balance, the author makes a strong case that seeking knowledge and innovation through Venus science is well worth undertaking despite the dangers.		1
Reading someones facial expression may be effective sometimes but that does not mean that they are actually feeling a certain emotion like anger and confusion for example, but they could be feeling extremely happy. In the article, the author stated that Dr. Huang used a picture of Mona Lisa to test the new emotion-recognition software but the software may not be effective because they tested it on a painted photo and not a real living person. Also, da Vinci could have exagerrated Mona Lisas facial expression for the sake of the painting so they may not be accurate.  Using this software in a classroom may not be effective because if a student is making a certain face that does not mean that they are bored or confused, it could just be how their face naturally looks. The software can also mis read their face and even glitch. The use of this program would require the use of a camera through the computer and that is not always safe. Hackers could be trying to hack their computer and steal personal information from the person or even their identity.  In conclusion, this software is not valuable for classroom use because students have other things that they need other then a facial coding system. If the student knows that the camera is active then that could even become a distraction to them so they use of this software is not needed.		0
I bleive that driverless cars should be developed because we are at a new age in time and we need to upgrade. To start upgrading the world lets strat with new technology in the cars that we drive.  In the world we live in today we drive ordinary cars that were made for ordinary people. Lest beging looking at the companies that are making the cars, are they great at manufacturing, is their reputation high, and are they expected to make the world a better place, Yes. Many futurists said that in order to have smarter cars we would have to have smart roads as well.  IN the 1950s, GM created an test track with an electric cable that sent radio signals to a recieverat the front of the car. Others have tried this, but they had a different mathod. Engineers at barkeley used magnets with alternating polarity, such as sensors. we ues sensors today to give human like senses to an object. I believe the number one reason for putting sensors on an car was to see if they could make a car drive as if a real human was in side controlling it.  If the car was always driving by itslef wouldn't the driver get very board and lose focus off while in traffic. Yes they would, which is why they have decided to put in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays for drivers that get distracted easily. These heads-up specialties are a great use of our technology because we have created them to help us with our new technology, we are a technology reliant community. 		0
I don't think it is a good idea to have driverless cars because one day you may be driving and your car is driverless but it is an on coming car coming toward you and you don't have control of the car and the car might not sense when another car is coming toward it and it may and can cause a wreck. Others may agree to have driverless cars but I don't think it is a good idea to have driverless cars it may be safe to other but it is not safe to me because I wouldn't want to have a wreck driving in a driverless car. It is good to have motion sensored cameras on the back and front of some vehicles but it is not good to have a car that parks itself because you could maybe put the car in to driverless mode it may cause a wreck or crash while the car is parking or driving on it's own. it is not good to have antilock brakes either bc you could be on your way to work and your coming to a yellow light that is turning red you may not be paying attention and not have your seatbelt on and the car just brakes on it's own it could cause serious and major injuries to you or anyone else who may be in the car with you.		0
---  Dear Senator,  I am writing to express my strong opposition to any efforts to replace the Electoral College with a popular vote system for the US presidential elections. Despite the criticism leveled at the Electoral College in recent years, I believe that it is a crucial part of our democratic process that must be preserved.  First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures that all states have a say in the election outcome, regardless of their population size. This is particularly important because it prevents highly populated states like California and New York from dominating the election and effectively rendering the smaller states irrelevant. By giving each state a set number of electoral votes based on its population, the Electoral College ensures that every vote counts and that no state is left out of the decision-making process.  Furthermore, the Electoral College has a long history in the United States, dating back to the founding of the country. It was put in place by the framers of the Constitution as a way to balance the interests of the individual states with the needs of the nation as a whole. It has served us well for over two centuries and has never been the cause of any major electoral issues or controversies.  Critics of the Electoral College argue that it is undemocratic because it is possible for a candidate to become president without winning the popular vote. This is a legitimate concern, but it is important to remember that the Electoral College was never intended to be a direct representation of the popular will. Instead, it was designed to ensure that the person elected to the presidency had broad-based support across the country, not just in a few highly populated states.  In conclusion, I urge you to support the continued use of the Electoral College in US presidential elections. While it may not be perfect, it provides a fair and balanced way of electing our president that has served us well for over 200 years. Thank you for your consideration.  Sincerely,  A concerned constituent.		1
 The facial action coding system is a method of interpreting micro-expressions that convey different emotions and facial movements. Facial action coding (FAC) is a standardized system for analyzing expressions and identifying individual components of facial movements. The system was developed by Paul Ekman and his colleagues in the 1960s, and it has since become widely used in fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and social sciences. In this essay, we will discuss the basics of the facial action coding system, its components, and its applications.  The facial action coding system is based on the idea that there are different muscles in the face that are responsible for different expressions. These muscles are active independently, and their activity can be detected by specific sensors that track movement in the face. The system is thus able to identify individual components of facial movements, such as muscle contractions, asymmetry, and blinking. These individual components are then used to infer complex emotions and behaviors, such as happiness, anger, sadness, and fear.  The facial action coding system consists of several components that work together to decode facial expressions. First and foremost, the system uses sensor data to track facial movements, such as muscle activity and facial landmarks. This data is then analyzed to identify individual components of facial movements, such as eyebrow movements, eye blinks, nose movements, and facial muscle contractions. These components are then combined to form a complete expression, which is then used to infer emotional state and behavioral intentions.  The facial action coding system has a wide range of applications in various fields. In psychology, it is used to study the mechanisms of emotion and behavior, as well as to identify abnormalities in facial expression in individuals with emotional disorders. In neuroscience, FAC is used to study the neural circuits involved in facial expression, and to investigate the integration of sensory and motor information in the brain. In social sciences, FAC is used to study interpersonal relationships, aggression, and deception. By analyzing facial expressions, researchers can gain valuable insights into the cognitive and emotional processes involved in these phenomena.  In conclusion, the facial action coding system is a powerful tool for understanding facial expressions and inferring emotional state and behavioral intentions. The system consists of several components that work together to track facial movements and decode expressions, and it has a wide range of applications in various fields. By analyzing facial expressions, researchers can gain valuable insights into the mechanisms of emotion and behavior, and develop interventions to help individuals regulate their emotions and improve their relationships.		1
Dear Principle,  This is a very difficult choice for you to make. The first policy is what I think is the better option. Yes i understand that cell phones can be a distraction to students and teachers, but in the halls it would not distract anybody. I think that because students should be able to have cell phones to school. They should be aloud to have them during free times because they would not be a distraction to anybody because they have nothing to focus on well other than what they are doing. Students would be much happier in the halls if you allowed them to have cell phones.  Another reason would have to be if a student had to get a-hold of there parents because of an emergency, but were not able to have phones.  There are many kids with health problems. What if some kid had to take medicine and forgot to? There are many problems that could happen to a student and they would need to talk to their parents but were not able to get the help they needed. Yes you could get help from a teacher, but if it is something that a teacher did not know what to do, you could have a lot of problems there. So I hope that i have persuaded you enough to allow students to have cell phones during there free time at school. So as you can see, there are many reasons why a student should be able to have cell phones.      		0
I support the developement of driverless/autonomous cars. Cars have been driven by human drivers so far and accidents are frequent and often violent. If we had autonomous cars, we could almost completely eliminate human error altogether. Autonomous cars would also be more efficient.  Driverless cars would replace they human driver, who can be sometimes angered by other drivers, distracted by passengers, or get easily lost in new places, with a more logic minded computer. An autonomous car would be safer than a human driven car because a computer program cannot be distracted by its passengers or get angry at someone's poor driving because a computer doesn't think emotionally, but rather logically, making the computer driver safer. Google has been test driving partial-autonomous cars in certain conditions for 7 years and has so far had no crashes.  Autonomous cars would not only be a safer alternative to human driving, but a more fuel eficient, and therefore, greener alternative. According to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, autonomous cars would be twice as fuel efficient as today's taxis and buses. With more fuel efficient cars, pollution due to carbon dioxide emmisions will drastically decrease. Fuel efficient cars also help the American economy because if cars are using half as much gasoline, then we only have to import half as much oil, which will save us money as a country.  Autonomous vehicles would save lives and money. With a computer at the wheel, cars could find the most efficient and safe route to almost any destination. Greenhouse gas emmisions would be reduced, therefore making our planet a better place to be.		0
 My mom is someone who has shared wisdom and experience with me. She has shown me her experiences and taught me about life.  My mom has taught me about the importance of perseverance and never giving up. She has shown me that life can be hard and challenging, but with determination and hard work, anything is possible. She has taught me to believe in myself and to never give up on my dreams.  My mom has also taught me about the importance of taking care of myself and my health. She has shown me how to eat healthy, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep. She has taught me that taking care of my body is essential for my overall well-being.  My mom has also taught me about the importance of family and relationships. She has shown me how to communicate effectively, listen actively, and resolve conflicts peacefully. She has taught me to value the relationships in my life and to always be there for my family and friends.  In conclusion, my mom is a wonderful role model who has taught me so much about life. She has shown me the importance of perseverance, self-care, and relationships. I am grateful for all the wisdom and experience she has shared with me and will continue to learn from her in the future.		1
 Thomas Jefferson once wrote, "Determine never to be idle. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." This quote suggests that by consistently working towards our goals, we can achieve great things. I believe that when we put in the effort and dedication towards our interests, we can accomplish our goals.  When setting goals, it's important to have a clear vision of what we want to achieve in the future. In order to accomplish our goals, we must remain focused and committed until we reach them. One way to achieve this is by participating in programs or small groups that can help us reach our goals. By consistently practicing what we're interested in, we can improve our skills and increase our chances of success.  It's important to stay positive and optimistic when working towards our goals. We should always try something new and step outside of our comfort zone. We never know what we're capable of until we try. Additionally, it's important to be patient and persistent in our efforts. Accomplishing our goals may not happen overnight, but with consistent effort and dedication, we can achieve them.  Many times, we don't accomplish anything because we're not trying or we're not fully committed to our goals. However, even if we're not making progress, it's important to keep trying and to be open to new opportunities. If one approach isn't working, we can try something else that's new or challenging. Accomplishing our goals is not just about achieving short-term or long-term objectives, but it's also about pushing ourselves to be the best version of ourselves.  In conclusion, by consistently working towards our goals, we can achieve great things. By focusing on our interests, practicing consistently, and remaining positive and optimistic, we can accomplish our goals and feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. So, let's never be idle and always strive to do our best.		1
Dear Principal,  I think that students should perform community service. Some students may think that community service is a waste of time, but they are wrong. It's not a waste of time. It can actually benefit you in the future. Community service can help you get into college. Colleges are sometimes picky about who they want in their college and they usually pick the one with a lot of community service hours because they know that the ones who are doing community service are students who are good and want to help the community. That is one of the thing that a college on a student's application.  Also, there are community service that can either be enjoyable and it can help you with your career path or help you find one. I got two friends who are doing Civil Air Patrol for their community service hour. They find it very enjoyable and it help them with their career path. I believe that Civil Air Patrol also give out scholarship for people.  As you can see principal, students should perform community service. It's not a waste of time like some of them believe. It could get them into college and give a bright future to look forward to. Isn't it your and the teacher job to help guide the students to have a good education and a shining future for all the future generations.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
As a way to start I'm going to ask a question. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? My answer is very simple and I'll explain why. My answer is no of course not. In the next few paragraphs I'll tell you why students wouldn't benefit from online courses.  Firstly, students would spend most of their time at home playing video games ,taking naps,etc. By the time they do the online course sure the take notes,pay attention,do the work needed to do,but the online course dose¬†not¬†last a whole 2 hours or hour and a half like in school classes do. In my uncles experience in high school, he said that he would always spend half the day eating,sleeping,or playing video games,while the other half was either working or hanging out with friends. My uncle didn't worry about his online course because he thought they don't take long so he can do it whenever he can. Consequently, he didn't graduate on time and had to take the class in school during the summer.  Secondly, some students won't get the necessary knowledge they need. A 45 minute online course isn't enough time to explain all type of data that is needed in order to pass the class. Most online courses, if you don't take the class in school, are required for you to graduate in high school. In my experience, I take Personal Finance and the website where we learn the information is called Virtual Business. Each topic lasts only for 45 minutes or less. Although it is still a long time, it's still not enough to inform us about the topic/class.  Lastly, in many schools it is not recommended to take online courses. For instance,in Generic_School a student counselor told a friend of mine that unless he was responsible and could be able to keep up with the course it was a great opportunity. In a similar case I also talked to my counselor but this time the school was Generic_School. In my situation I was told that this wasn't a great idea to take an online course since I can't manage my time well and it was a risk I was willing to take. Unfortunately, I wish I hadn't taken the class because now I am at risk at not graduating on time.  In conclusion, I do not believe that students would benefit attending classes from home because most of the time the student won't get their work done or not have time. In addition, students could have an instructor helping them druing school while in online courses you have to figure it out yourself. Sometimes online courses have their benefits but most of the time they don't.		0
Cell phones, almost every teen owns one. A cell phone is a way of communication with friends, family and business associates. Now, should students be aloud to use cell phones during free times and lunch periods? I think so.  Most schools do not allow cell phones to be used during free times and lunch periods. But, not being able to used cell phones at all would make someone more tempted to use it during class. Giving a student the privilege of being able to use their cell phones during free time and lunch periods could help lower the amount of "phone users in class." If a student is caught in class using their phone the teacher could simply take away the privilege for the student to have use of the phone during free time and lunch periods and, they could also remove the phone from the students possession. And, no student wants to have their phone taken away; therefore the student will not have the phone out during class.  The students could simply turn off their phone after these approved times for use. This will also help tech the students that if you do not follow rules, then there will be consequences. This will help the student prepare for later in life. This will teach students to follow rules and help keep themselves out of trouble. There are students who never use their phones during class, and these students should not have to be punished because some students can not keep their cell phones turned off. This idea might just be a very good one.  If the idea of letting students use cell phones during free times and lunch periods does prove to be a fail, then the school could always just go back to no cell phones on at school rule. There is no harm at just giving this idea a chance. The idea might just be very successful. Just because there is a change made to the way things are, that does not mean they must stay that way forever. All they have to do is change the rules back to the way they were.  So, take a chance see if letting students use cell phones during free times and lunch periods is a good idea. Who knows it might be a very good choice.                  		0
Dear Principle such and such,  It has come to my notice that you are considering that all kids who go to school should have to do community service and I strongly disagree because it should be a volunteer thing if you want to do it or not .Some kids don't want to do it and it would just make them angry if they had to miss a day off school to do work or leave there friends early to go clean up some street they would refuse to do it and take punishment rather then clean up the environment.  But I'm not saying you should not do it but make it a volunteer thing were you are committing to it and have to show up unless prearranged with you or who ever is in charge of it.  All I'm doing is voicing y opinion with you and getting my advice on the matter of what you are thinking of.  thank you, inmate 123		0

Advances in science and medicine have also been made possible with innovative technologies, leading to better treatments for fatal illnesses.   Overall, it is clear that technology has played a major role in improving people's lives. By making job searches easier, helping to connect with others, and aiding in the military and in science, technology has drastically changed how people live.		1
 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a tool used in psychology and psychology to study the micro-expressions that occur on a person's face. These micro-expressions are involuntary movements that occur in response to emotions and can provide insight into a person's true feelings. FACS is a standardized system of measuring these facial movements, making it a valuable tool for studying emotions and their effects on individuals.  FACS is based on the idea that the human face is a complex system of muscles that are capable of producing a wide range of expressions. These expressions can be both conscious and unconscious, and FACS is designed to measure the involuntary movements that occur in response to emotions. By analyzing these facial movements, researchers can gain a better understanding of how emotions are expressed and how they affect individuals.  FACS uses a standardized system of coding facial movements to capture the subtle changes that occur in a person's face. The system is based on six basic facial movements, which are then broken down into smaller, more specific codes. These codes can be used to quantify the intensity and duration of a particular emotion, making it easier to compare different experiences and study the effects of different stimuli on individuals.  One of the most common applications of FACS is in emotion research. By analyzing facial expressions, researchers can gain insights into how individuals respond to different stimuli and emotions. For example, studies have shown that people respond differently to unpleasant stimuli, such as pain or stress, than they do to pleasant stimuli, such as pleasure or reward. FACS can be used to measure these differences and provide a more objective understanding of these emotional responses.  FACS is also used in clinical psychology and mental health research. It can be used to diagnose and treat a range of mental health conditions, such as anxiety or depression. By analyzing facial expressions, therapists can identify patterns of behavior and emotion that may be indicative of a particular condition and tailor their treatment accordingly.  Overall, FACS is a valuable tool for studying emotions and their effects on individuals. It provides a standardized system for measuring facial movements, making it easy to compare different studies and analyze the effects of different stimuli on individuals. The system has a wide range of applications, from emotion research to clinical psychology and mental health research, and it is likely to continue to evolve and improve in the coming years.		1
Most students that are in summer break have other things to do over the break which in this case doesn't work for them. This is why they should implement a student designed project. The project would work for students during the break since the students can set the project on how long or what time it is. A student designed project would benefit the students in creativity and a overall better and fun learning experience. The student designed project helps with the time schedule and making sure to keep the students in check with their education and overall learning experience.  Usually the teacher designed project would take weeks to finish and students would cram it back to the last week of summer break and finish it then. Which causes more stress on the mind and that they have a deadline due on there break. As an example, I had a summer project in to do in sophomore year and I was planning to volunteer at a animal shelter for the rest of the summer. But in my case I get a big fat summer project which now I have to do in the least amount of time I have. This is why we should make the deadline pushed back so the students that don't have time to work on the project can finish the project in time and not get a bad grade for the first quarter of there class.  Students should get to brainstorm and idea of what the project they would want. That could be anything that works with the students. This idea would bring out more fun and wanting to do the project to the students and lets the mind work while not being stressed out. If you love doing something for you're work, then its not really work. The project becomes enjoyable and not time consuming.  Some key facts from the world education system is the Poland is the number one in education. The reason being is that they get to brainstorm projects over the summer and make something up by themselves and it works. They also do this during the school and they have no homework at all.  This is why we should make not just having student designed projects over the break but have them during the school year. This will benefit students in a whole lot ways that bring out the thinking and new ideas that may benefit the school or someone or something that needs it. We should be pushing forward new ideas that may help society in the long run. It could be anyone that could have a great idea.  In conclusion, student designed projects benefit the students and society which in turn makes you feel proud that you did something productive over the summer that meant something to you and others. Most people don't do anything over the summer which is sad because this a chance to do something that benefits them and they have all the free time in the world.¬†   ¬†		0
 The Advancement of Technology and Its Impact on Humanity  Technology has been advancing at a rapid pace over the years, with smartphones and social media platforms being some of the most popular devices used by people worldwide. While technology has brought many benefits to humanity, it has also had a significant impact on the way people interact with each other and the world around them.  One of the most significant impacts of technology is the way it has changed the way people consume information. With the internet, people can access vast amounts of information in a matter of seconds, making it easier to learn and stay informed about the world around them. However, this has also led to a decline in the reading of physical books and a loss of interest in traditional forms of storytelling.  In my opinion, technology has been both a blessing and a curse for humanity. While it has made life easier and more convenient in many ways, it has also led to a decline in face-to-face interactions and a loss of focus on the present moment. People are more likely to spend their time on social media platforms and other digital devices than engaging in meaningful conversations with others.  Despite these challenges, it is important to recognize the many benefits that technology has brought to humanity. It has revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and access information, making it easier to connect with people from all over the world and to learn about different cultures and perspectives. Additionally, technology has the potential to help us care for the planet and address some of the most pressing issues facing our world today.  In conclusion, while technology has had a significant impact on humanity, it is important to use it responsibly and to recognize its many benefits. By doing so, we can ensure that technology continues to be a force for good in our world.		1
 The electoral college is a system that determines the president of the United States. It was established in the Constitution in 1787 and is based on a process in which the president is elected by a majority of the electors in the Electoral College, rather than directly by the people. The purpose of the essay is to explore whether the electoral college system works and whether it is necessary to continue to use it.  One argument in favor of the electoral college is the idea that it represents the interests of the entire country, rather than just those in highly populated areas. Electors are chosen by state and local officials and parties, not by the people themselves. This means that the electors are more likely to represent the views of the people in smaller and less populated states, where their voices may be otherwise drowned out by the larger states.  Another argument is that the electoral college provides a level of stability to the presidential election process. Because the president is elected by a majority of electors, rather than a simple majority of the popular vote, it is much more difficult for a candidate to win the presidency by winning only in highly populated areas. This can prevent extreme candidates who are popular only in certain regions of the country from becoming president and potentially dividing the country.  However, there are also arguments against the electoral college. One argument is that it can lead to the candidate ignoring certain parts of the country in favor of others. Since candidates only need to win enough electoral votes to become president, they may focus their efforts on states with a high number of electors, rather than on states with lower numbers of electors but with a large number of people. This can lead to the candidate ignoring the needs and concerns of certain groups of people.  Another argument is that the electoral college can lead to the candidate being chosen by a group of individuals with different interests and values than those of the general population. Electors are often chosen by state and local officials and parties, and they may not be representative of the general population in their area. This can lead to the president being chosen by a group of people who may not have the best interests of the country at heart.  In conclusion, the electoral college system is a controversial one. Those who support it argue that it represents the interests of the entire country and provides a level of stability to the presidential election process. Those who oppose it argue that it can lead to the candidate ignoring certain parts of the country and can result in the president being chosen by a group of individuals with different interests and values than those of the general population. Ultimately, the question of whether the electoral college works is a complex one and will likely continue to be debated in the future.		1
The author is supporting this idea very well. Because in the text he is giving many reason on how Venus is our sister planet but a lot hoter than us. In the text they said, "On the planet's surface tempertures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the armospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet.  They came up with so many ideas to go to Venus and take test samples. Example, "Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Vensian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms." It's going to be a very dangerous job to do on the planet. Because they cannot take samples from a distance, they have to take samples on the planet.  It's going to be one of the biggest challenges they will ever have, but if they want to know what it's like to be on Venus, they're going to do it for everyone and the people in this world. 		0
Should Drivers Use Cellphones While Driving?  Cell Phones have become a prominent part of most peoples lives in this contemporary era. Smartphone ownership is growing rapidly around the world. In addition, the worlds population is 7.6 billion with an estimated 1.4 billion cars on the road. That is a vast eighteen percent of the population. This leads to the question, should drivers be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? I feel as though you should not touch your phone while operating a vehicle. A person is twenty-three times more likely to have a motor vehicle crash while texting and driving.  It maybe argued that people need their phones in dire emergencies. This is where the campaign "It can wait" comes in and other programs to promote wireless usage (ex. Bluetooth). Thus, ceasing any hands-on phone activity while operating the vehicle. Bluetooth wireless makes things more convenient for vehicle users. Calls, music listening, and more can be accessed using Bluetooth.  When texting and driving, your focus is mostly on your phone. Your focus is supposed to be fully on the road. Not only is there traffic, but you also must look out for pedestrians. You must be aware so that you can be able to react quickly to pedestrians that aren't aware and potential accidents (due to poor judgement of other drivers). Knowing and keeping track of your speed and the speed limit is also crucial. You cannot do as listed above when fully submerged in your phone.  Additionally, laws are being passed to stop driving and using a cellphone in any capacity of a vehicle. If seen doing so, you will get a ticket. As of July 1st, 2019, this law was put in place in Georgia. You would also receive a moving violation. Moving violations affect auto insurance. While cellphones are very convenient, we must be able to articulate when and where to use them.  We are aware of places where they are prohibited (e. g.: court rooms, airplanes, movies) therefore it will take some getting used to not being on your phone at all while driving. It is not impossible, though. We can still receive phone calls, especially those very important ones, of course. As mentioned before, the Bluetooth may be hooked up to your car, therefore one may talk wirelessly whilst driving. The conversation may be heard via speakers in the car. In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It can always wait.  Works Cited 1.)

Nobody likes school, it's a hassle, whether it's waking up at the crack of dawn and having to use your brain quickly after, or having to sit in a classroom and take in knowledge for 7 hours. Whatever it is, students just are not drawn to the idea. Plenty of kids, in a heartbeat, would love to have the chance to take online classes.¬†Online schools allow for students to be able to learn in a comfortable and familiar setting while still being able to control their own time management.  Taking online classes are not as easy at they might seem. Parents are hesitant to allow their child to attend online classes because they feel as if their child will become unfocused in such a comfortable setting without any supervision to get them back on track. Also, classes online cost a lot of money parents do not want to spend when their student could happily attend school and get an education in person. Students can also become unmotivated and feel as though they dont have to try as hard with online classes as an effect of no teacher or other students to influence their learning.  While all of that is very true, online classes are just an easier option. Waking up early to catch a bus to school, what if you wake up late and miss the bus? Most kids dont have a parent at home or any reliable ride to drive them to school. So they just miss a whole day of school? With online classes you dont deal with problems like that, you wake up anytime you want and are able to attend the classes anytime you would like in the own comforts of your house. Online classes are taken on a computer, no fancy device or specific-expensive computer. It is a quick and easy way to learn and that students would enjoy rather than going and attending an actual school.  Attending school can be hard that is why being able to take classes without having to leave their room is all the more reasons to take these classes. If a student is being bullied at school or is having difficulties in school with teachers or students, taking classes at home in their own space is a relief to them. They are able to continue their studies without having to worry about other things that may distract them from learning or that may put them into a dismal feeling about school. That allows them to develop a more positive emotions towards learning and studying in general. Developing a comfortable relationship with peers or teachers and having to take in knowledge at the same time can take a long time and can be quite stressful. While being in their house allows them to eliminate the factor of dealing with teachers and students, it allows them to learn in a comfortable setting which would be good for people with social anxiety. Students become more comfortable in their own house which allows them to think positively on learning and gets them to focus more on learning while in a familiar place.  Lastly, students are able to control their own time management. Unlike school where they have to sit in a classroom for 7 hours learning, besides getting from class-to-class and eating lunch, there are no breaks for students to recharge. With classes online they are able to space out their classes and even take breaks in between¬†to help them stay motivated and focused. They are additionally able to wake up whenever they want which students who attend schools do not have the privilege to have. After staying up late from doing homework that they got after their 7 hour day at school, they have to wake up early to attend school all over again. That causes students to come to school tired and not being able to learn. Online class gives them the privilege to get a good nights rest so that in the morning they are all ready to learn.  Students would benefit by taking classes at home because everything is by their own control. They are able to control their own time and being able to learn while being in a well known environment. Students are also able to learn better and form a positive experience with taking classes.¬†		0
 The Face on Mars has been a topic of fascination and intrigue for decades. It is a large, dark circle that appears on the surface of the planet as seen from above. There are many theories about what the Face on Mars is and what it might mean.  One theory is that the Face on Mars is a massive impact crater. When meteorites or other space debris collide with a planet, they can create a huge impression in the surface. The Face on Mars is located in the Tharsis region of Mars, which is known for its volcanic activity and high altitudes, and may be a result of a massive impact.  Another theory is that the Face on Mars is a remnant of an ancient Martian civilization. Some scientists believe that Mars once had a thick atmosphere, with conditions that could have supported life. If this is true, then it  s possible that the Face on Mars was created by the actions of an ancient civilization that inhabited the planet.  Some scientists have even suggested that the Face on Mars could be a fossilized organism or an alien life form. There is a lot of evidence that supports this theory, including the fact that the Face on Mars is located near several other geological formations, including a mountain and a canyon, that could have provided the ideal conditions for life to thrive.  Despite all of the theories and speculation, no one knows for sure what the Face on Mars is or what it means. However, it continues to be a source of fascination for scientists and researchers. They are constantly studying the planet and its features in the hopes of uncovering the secrets		1
Summer is the time of the year every student looks forward to. Apart from socializing with friends, enjoying the fresh air, and participating in outdoor activities, students have the chance to assure their learning abilities through summer projects. Summer projects should be school-designed because it allows flexibility, it develops leadership skills, and it increases creativity.  Student-designed projects allows flexibility during summer break. Generic_City's lifeguard program was very successful during the summer due to lifeguard availability. Being a lifeguard is a common job students pursue during the summer. Not only does it allow students to gain profit at a young age, but it also requires a high level of maturity and responsibility. Because it requires specific training and dedication, students must have the time to complete every task that is given. Having a student-designed summer project allows students to set their own study time instead of following a specific schedule that could intervene with working hours.  In 2019, the Pied-Piper Theater Association¬†successfully rehearsed their summer musical: West Side Story The Musical, due to the availability and hard work¬†of all actors. In West Side Story, the combination of performing arts and music are combined as one to produce an extraordinary musical. Rehearsing a musical is no simple task: lines must be memorized, choreography and blocking must be pristine, and every actor must be present on opening show days. A student-designed project over the summer can help students complete their required work in an flexible manner while still completing personal activities.  Developing leadership skills for the future are offered through student-designed projects. Designing their own promotional plans, students from the Technology Student Association were able to pursue college business majors. The Technology Student Association allowed students to be completely in charge of their own work to get a sense of the leadership that is needed in many technology and business fields today. As a result, the ones who were consistent in their work and created their own designs were the most successful at the TSA regional competitions. Student-designed projects allows students to be in control and have the opportunity to manage work responsibly. Even though having a teacher-designed project can help in follow instructions and meeting deadlines, being ones own boss opens doors to many leadership opportunities to excel in the work field, and in ones personal life.  Panera Bread employees that have shown leadership development have moved to higher job positions. In the food industry, like most jobs, employees must start off with a lower position and must enhance their abilities in order to move up to a higher position. For example, in Panera Bread, most new employees start of working as a cashier, dining room attendant, or produce worker; these minor positions prepare the employee with basic skills and prepare them for future duties. Later, when more experience is gained, employees move up to trainer or manager assistant. Similarly, student-designed projects help students learn to be self-sufficient and lead one another to success. As a result, future generations are encouraged to do the same.  Student-designed projects allow students to show their full potential through creativity. Generic_School economics and finance teacher, allowed students to create their own budget plan presentation, discarding the teacher rubric that was given, to show their creativity. A typical power point¬†presentation a high school teacher assigns has basic requirements: a specific number of slides, easily-applicable pictures, and bullet point¬†information. However, when given the chance, students embraced their creativity outside the classroom environment and created sideshows, music videos, and drawings that still portrayed the same important idea any basic power point would for the assignment. As a result, the students who got lower scores on previous power points, increased their grade tremendously. Unlike teacher-designed projects, Student-designed projects has many varieties a student can choose from; students don't have to limit their potential to strict instructions. Instead, they have numerous ways to complete any assignment feeling more confident and fulfilled.  Generic_School International Talent Show showed how students from different cultures expressed their love and appreciation through creative attire. The purpose of International Night is to unite students together to celebrate their culture as one. For example, students from Peru dressed up with typical Peruvian dresses and hats and danced salsa, while students from France wore more formal attire and simply help their flag up proudly. Every student had a unique way of showing their performance to the crowd; the teachers had very little input on exactly how the students should perform and let their creativity run free. Even though a summer project doesn't exactly involve performing to a large crowd, students have the chance to show their creative ideas and opinions without any limitations.  In conclusion, students have a unique way of showing their academic and social potential to the world. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows flexibility, it develops leadership skills, and it increases creativity.

I don't care what google does for driverless cars, I think they may be good for a small town such as Berne, but there are a lot of cons to this whole issue. I think it would be fun to have cars we don't have to drive ourselfs but an issue with that is what if we do get into an accidnet in a bigger city. I'm nuetral on this topic because they aren't truly driverless ars if they still need a driver.  I don't particularly care if we get driverless cars or not. Kids have been waiting to get their license for generations, if we get driverless cars does that mean the age of legal driving decreases? Would children be able to drive, if so that's not too fair. Those kids would miss out on learning these skills to drive that everyone else had to learn.  I don't know if driverless cars is a bad thing or a good thing, but I'd rather stick to my littly chevy car. I say this becasue, I have to stay awake for either car. If i were to have a car that drove itself, I'd sleep in the back of my car until i had reached my desination. But if I'm needed to navigate through rough areas then I'd rather drive the whole way to my desination. I understand that these cars would give you a form of entertainment to keep you occupied while in the vehicle, but I'd fall asleep and wouldn't wake up when the car needed me.  It is handy though, a car like this, but one would have to wonder the cost of a car like that. Probably something none of us could afford to buy. But it would be nice to not have to worry about other cars, although when you come to a stop, although it has sensros on the car, does it sense the other driverless car? What if that car in the other line isnt't driverless and the driver decided to wave you along and let you go first, what would the car do? Does it truly function probably at an intersection?  I dont particularly care about this kind of car, I learned how to drive and I'd rather just do that. Although thus driverless car sounds safer, I'm sure it would make less mistakes than I do, I don't quite trust it. Reason being is the issue with other drivers at an intersection, or the age of legal driving, then the not paying attention part of sitting in that car. If your car is navigating itself, do you really trust where you're going?   		0
What Does it Look Look Like to You  The "Face on Mars" is just a landform. Like many other NASA scientist i do not beleive that it was an made by ancient civilazations of aliens. The pictures that we have taken from the planet Mars first indicated a type of face. But now that with our newer technology we've seen that it is just a mesa or butte. NASA has even provided real photos taken on the Mars. But still, many disagree that it is simply just a landform.  Nasa sending out the Viking 1 and bringing back that picture has made a big impact on NASA. Alot of scientist did not beleive that it was a face. But "the Face on Mars" has become a pop icon. This "Face on Mars" starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout linesfor 25 years. But NASA scientist were still a bit doubtfull.  In 1998 NASA felt that it was important to tax payers to see the for sure if the "the Face on Mars" was really a face at all. When Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural alndform. So all these people believed that it was a face but it actually turned out, from real pictures taken, to be a landform.  But still not evryone was content with that. The "Face on Mars" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998-a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera that took the last picture of the "Face on Mars" had to peer through wispy clouds to see the "Face". So in April 8, 2001-a clodless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. And once again the even more advanced picture of the "Face on Mars" looked like a mesa or a butte.  Now some people will say that NASA is trying to cover up something, that they are hiding something from the public. Others say that NASA doesn't want people to know if there are aliens out there. But what people lack in that accusation is the fact that if NASA would've discovered aliens, it would be one of the most popular and profitable organizations on Earth. NASA trying to verify, by spending millions of dollars on global surveyors to take pictures of Cydonia, if the "Face on Mars" is really a face is not them trying to hide anything. In fact its NASA trying to satisfy the public in best ways they can. And people even say that the pictures arent good enough to tell for sure. NASA's surveyor's camera pixel in 2001 had a span of 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.  So in conclusion, even though you dont beleive that its a natural landform, and i understand why, facts and real photos beg to differ that idea of a face on the Mars. All the times NASA has sent out surveyors to bring pictures to the public, the public just gave them garbage. So honestly all i can say is that all the facts and pictures that NASA has provided us with to understand the face or landform is for a reason. And thats so people can see and decide for themselves wheather it a face or a landform. But really if a scientist and an entire corporation of intellegiant scientist with high degrees say its a landform, then that they're aren't going to lie to an entire planet of people.             		0
Dear Principal Johnson,   I am writing to you regarding the school's cell phone policy that is currently under review. Of the two options being considered, I believe Policy 1 is the better choice for our school. Allowing students to bring phones but requiring them to be turned off during class time strikes the right balance.  One of the main advantages of Policy 1 is that it recognizes students live in a technology-driven world and often use their phones to communicate with friends and family outside of school. An outright ban under Policy 2 may seem overly strict to many students. Policy 1 still maintains the focus on learning during academic periods by having phones off, while permitting responsible phone use during free times.  Policy 1 also empowers students to make good decisions. If students are treated as mature individuals capable of following the turned-off requirement, most will rise to meet that expectation. An outright ban may undermine our goal of cultivating independent, self-disciplined learners. Policy 1 sets clear rules but also gives students freedom, teaching them how to conduct themselves appropriately in different contexts.   For these key reasons, I believe Policy 1 is the better approach for our school. It accommodates technology use in a measured way that still prioritizes academics. Policy 1 also encourages personal responsibility through structured freedom, rather than an all-out ban. I hope you will carefully consider implementing this policy. Please let me know if any part of my perspective can be clarified or expanded upon.   Thank you for your consideration.  Sincerely, [Your name]		1
The Face on mars is just a natural landform. any scientist believe it was created by aliens, but i feel like its just a normal landform. To prove that it is a natural landform and not built by position of mars, erosion, and time change.  The position of the planet can also be the reason why the rock looks like a face. In paragraph 2, it says that the rock did have shadoes that could give anillusion of eyes, mouth, and a nose. In paragraph 8, It gives the season which caused clouds. Clouds are one of many reasons that causes shadows. These clouds could of ben in a cerrtain position that gave "The Face" illusions.  A possible explanation that the face is just a natural landform is erosion. In paragraph 8, it states that . Mars experienced a vey cloudy time. As known that clouds can form rain and/or wind which can be used to wither ddown rocks. Wind on Mars could be harsh and putting a lot of pressure aganst a giant rock causeing it to make indents. These indents can be seen as eyes, mouth, or even a nose.  As you see in the pictures that were taken by Viking 1, over the time period the face began to dissapear. In the pre-story,  "The Face" was hand made by an alien then wouldn't you think that they would keep itin good condition . Instead "The Face"  deformed over the time. Just like on earth, rocks break down over time.  There are many factors that can be said to prove that "The Face" is just a natural landform.  Even an website like the one in paragraph 7, can state that it was just a nateral landform. With enough evidence you can prove that it was indeed a natural landform.              		0
 Car-free cities have become an increasingly popular trend in recent years, as concerns about air pollution, traffic congestion, and health benefits grow. The idea of limiting car usage in cities has many advantages, including making cities greener, safer, and healthier.  One of the main advantages of car-free cities is the reduction in air pollution. Many cities are located in areas with high levels of smog or other air pollution, and the increased number of cars on the road only makes the problem worse. By reducing the number of cars in the city, air pollution levels can be significantly reduced, making the city a healthier place to live.  Another advantage of car-free cities is that they tend to be much safer. Car accidents are one of the leading causes of death in many countries, and they are especially common in densely populated areas like cities. By reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities can significantly reduce the risk of accidents, making the city safer for its inhabitants.  Car-free cities also tend to be much more sustainable, as they rely more on alternative modes of transportation like walking, biking, or public transportation. These alternative modes of transportation are much more eco-friendly than cars, producing fewer emissions and reducing the city's carbon footprint.  Finally, car-free cities can also improve the quality of life for their inhabitants. By reducing congestion on the road, people can spend more time participating in activities outside their homes, like sports, hobbies, or simply spending time with family and friends. This can lead to a healthier, happier population, as the city becomes more vibrant and lively.  In conclusion, car-free cities have many advantages for their inhabitants and the environment. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities can become greener, safer, and healthier, and these benefits can translate into a better quality of life for everyone. As concerns about climate change and air pollution continue to grow, the idea of car-free cities may become more popular in the future, and it is certainly worth considering.		1
School required students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. The time we live on right now students should get projects over the summer, so they can prepared for college and other things in life this is why the schools are giving them work so they dont forget about school and keep learning everyday. While some people around the world say that teachers should design the summer project for the students. It is better for the students to design their own summer project because they have better ideas, Can make their projects less stressful, and make it more fun with their friends.  All students in the world have better ideas to how to design your own project and make it better. Students have better understanding of what they want to do for there project like having better ideas and knowing what they want to work on. Cristiano Ronaldo wrote a article about why is good students should design their projects and why teacher should let them design their own article. Cristiano Ronaldo is a soccer star but he went to high school and know what the students want to do and design. He wrote on the article that students brain is still developing;he said that if students keep making their own decision and teachers let them choose their designs of projects they can come up with better ideas that other people cannot even think about. In the article he wrote that we students have a amazing brain and we can come u with the best ideas and design of projects that no one else can't. Everyone keep saying that teachers should make the designs of students projects for the summer.  Students of everywhere can make there project design less stressful if they get to choose what they can do. When students get to design there own project is less stressful for them because they can choose how they want to do it.  Leonel Messi came to every high school in the united states to talk about how stressful is when teacher give students projects over the summer. They make us work super hard and is super hard to communicate with their teacher over the summer. He talk to us that picking our own projects is way better than teachers picking the design because we can make our own ideas and it is less stressful and that is going to be easier. When students pick their design they don't need to worry about asking question to their teacher and stressing out. Messi told us that when he was in high school,he used to choose his own design of project because it was less stressful and more fun to do. when people keep saying that teacher should choose our design it so stressful because us as student want to choose our design for our summer project.  People in all high schools keep saying that is more fun for students to make our design of project ,because it makes our studies more fun and incredible. The mother of my friend ones told me that there is nothing more fun than getting to design a project as a student. She told me that when she was in high school their teacher choose the project for them and that wasn't fun for no student. That's why she told me that is more fun to get to choose your own design of project because when teachers get to choose them is super boring and stressful students sometimes cry. She told me that If i had the chance to make my own design to take it because it was not going to be fun to if the teacher choose the design. It is going to be more fun if you get to choose your own design for the summer project because i can get to make it with my friends and probably family members. Never let your teacher choose design the summer project for the students.  While other people might say that these summer projects should be teacher designed because the student keep learning more and keep working hard;however, if students make their own summer project design it is way better because student have better ideas, less stressful, and get to have more fun while doing the project. Messi gave us a great talk about how to choose your own design of project can make every students less stressful. Students around the world have a ruff time trying to do projects that their teacher gives them over the summer. Teachers should let students choose their own design so students can relax and have fun over the summer and they can keep doing there project and still have time to have fun with family and friends. Every student around the world should start making their own design for their project.   ¬†   ¬†		0
Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  Limiting car usage in suburban areas can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This growing trend of car-free communities and car-reduced lifestyles can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote healthier lifestyles, and create more accessible and sustainable communities.  One of the key advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a substantial amount of greenhouse gas emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. For example, in Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. By adopting a low-car suburban lifestyle, like in the German community of Vauban, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, individuals can contribute to the reduction of these harmful emissions. This helps in the fight against climate change and the preservation of the environment.  In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. Paris implemented a partial driving ban due to smog, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion. This demonstrates that reducing car usage can have immediate positive effects on air pollution levels. By promoting alternative transportation methods such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, car-free communities like Vauban and car-free days like the one in Bogota can help improve air quality and create healthier environments for residents.  Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote healthier lifestyles. In car-free communities, where walking and cycling are the primary means of transportation, residents are more physically active. This leads to improved health outcomes such as reduced risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and sedentary lifestyle-related conditions. By prioritizing pedestrian-friendly spaces and infrastructure, these communities create opportunities for residents to incorporate exercise into their daily routines, leading to healthier and more active lives.  Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and accessible communities. By adopting a smart planning approach, which includes placing stores along walkable main streets instead of distant malls, communities can become more compact and easily accessible via public transportation. This reduces the need for extensive parking spaces and makes daily activities more convenient for residents. It also promotes a sense of community by creating shared spaces and reducing the reliance on personal vehicles, encouraging social interactions and connection among residents.  In conclusion, limiting car usage in suburban areas offers a myriad of advantages. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to promoting healthier lifestyles and creating sustainable and accessible communities, the benefits of embracing car-free lifestyles are significant. As we continue to witness a shift in American behavior with fewer cars being bought and less driving occurring, it is important to recognize and support initiatives that limit car usage for the betterment of individuals and the environment.		1
Dear Florida senator,  I argue you in favor of keeping the electoral college in florida. i think it's a easier and better process than popular vote. It seems like to me it would take forever to count all the votes and add them up in all 50 states. our government counts all the votes up anyway but they count them by just it's own state. I feel like everyones voice is getting heard because it counts your vote but it's your states that votes.  The one problem I have with the electoral college is that some states are worth more votes than other states, which in my eyes is alittle unfair but it's our goverment. As florida we have 29 voter points and it's very useful to the running president that they gain our state. maybe if I was in the other states that have like 2 votes for the electoral college, then maybe I would be alittle upset and I would most likely not like the electoral college. It goes by the population of the states which makes sense because we don't want a small state choosing the president. It makes a real good point that the staes don't have the same amount of points, because if a state for example has 2,000 people and the other has 3,000 people, then the bigger population state should have the more electoral points.  If it wasnt for electoral college we wouldn't of had the great presidents we've had like for example John F. Kenndy. John lost by popular vote but won by electoral college. That is our great history and what if the electoral college saved us from a terrible president because not most of them tell the truth and are two faced. But i think electoral college is a great thing for us now and in the future.  Well thats our government and wether we like it or not their not going to change it. If it wasnt for congress and our government, America wouldn't be the same and were thankful for that. I just want to let you know senator that I like and agree with the electoral college . Keep up with all the good work Sir I know we can count on you .  From,  PROPER_NAME     ¬†¬†    		0
New technology and software can lead to great new things, but not in an educational environment. Facial Action Coding System is a new form of technology that can perceive feelings and weigh in different facial expressions of people. Something that would not help these schools and students, would be a computer in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of students. This would not be beneficial because the computer would disctrating to the students if they know they are being watched by a computer and the class would be less interested in the material. Also, the computer has no real way to connect with the students like a teacher could. That is why a computer to read emtions would not be beneficial to classrooms.  First, having a facial recognition system to detect your emotions in class would be too discrating to the students because they would have something monitoring their faces the whole class period. Not to mention, it would be in all of their classes. Evidence from the text to support this would be, "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." That would waste a lot of time to stop everytime one student gets confused of bored. Classes don't have enough time to do that and it would get them very behind.  Next, there would be no real interest in the class if they have something in the front of the room detecting them. A class should be informational and help a student learn, but also be fun and make them interested. Students get confused, that's what a teacher is for, to help them understand it when they get confused over something. Details from the passage to support this would be, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming cofused or bored". A student might understand the material, but it won't do much good if they hate the class because it's so dreaful, even if they might not show it.  Last, having a facial identification computer read emotions on a student is not valuable bc there is no real way for the teacher to connect with the students. A teacher is there for a reason, to help students learn. Being able to teach how they want and make it interesting in their own way is just a part of their job. Having a computer do most of their work is just as boring for them. Students and teachers can form real bonds, but not if they have a computer doing their job for them. Details to support this from the passage would be, "Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions." This same idea could go for teachers and school staff too.  To conclude, Facial Action Coding System is a great new thing, but not good for a classroom to read the emotional expressions of students. This would not be beneficial because the computer would not help students be more engaged if they know they are being watched by a computer and the class would be less interested in the material and it'd be no fun at all. Also, the computer has no real way to connect with the students like a teacher could and form a bond together. That is why a computer to read emtions would not be beneficial to classrooms. 		0
There is an argument going around on whether summer projects should be designed by students or teachers.  The summer projects should be designed by the teachers because students won't challenge themselves in the summer, teachers know what criteria the students should learn, and it is the teachers job to give the students work.  The topic on this discussion is very interesting, but we all know that its would be most beneficial for the teachers to design the summer project.  To start off; if students designed their own summer project they would make it easy.  Most students can't wait for the last day of school so they don't have to do any work or should I say "learn".  Also if they do a summer project it should help preview what they are going to be learning in the upcoming school year, so if they don't know exactly what it is that they will be learning why should they have to design their own project which most would not what to do in the first place.  In addition to the students designing their own project there are a lot of potential problems that could occur.  Like they forget to inform everyone else on what the project is.  The students just are not mature or responsible enough to be able to design such a hefty task like a summer project all on their own.  Secondly on why teacher should deign the summer projects, is the fact that they know what they will teacher in the following school year.  The students should begin to get informed or a little bit of knowledge on what they will be taught in the upcoming school year.  The teachers that design the summer project should make it about topics that they will later teach the students on.  For example, if there is a lesson on the cells in a plant for next year, maybe have the students create a plant cell out of recycled materials.  Just little things so they come into the classroom ready and already with some knowledge on what will be presented in the school year.  Lastly on why teachers should design the summer project is that its the teachers job to design such things.  A student should not have to worry about what they are going to do for a project.  That is too much pressure on the youth.  Instead maybe teachers collectively as a group come up with multiple project ideas for the students.  Give the students multiple options on what assignment or project they would want to do.  The teacher are getting paid to teach and come up with lesson plans.  Therefore it should not be the students task to come up with any projects¬†specifically¬†one like a summer project.  On the other hand, if students design their own projects that could help them mature.  Although it may just apply pressure and stress on the students which is what we don't want happening to them.  We shouldn't make kids design their own projects especially if most don't want to do it.  Teachers should be the ones designing the projects due to the fact that they get paid to create such things as projects and know what lessons are going to be taught in the following year, and students just aren't ready for this type of task.  The answer is rather clear that is should be the teachers designing the projects and not the students.		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.  The Electoral College is an outdated system that is no longer representative of the American people. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but lost the election to Donald Trump. This is not the first time that the Electoral College has resulted in a candidate winning the presidency without winning the popular vote. In fact, it has happened five times in the past 20 years.  The Electoral College is unfair to voters in states that are not considered to be "swing" states. Candidates know that they can win the presidency by focusing on a small number of states that are up for grabs, and they can ignore the needs of voters in other states. This is not only unfair to those voters, but it also means that the President is not truly representative of the American people.  The Electoral College also prevents candidates from campaigning on issues that are important to all Americans. Instead, they focus on issues that are important to voters in the swing states. This means that important issues like healthcare, education, and climate change are often ignored.  Abolishing the Electoral College would make the presidential election more fair and more democratic. It would also ensure that the President is truly representative of the American people. I urge you to support legislation that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
 I concur with Ralph Waldo Emerson, it is essential to be yourself rather than someone else. You won't have to face job perspectives that don't align with your personality. You won't have to be someone you're not. You can achieve many accomplishments throughout your life.  The first reason why I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson is that when it comes to jobs, it can be challenging for some individuals. Some jobs require you to be true to yourself, while others may not accept you for who you are. However, there are jobs that will appreciate you for being yourself, and you can find fulfillment in those roles.  Secondly, you shouldn't have to be someone you're not. You shouldn't have to please others at the expense of your own happiness. Some may argue that it is for the best, but in reality, it is not. You shouldn't have to change who you are just to fit in. Embrace your individuality and don't let anyone else dictate who you are.  Lastly, as Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment." Your uniqueness can bring you success and fulfillment. It can lead you to opportunities that you never imagined. Be yourself, and you will find that people will love and appreciate the real you. You can become a role model for others who are struggling to decide if they should be themselves or conform to society's expectations.  In conclusion, I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson that it is essential to be yourself rather than someone else. You won't have to face job perspectives that don't align with your personality, be someone you're not, and achieve great accomplishments. Some may argue that it is easier to conform, but in reality, it is not. Embrace your individuality, and you will find that people will love and appreciate the real you.		1
 Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are becoming increasingly popular as technology advances and researchers explore new ways to improve traffic flow and reduce accidents. The concept of driverless cars is an exciting one, as it has the potential to revolutionize the way we travel and live. However, as driverless cars become more prevalent, it's essential to consider the ethical, legal and social implications of this new technology.  From an ethical perspective, driverless cars raise questions about responsibility and accountability. If a driverless car is involved in an accident, who is to blame - the manufacturer, the user or the technology itself? As with any new technology, it's important to consider the potential risks and ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect users and others on the road.  Legally, there are also questions to be addressed. Driverless cars will require new regulations and laws to ensure their safety and enforce responsibility. For example, who will be held liable if a driverless car causes an accident? And how will insurance companies determine fault in such cases? As with any new technology, it's essential to work with regulators to ensure that appropriate laws and regulations are in place to protect users and others on the road.  Finally, there are social implications to consider. Driverless cars could have a significant impact on our transportation systems and the way we live. For example, they could lead to increased use of public transportation and decreased demand for parking, potentially leading to changes in urban planning and development. It's important to consider the potential social impacts of driverless cars and work to mitigate any potential negative effects.  In conclusion, while driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel and live, it's essential to consider the ethical, legal and social implications of this new technology. As with any new technology, it's important to approach driverless cars with caution and work to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect users and others on the road.		1

Starting a business provides a unique opportunity to become a master of a particular industry. For example, a person who starts a catering business can become a master chef, able to create delicious dishes and efficiently run a successful catering business. Gaining mastery in a specific business area is beneficial in that a person can become an authority in a particular field.   However, another approach a business owner might take is to take on multiple tasks and grow through experience. For example, a restaurant owner might gain knowledge and experience related to real estate, food sourcing, marketing, and personnel. By taking on roles outside of the core business skills, the restaurant owner can gain knowledge in a variety of areas, knowledge which can in turn lead to more creative and innovative ideas.   It is important for a business owner to stay on top of knowledge and experiences related to their business in order to remain diverse and competitive. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ‚ÄúDo not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. ?In business, it is important to think outside the box, to develop ideas and create solutions that are unique and innovative. Learning as much as possible in a variety of fields is the key to survival and success in the business world.		1
As the global concern for the environment increases with time, the desire to use cars decreases. People are aware that cars release fumes which, when combined, can be detrimental for the environment, and they want to do something about it. Elisabeth Rosenthal writes in her New York Times article, "In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars", that up to fifty percent of environmental greenhouse gas pollution comes from the cars driven in American suburbs. In her article, she quotes David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, that "All of our the U.S.A.'s development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change". It seems like America, and the rest of the world, is becoming more aware about what cars can do to the environment and that car usage needs to decrease, and they are taking steps to do so. So why should you limit your car usage? By limiting car usage, the average citizen can decrease pollution and harmful greenhouse gases that are causing damage to the environment, improve living conditions in large cities and reduce smog, and feel better in general, with more exercise and less stress.  In the past decade, America has struggled with an obesity epidemic. In the early 2000s, obesity was at its peak, with mcdonald's "Super Size" menu options, huge SUVs, and endless television programs to keep couch potatos on the couch. If you visit New York City's Manhattan, you won't see a whole lot of obese people hurrying down 5th avenue to hop on the subway or pick up groceries at the local market. Why is this? Not many people drive in NYC, mainly because it would be far too expensive to buy and park a car in this already monumentally expensive city. The cars one does generally see are either from out of state, taxis, or businessmen who live in the other boroughs of the city. Very few who live in Manhattan drive. Most people take the subway, walk, or use bikes to get around. Because of the way it's made, everything one needs is just a few blocks away, from the grocery store, to the drugstore, to the postoffice, to the bank, there really is no need to have a car. If you have to go to the airport, just take a cab. Naturally, people who walk and bike everywhere are slimmer and healthier. In the suburbs, this is not the story. Many people in the suburbs drive cars out necessity, because it would take the whole day to walk to the grocery store and back. The way suburbs are set up, walking or biking is almost impossible to do if it's not for leisure. Driving around all day to pick up kids, go to work, and finally pull into the home garage can be draining and stressful. If people were to get around and get exercise at the same time, they would be less stressed and healthier. Andrew Selsky quoted businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza in his article, "Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota". Plaza said that, "It's limiting car usage a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution". Many people are already doing this. Vauban, Germany, is a new "carfree" suburb. In this town, things are close together, just like a city, eliminating the need to use cars. It is not illegal to own a car in Vauban, but people who do must pay a heavy fine and pay for parking on the edge of the city that is also highly expensive. People in the German suburb get along fine without cars, because of the way the city was built. The idea of a "carreduced" community appeals to the U.S. as well, and legislators and other government officials are trying to make it happen for the environment as well as the sake of the people.  Bejjing is supposedly the most polluted city in the world, and Paris the most beautiful, but Paris is more polluted than one would think. Robert Duffer reports in his article, "Paris bans driving due to smog", that Paris, after suffering from "five days of intensive smog" called for some drivers to abstain from using their cars for the day or face a fine of twentytwo euros. The system was based on license plate numbers. One day, the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be able to drive, the next the ones with odd numbered license plates. This helped reduce smog in the city, which is more polluted than others in Europe like Brussels and London. Once the smog cleared, the ban was rescinded. This ban on cars, although only for a short period of time, is actually a great idea. Emissions from cars cause a large amount of smog to pollute the air, which is bad for both the inhabitants of the city and the environment. The reduction of the use of cars will reduce the amount of smog in the air in large cities, and improve the living conditions in those cities. Almost two centuries ago, smog, soot, and dirt covered Victorian London and its people. This smog was not from cars, but rather from the rising popularity of factories powered by fossil fuels such as coal. Today, all cities of the world are polluted, and almost two hundred years have passed. Shouldn't some improvements regarding the environment and smog in cities have been made by now? There is just as much environmental damage being done as there was in 19th century London, but now, instead of factories being the main cause, it's cars. Although cities are cleaner now, they are just as polluted. In Bejjing, some say the air is so dirty that if you blow your nose, your tissue turns black! It is the 21st century, and we have to be taking strides to improve the environment for the good of the people who live in cities like Paris and Bejjing.  Limiting car usage is important to create a better living environment for people as well as improve their wellbeing, but the most important reason is to limit pollution and damage to the environment due to emmisions from cars. President Obama, according to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article, "The End of Car Culture", has "ambitious goals to curb the Unites States' greenhouse gas emissions". If the President of the United States is concerned, this means it is a real problem. The immense amount of greenhouse gases caused by cars has already aided Global Warming and the damage to the ozone layer that exists today. If car usage increases or holds steady, even more damage will be done, so much so that it may become unfixable in the future. If the world does not cut back now on its vehicle usage and reduce environmental damage, things will only get harder to fix. But things are looking good for Mother Nature, because according to all four articles given, including, "In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, "Paris bans driving due to smog", by Robert Duffer, "Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota", by Andrew Selsky, and "The End of Car Culture", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, people are already taking steps to reduce the use of cars and better the environment.  Ever since the Model T came out in the early 20th century, cars have become more and more popular in America as well as around the world. They have become so popular, in fact, that they have become a problem. Cars emit harmful greenhouse gases that pollute the environment and cause excess smog in large cities. They can also be stressful and unhealthy for people who depend on them for everyday modes of transport. Limiting car usage is important and will help not only the environment, but also the people of the world.		0
The Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. Using it for students in the classroom would be valuable. It'd be valuable because it would benefit students and recognizing others' emotions, benefit the students' feelings, and it'd help the way they're educated.  The way the Facial Action Coding System would benefit students' is recognizing their emotions and facial expressions. It'd help the way they learn and what content is good in front of them. With certain material, all students interpret it in their own way. It would benefit how they feel about what is in front of them and what they're learning.  FACS would help others recognize emotions is because after using it and watching others, one would be educated on the technology and the way it works with humans. In the article it says that the system has up to 44 major face muscles working just like human muscles. One would learn how the new technology works after using it and it would improve how they read others themselves. " 'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.' (like not smiling as broadly)." WIth that being said from the article, it shows that basically all the same muscles are used to one general emotion and one could adapt that to their mind and be more educated about it.  Also, FACS would benefit students feeling stronger. D'Alto talks about drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky and how he has his actors "carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Empathy(feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions." So after using the technology and practicing so much of feeling unknowingly, students would learn how to be emotionally healthy and how to balance their feelings.  FACS would benefit the students' and the way they learn by practicing keeping them alert during their lessons and schoolwork online. After the right content being provided due to their feelings and emotions, it would become natural for them to stay focused. In the article, D'Alto explains how one's feeling will trigger what is in the screen. He says, " 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." Students would be provided the right material as they go about the lesson.  In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding system would be very beneficial to student in a various amount of ways. The FACS would benefit students with recognizing emotions, benefit their feelings, and the students' education. FACS will better students and school systems.		0
Failure is an inevitable part of life, and it's something that everyone experiences at some point. It's a difficult topic to talk about, but it's essential to understand its role in our lives and how it can lead to success. In this essay, I will discuss the connection between failure and success, and how attitude, enthusiasm, and learning from mistakes shape this relationship.  Firstly, it's important to understand that failure is not a negative thing. It's simply a learning experience that can help us grow and improve. When we fail, we learn valuable lessons that can help us succeed in the future. For example, if we fail an exam, we may realize that we need to study more or that we need to improve our time management skills. These lessons can help us succeed in future exams and in other areas of our lives.  Secondly, attitude plays a crucial role in how we respond to failure. If we have a positive attitude, we are more likely to see failure as an opportunity for growth and improvement. We may view it as a challenge that we can overcome, rather than as a setback. On the other hand, if we have a negative attitude, we may view failure as a sign of inadequacy or failure. This attitude can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair, which can make it harder to overcome failure and move forward.  Thirdly, enthusiasm is also essential in the connection between failure and success. When we are enthusiastic about something, we are more likely to put in the effort and persevere through challenges. This enthusiasm can help us overcome failure and keep us motivated to continue working towards our goals. For example, if we are enthusiastic about starting a new business, we may be more likely to put in the hard work and overcome any obstacles that come our way.  Finally, learning from mistakes is crucial in the connection between failure and success. When we learn from our mistakes, we become better equipped to handle future challenges and overcome failure. We can identify what went wrong and take steps to prevent it from happening again. For example, if we failed an exam because we didn't study enough, we can learn from this mistake and study more in the future.  In conclusion, failure is an essential part of life, and it can lead to success if we approach it with the right attitude, enthusiasm, and a willingness to learn		1
Hey, Mrs. Johnson!  Here's my essay on the benefits of attending a four-year high school instead of a three-year one.   So, I think it's pretty obvious that attending a four-year high school has a lot of advantages. First of all, you get more time to explore your interests and passions. With an extra year, you can take more classes, join more clubs, and participate in more extracurriculars. And let's be real, who doesn't want to be the captain of the debate team or the president of the science club?   Another benefit is that you get more time to develop your skills and knowledge in a particular area. Like, if you're really into math, you can take more advanced classes and get more prepared for college or a career in that field. Or, if you're into art, you can take more classes and get more experience with different mediums and techniques.   Also, attending a four-year high school can give you a better chance of getting into college. Like, if you apply to a four-year college, you'll have more opportunities to take challenging classes and show off your skills. Plus, you'll have more time to prepare for standardized tests and applications.   And let's not forget about the social benefits! With an extra year, you get more time to make new friends and connect with your classmates. You can form deeper bonds and build stronger relationships, which can be really important for your mental health and well-being.   Now, I know some people might say that attending a four-year high school is too long, or that it's too expensive. But, in my opinion, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Like, sure, it might be an extra year, but it's an extra year to learn and grow and develop as a person. And, honestly, the cost is worth it in the long run.   So, there you have it! Attending a four-year high school is definitely the way to go.  It might be a little extra, but it's worth it in		1
 I completely agree with the statement that a positive attitude can make a significant impact on one's life. A positive attitude can bring optimism and hope into even the most challenging situations, making it easier to overcome obstacles and find solutions. It is a crucial component of a successful and fulfilling life.  When you adopt a positive attitude, you see the world in a different light. You become more optimistic and expect the best to happen. This mindset can help you avoid negative thinking and worries, and instead focus on the possibilities and opportunities that lie ahead. This can lead to a more constructive and productive approach to life, and ultimately lead to greater success and happiness.  A positive attitude also has a ripple effect, as it can influence the people around you and the environment you live in. When you radiate positivity, it can inspire and motivate others to do the same, creating a positive and uplifting atmosphere. This can lead to a more harmonious and supportive community, and can even have a positive impact on the world at large.  In addition to its benefits for your own life, a positive attitude can also help you achieve your goals and dreams. When you believe in yourself and trust your abilities, you are more likely to take action and work hard towards your goals. This can lead to greater success and fulfillment, and can help you achieve the things that you truly want in life.  Overall, I believe that a positive attitude is a powerful tool for success and happiness. It can help you overcome challenges, find opportunities, and achieve your goals. By cultivating a positive mindset, you can transform your life and the lives of those around you, and create a brighter and more fulfilling future for yourself and others.		1
Humankind has always been fascinated with the concept of cars. Motorized vehicles that effortlessly take you from one area to another when compared to more traditional methods such as walking. Everyone wanted a car for themselves to become a part of the innovation. But as time has passed, we now realized that it was naive of us to think cars were going to revolutionize transport, as some of the more simpler ways of transport (bike riding, bus) outshined car ownership in practicality and efficiency.  Now more than ever, alternative transportation methods are being promoted heavily in order to reduce the amount of pollution in the atmosphere. A shining example of this is in Paris, France ("Paris bans driving due to smog", source two), where the goverment took the initiative to limit the usage of vehicles to reduce the amount of smog in the city.  Paris, one of the most idolized cities in the world, was at a point where the density of smog and pollutants in the air rivaled Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. However, after the driving ban in Paris, the city saw a drastic reduction in the amount of pollutants in the air, as it dropped down from 147 micrograms of particulate matter/cubic meter. Not only that, but Paris also saw an inprovement in car traffic, dropping down to 40 percent of what it originally was five days after the ban.  With all this in mind, how does this benefit the population without looking at the pollution reduction? This can also benefit us physically and psychologically. In Bogota, Colombia, a generally congested city, filled with traffic jams and other problems; Mayor Antanas Mockus promoted alternative transportation in the "Day Without Cars event"(Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, source 3). In an effort to encourage public transportation in the city of 7 million inhabitants, Mockus promoted an event in which the only form of motorized transportation available was taxi cabs and bus rides. This mean that the people took the opportunity to bike, walk, hike from one point to another. Subsequently, this also indirectly promoted physical fitness and a stress release for people wanting to take the chance to enjoy their day. As Carlos Plaza evidently states that it is a great way to take away stress, while on a bike ride with his wife. Colombia has also opened up new bike path, parks, and sports centers, which is all the more proof that this initiative is promoting physical fitness and psychological wellness.  One could argue that this revolution of alternative transportation could have negative consequences on car industries and other businesses that rely on personal vehicle, and they wouldn't be wrong. But this phenomenon doesn't necessarily have to hurt anyone, as these same industries can promote their time and resources on projects that also promote alternative transportation. Just as well, in recent years, the amount of people getting driver's licenses and relying on personal vehicles has seen a significant decline, such as the amount of young prople driving decreaed 23 percent from 2001 to 2009, or when a study showed the amount of miles driven by the average American peaked in 2005 and steadily declined since then (The End of Car Culture, Source 4). People started to see the efficiency of alternative transportation, and capitalized on the opportunity to make transportation more accessible to everyone. Whether its from the expanding biclycle paths in New York City, to the Bay Area Rapid Transport in San Francisco, these are just a few examples of the steadily growing list of cities promoting more accessible transportation.  So with all of this in mind, there is irrefutable evidence that the more simpler methods of alternative transportation to limit vehicular usage is more efficient and practical. As seen in Paris where the city saw a significant drop in the amount of smog the city contained. Or when Bogota where an event that banned vehicular usage promoted physical and psychological wellness. People opting for alternative transportation is the global phenomenon that benefits us in more ways than we can imagine. There''s no doubt that the older, more traditional methods of transportation out perform personal vehicles in efficiency.    		0
Phones and Driving  Accidents and crashes caused by distracted driving has made many question whether the use of phones should be allowed while operating vehicles. Mobile phones have been around since the early 1970s and have been progressing since then. The ease of use of modern day phones encourages use while on the road especially for those who utilize their cellphones as a way of business. Responsible use of cellphones should be allowed due to the importance cellphones carry for every individual. Although distracted driving is very dangerous and has resulted in many casualties and fatalities, there are many ways to prevent an accident.  Cellphones give ease of access and helps with so many things that it's considered a necessity to have one. It's uses vary from GPS, to calling friends and relatives, to business conference calls, browsing the web, checking news and your email, so on and so forth. Naturally utilizing these features on the road makes things convenient  Last Name 2            		0
Dear principal,  This is a story of why I think it would be good to let students have phones during school I think us students should be able to have our phones because it could save our lives, it can help us during school, and it could help the school save money.  Firstly, they can save our lives. What if we got into a incident where we had to call for help, and we had to get someone to safety fast. We can't run down that could take minutes that we could take away someone life. That's why I think we should have phones in case of emergency. There could be a storm that wipes out all the schools power, so that would mean no phones, no computer, and more importantly no help. That is my way of thinking what could happen.  Second, phone could help us during and out of school. Some phones might have texting ability and that could help your buddy, like for intense say if one of your friends missed a day and there was some important notes. He or she would really want to know that information there could be a test the next day; he or she is in trouble. You starting to see how they could help now.  Next, they can help schools save money. There are some things that schools use that could be program on phones that are free like a calculator. We use calculators every day of our lives so why not replace those costly calculators with the cooler, nicer, and down right awesome cell phones.  My final reason, I really think that phones in school could really improve the Untied States education. They can help, save our lives, and save our school money. Thank you for reading.

I think the Facial Action Coding System to identify human emotions is not a good idea because some people might be keeping things from other people that might make them sad, mad, or disgusted about someone and then there will be a problem with those people. But also this could be a good thing because it could help with what people are going though in there life. And this could help cuicide problems for alot of places.  This might be a bad thing because it could cause conversy with people and might split people apart from there family, friends, or co-workers. For an example if two people are in a relationship and if one person is disgusted, mad, or sad and the other might ask what they are disgust, mad or sad at the other personor something. And because they did Mona Lisa it doesn't give an good example and it only shows the positive side and if did this on a high school student like they want to it might show more of a negitive responsed.  But in other terms this could be a good thing for some people because it could help people with what they are going though in there life. This could also possible lower the number's of cuicide percent for some places and mostly for people. It could lower places cuicide rates by if they mad, disgusted or sad people could ask what they are though and maby get that thing of there cheat could be a good thing for them. "She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and2 percent angry" this shows that it does indeed work and if were going to do it a different person or painting you will get different percent's that will better understand what some people might be going though in life.  I truely think this could be made for good reasons if used right and not for only student but people all around the world s we could see what is going on someother places. But if it used to much it could start some bad things with student, familys, and co-workes.		0
Having students take classes from home could work out very well, but also at the same time be very defective to the student, simple as becoming less motivated to do stuff as in sports and extra after school activities, I would love to take my classes from my home being that i wouldn't have to raise my hand for things, ask to go to the bathroom, or let along ask borrow something. I also feel that students would get in less trouble if they were to take classes from home, therefore theres less of a chance of students getting into fights with others and less of a chance of students showing up late to class. Being in the comfort of your home while working on class assignments is what most students would want instead of being cramped up at school with other students.  There are mostly flaws with this idea, consequently students wouldnt always be focused on what there really suppose to be doing, I wouldnt¬†really understand or know how it would work or how it would process therefore i couldnt say that all students would even attend the class since there is no school to go to. I think a majority of the students would be lazy and like i said less motivated to get up and do stuff because school isnt just a place where you get your education its also a place where you learn how to become a young adult and being at home everyday taking online classes would not teach any of the skills of being a young adult.  In fact taking the online classes instead of going to school could be challenging for most because some students may not have the basic requirements to get on to the online course as in a computer/device and internet overall if it came down to having to take online classes or just go to school id rather take the online classes, speaking for my self i know that i have the requirements to take online classes others may disagree.  For the parents that are involved it would probably be a hassle for them as well and what i mean by that is they would have to be the ones to register you into your online classes and plus some parents may not trust there kids home alone while there at work, I cant say that all parents would have a problem with it in fact some parents might love it because it saves them the trip of having to come down to the school when something bad happens let along helps parents that take there kids to school, therefore it helps them on their time management. Overall having a online class for students would actually be very beneficial just cause of the less inconvenience of getting to school and finishing school.		0

Dear, TEACHER_NAME  I think you should allow us the students to bring our phones to school and use them during lunch and free time as long as there turned off during class periods.  We are very responsible.  Lunch is a free time so we should be able to do what we want at that time. Also we will listen to all rules for cellular phone because we are responsible young adults.  Lunch is a time for us to socialize with friends. that's a time when we talk to friends and goof around. we should be able to have them cause that's our free time and we should be able to text and talk during that time. At that point and time nobody is worried bout work were talk to friends and telling bout how good our day is so far.  All rules you demand swill be followed like beside lunch and free times phones are not to be seen or there will be consequences of your choice. we are very responsible with putting them up at the appropriate time. We understand we have to learn at some point during the day and during that time we know okay its time t learn all cell phone put away!  We are very responsible young adult as long as you tell us the rules. they will be followed. This is something very good for us. there isn't anyway a phone could distract us from learning if there put away during "the teachers time". Nothing should go wrong to the point where you take the privilege away. We will take putting up our phone as a very valid responsibility.  We really want this opportunity to show you 1. we are responsible and 2. we can handle anything you throw at us. We are going to have no problems with i promise there will be phone away during class. you will only see them in the hall, during free time, and also lunch. We want to show you we can be big girls and boys but still learn in the same matter as we should. So on behalf or the entire school body i am asking you may you please allow us to bring phones to school and let us use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as we turn them off during academic classes. :)		0
Everyone makes millions of choices in his or her lifetime. While making these choices, it is not uncommon for one to ask others for advice. Often, one will consult multiple people. It is always an excellent idea to receive multiple opinions when one is making an important choice or decision because this gives one an open mind to all methods and ideas, lets one know what the most reliable choices are based on how many have suggested them, and all while still allowing the decision-maker to choose the best option for himself.  Consulting multiple people for ideas and suggestions allows one to have an open mind when considering every different method. This can be evidenced by my own experience. One time, I had to decide what to get with money I had received for my birthday. I knew I wanted clothes, but I could not decide which kind. I believed it would always be practical to buy uniforms for school. However, my friends suggested I purchased clothing such as merchandise, sportswear, accessories, even things that were not clothes! All of these suggestions baffled me at first, but then i realized they were actually fantastic ideas! Ultimately, I decided to compare every suggestion I received and decide what to spend my money on based off of that. I realized that buying uniforms would be a bit of a waste and that I already had plenty, whereas there was a bit of a dearth when it came to clothes I actually enjoyed wearing. Without my friends, I never would have realized that! Ultimately, I ended up purchasing whatever clothes made me happy, such as those I found aesthetically pleasing and those that reminded me of things I enjoy. Despite thinking it was impractical at first, I am still very pleased with my choice and I never would have made it without the consultation I got from others.  Taking advice from others also shows which method of action holds the best results. For example, a few years ago, I needed to decide which middle school to attend. All of my friends were going to different schools, so i did not know what to do. I decided to look into the schools themselves rather than which ones my friends were attending. I looked for a school that met my personal standards and one that adults I know can tell me about. A lot of people told me that Generic_School was in my best interest and most closely fit the criteria I was looking for. They told me about the positives and negatives of it and compared it to other schools. It took me a while to make the decision, but I am glad I did. No school is perfect but I believe that this one was the best for me. This proves that recommendations are always good things to take into consideration when making an important decision.  Receiving multiple opinions is also wise because it gives insight on other people's perspectives while still allowing the decision-maker to make the choice that works best for him or her. An example of this is one that comes from my own experience. When deciding what to do this summer, I was given three options. I had to decide between traveling to West Virginia, traveling to Colorado, or staying here in Virginia and attending the Generic_School. My sister reminded me that going to West Virginia has not been pleasant for the two of us in the because never had anything to do. Then, my mom reminded me that going to Colorado means I will have to stay with my grandmother, who may try to convince me to call my father. Lastly, one of my friends suggested I attend Generic_School because I will have friends going there and I will be given the chance to improve my art. In the end, I decided I would like to travel to Colorado. Even with the possible downside, Colorado is my favorite place and I would be happy to return again, as I have not been there in years. The guidance from others helped me make my decision, but it was still up to me, and I am happy I was given the option to travel where I would like.  In conclusion, getting multiple opinions on decisions before making them is never a bad idea. The things I believe, such as that multiple opinions provide open-mindedness, multiple similar reccomendations can be reliable, and that listening to suggestions does not mean one needs to follow them, have made me believe that it is always practical to take other ideas into consideration and decide which option works best in whatever situation one is in.¬†		0
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:  Pros and Cons of a 4-Day School Week with Ten Hours of School Each Day  As a student, I think it's pretty cool that some schools are considering having a 4-day school week with ten hours of school each day. I mean, who doesn't love more sleep and more time to do stuff on the weekends? But, after thinking about it, I realized there are some pros and cons to this idea.  First, the pros. I think the most obvious one is that we would get more sleep. Ten hours of school each day might seem like a lot, but it's actually better than the eight hours we usually get. And, let's be real, sleep is super important for our brains and bodies. So, if we get more sleep, we might be able to focus better in class and learn more stuff. Plus, we would have more time to do other things on the weekends, like hang out with friends or play sports.  But, there are also some cons to this idea. One of them is that we might not have enough time to do all our homework. With ten hours of school each day, we would have to do a lot of work at home, and that could be really overwhelming. And, if we don't have enough time to finish our homework, we might get in trouble with our teachers. Plus, we might not have as much time to relax and unwind after school.  Another con is that we might miss out on some important activities. Like, if we have a four-day school week, we might not be able to go to as many sports games or club meetings. And, if we're not able to participate in these activities, we might feel left out or bored.  In conclusion, while a 4-day school week with ten hours of school each day might seem like a good idea at first, there are some pretty big cons to it. We might not have enough time to do our homework, we might miss out on important activities, and we might not have enough time to relax. So, I think it's important to think carefully about the pros and cons before making a decision.  I		1
Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I mean, like, its just too dangerous, you know? Like, imagine your driving down the road and your on the phone, and your not paying attention to the road and then BAM! You hit someone! Its like, not worth the risk, you feel me?  Like, I know some people think that its fine to use your phone while driving because, like, its not a big deal, but its actually super dangerous. Your not paying attention to the road and your putting yourself and others in danger. And, like, what if you get in an accident and you cant call for help because your phone is dead? Its just not worth it, bro.  Plus, like, its illegal in a lot of places now, so your not even supposed to be on your phone while driving anyways. So, like, why risk it? Just, like, put your phone away and focus on the road, you know? Its just better that way.  And, like, I know some people think that they can, like, multi-task and drive at the same time, but, like, honestly, its just not possible. Your brain can only focus on one thing at a time, and if your on your phone, your not focusing on the road. Its just science, bro.  So, in conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Its just too dangerous and not worth the risk. Your better off just focusing on the road and driving safely, you feel me?		1
Dear: Principal  Well this change that your doing is not cool because the kids would just have to work on studying and not a little bit of fun during school hours. If i was you i would let the kids be in sports having and representing my school but as long as they have a c average. I think your not letting us have fun and representing your school because maybe you didn't have the chance to play or be in a sport when you were little. See we probably try our hardest but we just don't understand the class and kids also need to be having something to do besides work and more work us kids will get tired of working so much that probably going to drop out, we kids need to be working out or have something in our minds besides work and work.  Kids our age do need to learn but we also need to have fun too you know, to much work will make us forget some stuff that we already know, so it will be nice if we just had some time to relax, and not think about school or homework. So hope you change your mind about us having a b average just so we can play any sport it will be nice if you did.		0
While technology to identify human emotions could have benefits, using FACS monitoring of students in classrooms raises privacy and bias concerns that outweigh its value.   FACS was created to advance scientific understanding of facial expressions and nonverbal cues. Its creators likely intended it to be used cautiously and ethically. Applying it to continuously monitor students risks invading their privacy and altering classroom dynamics in unforeseen ways.   Students deserve a learning environment that feels safe and comfortable enough to take intellectual risks. Constant emotional surveillance could make students self-conscious and less willing to actively participate for fear of having their facial reactions analyzed and potentially judged. This might hinder creative and critical thinking.   There is also the concern that FACS, while attempting to identify universal expressions, could reflect cultural biases in its programming. Different cultures and individuals express emotions in varied ways. What one algorithm reads as confusion, frustration or boredom may simply be another style of expression. Misreading facial cues could unfairly influence teachers' perceptions and evaluations of students.  Proponents argue FACS data could help teachers tailor lessons to better engage students. But teachers already draw on a variety of strategies and cues like students' questions, comments and assignment feedback to assess engagement. FACS risks becoming a shortcut or crutch that distracts from these human interactions. Its interpretations of fleeting micro-expressions could also be taken out of context or overemphasized relative to broader indicators of understanding.   In some targeted research applications, FACS technology may prove useful when carefully designed protocols protect student privacy and prevent biases. But for regular classroom use, the drawbacks likely outweigh any benefits. Students' well-being and freedom to fully participate are better served with human relationships of trust between teachers and students, not constant electronic monitoring of emotional responses. Overall, FACS does not appear sufficiently developed or tested to warrant its values application for emotion surveillance in classrooms at this time.		1
 Dear Principal Johnson,   I am writing regarding the school's policy concerning student cell phone use. As the student body representative, I wanted to share our perspective on the two options being considered.   After gathering feedback from my classmates, the policy that seems preferable is Policy 1, which would allow students to bring phones to school but require them to be turned off during class time. There are a few key reasons this option is better in our opinion.  First, many students rely on their phones to communicate with parents about after-school activities or transportation. Not allowing phones at all could make coordinating schedules difficult. Policy 1 would still allow messaging during free periods.   Secondly, an outright ban may backfire by encouraging some students to sneak phones into class or use them in the bathroom where they can't be monitored. With Policy 1, phones can be out in the open during approved times so teachers know who has one. This promotes transparency.  Lastly, many students see phones as a basic tool nowadays, just like calculators or notebooks. An outright ban feels overly restrictive when phones aren't causing issues if used appropriately. Policy 1 enforces appropriate use rather than banning the technology altogether.  In summary, we think Policy 1 strikes the right balance of allowing phones for organization while still maintaining focus during instructional time. It promotes responsibility instead of bans. I hope you will consider this perspective as you make your decision. Please let me know if any additional input would be helpful.  Thank you for your consideration.  Sincerely,  [Your name] Student Body Representative		1
Many times we as humans study things that have been studied hundreds of times. Amost like we think the we might be able to prove the findings wrong or something. Why don't we study things that no has ever studied before? Why don't we try to strive for more. The only reason why Pluto is not a planet no longer is cause we know there is more planets beyond.  Venus is one of the things that we really have never studied. Even though the odds are greatly against humans with a extremely hot 800 degree surface, and much more we should try to create a space craft that could reach and survive the elements. Spend time in the lab, andtry to find a new material that could with stand the elements.  We had flew to the moon hundreds of times, and circled the sun many times to. Expand the possiblities, and raise the bar on what the human raise can do. Challlenge ourselves, and expand dreams and knowledge. Make another planet possible if we ever do need to leave planet Earth!    		0
The laws have changed. We now have days where we cannot use our cars for the day. We can only get around using buses, a local taxi, bikes, walk etc,. Would this benefit us or would it not? Some cities and countries around the world are banning cars. Instead they would like to use public transportation, a bicycle, or maybe your own two feet to get around. I believe that this topic is reasonable and I agree.  The United States is considering this law of not having to use our cars for a day or two each week so we can get out in the fresh air or try out some new transportation for personal knowledge of more ways to get around. The paper, The End of Car Culture, states that "recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by." Assuming, we are already shifting into a lifestyle of not having a car for a day or two. To me, this would benefit the country because of our high obesity rate. If more people ride their bikes to places or walk places, this will give them more exercise opportunities and help them lose weight in a more constructive way. Just riding your bike or walking a mile to the grocery store a day can definitely help someone out.  Speaking of helping things out, how about the environment? The article, Paris band driving due to smog, states that "After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." Robert Duffer also states that Paris uses Mondays to be dedicated ro evennumbered license plates are ordered to leave their cars at home and the next day oddnumbered license plates were ordered to keep their cars home. The diesel fuel in Paris was hurting the environment so that is why they banned cars. Here in the United States I believe that the car pollution is also hurting our environment. Riding bikes and walking places is a good activity for everyone to do.  Most of us, except the 2% of people in America, have trouble with money. Riding bikes around and walking to a friends house or to the store, would definitely help our money situations. Not having a car two days a week means we do not have to get gas as much, which would save us money. Using a taxi would be useful too but, not as much because the money adds up also. Not using cars can completely help our community and country in so many ways.  Banning cars for a day or two sounds like a fantastic idea. Being able to go out and get fresh air and get some exercise would be great for our country. Less pollutions, less money and more constructive activities for getting around to places. All sounds like a good idea to me. Let's see if the United States takes action.		0
Do you like driving? If you do you may want to look into some of these new driving restrictions. In places like Germany, Paris, Bogota, and even in the United States people are driving a lot less. In other countries driving is partially banned. For instance in Bogota driving was banned for one day. Many said it was a relaxation and even a stress reliever.  Driving you car less can help many things in multiple ways, such as the environment or even people. The more we drive the more we hurt the environment. Places like Vauban, Germany have expensive parking spaces and if you want to drive then you must buy the parking space that cost $40,000. These spaces are at the edge of the city and you must walk home if you must have a car.  In the United States we have been buying less cars ever since 2005. In 2005 we hit our driving peak when we had sold most cars and were driving the most. Now that we are in 2015 less people are even getting their license. "As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak." Sociologists believe it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. "A recent study found that driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009."  In Paris they banned drivng due to smog. They had near-record pollution, so they decided to ban driving. This was only a partial ban but it still had a big impact. "On monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine." Then the same would apply to odd-numbered plates the next day. Congestion was down 60 percent after five days of starting this partial ban.  In conclusion if we start driving less we will be less stressed and will be doing good for the environment. At the rate we are driving less we will be doing many good things for the environment and for other peopleas well.       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†    		0
 As a student, I am not familiar with the cowboy culture or the concept of riding waves. However, I can still create an essay based on the given topic using my research skills and creativity.  A cowboy who rode the waves is a metaphorical term that refers to someone who excels in multiple domains of life. It implies that the person has qualities such as versatility, adaptability, determination, and a willingness to take risks.  The cowboy culture, with its hardworking spirit and independence, has influenced various aspects of American society, including literature, music, film, and even language. Cowboy movies often depict characters who are masters of their craft, whether it be roping a cow or riding a horse. These characters are known for their unique abilities to handle different situations with ease and confidence.  Similarly, a cowboy who rode the waves in life has a wide range of skills and talents that enable them to handle various challenges. These individuals may be proficient in one area while also having knowledge or experience in others. For example, a cowboy who is skilled at horseback riding may also have expertise in farming, ranching, or cow roping. They may even have additional hobbies or interests such as fishing or hunting.  Besides having multiple talents, a cowboy who rode the waves is typically independent and self-reliant. They have a strong work ethic and are not afraid to take on risks in order to achieve their goals. This mindset allows them to adapt to different situations and environments with ease.  It is also worth noting that a cowboy who rode the waves has a strong sense of adventure and a willingness to try new things. They are not afraid to step outside of their comfort zone and take on new challenges. This mindset enables them to explore various facets of life and gain new experiences.  In conclusion, a cowboy who rode the waves is a metaphorical term that refers to someone who excels in multiple domains of life. These individuals have unique abilities to handle various situations with ease and confidence. They are independent, self-reliant, and have a strong work ethic. They also have a sense of adventure and a willingness to take risks in order to achieve their goals.		1
Does we are really voting for the elector or someobody else?, sometimes elections can be unfair but one of the best methos and the one more easily to understand and fair is by electing the president by popular vote.  To beging with,every state should be treatly the same, have the respect campaings and no one state should have advantage or disadvante at the time of voting because sometimes representatives can give a advantage or a disadvantage and sometimes can give a catasrophic decision, but also more power for bigger sates that represents 35 million voters like california."given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people".  other example of this can be seen in te elections of 2000,"seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including rhole island and south california,and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. And this just show how when we have electoral collegue can be a disadvantage for candidates, if they know they are not going to win they don't focus on those states,and some people who want to have more options or listen to other persons they cant because they dont see a campaign to convice them.  In summary,its better to the winner to take all cause almost half of the population agrred with the candidate thinking and maturity to select whats best to others,but also whe you are voting fot the state elector you cant control their final vote and sometimes you don't choose who you is your state elector and you don't now if he has the best wisenes to decide,if two presidents in popupal vote get close that mean that¬† a lot of people agreed with the same person,but that doesnt happen when we have electoral because its just a minimum number and we dont now if everybody in the state really agreed with the representator.  To summarize,if we want a fair election and be part of it, listen to others options, have part of the the decision of our president , and be trheated the same and the our vote really counts we should elect by popular vote.       ¬†    		0
Summer projects should be student-designed because this is their time to relax. Students should not have to go through more school work during their time off. How would you feel if you get worked handed to you on your day off? Students should be able to design their projects because this is a students personal time, some students learn different from others, and students should be able to do a project that they enjoy.  To start off, this is a students personal time. Most students would not want to have work handed to them during the summer because they have been in school for ten months. Students should feel as if this is their time to relax and do whatever it is that they like. If they have to do a project, it should be something that they want to do instead of what the teacher wants them to do. For example, back in elementary school my teacher gave us a reading project to do over the break. It was a book that I hated and I thought, "Who even likes to read, let alone over break." I was so made that we have to do this project, but if it had been a book that i actually wanted to read, I would have been more likely to do the project.  Secondly, some students learn in different ways than others. Not every single person learns the same as the next. Everyone is either an auditory, a visual, or a hands-on learner. Many people could prefer something totally different from you, so a teacher just handing a student a project and telling them to do it, will not help them to learn. For instance, I am a visual and hands-on learner, but the person next to me could be an auditory learner.  Lastly, students should be able to do a project that they enjoy. If students are given a project that they do not want to do or are at least interested in, the chances of them doing it are low. They don't even want to have work over the break, but if they are given something that they are interested in, they will most likely do it.  Some will think agree with my claim, others will disagree. The ones that disagree will probably say that teachers should design the projects. They may say that the teacher knows what is best for their students and that if the students have some authority over their project, they will do or pick something that does nothing for their knowledge and education. They may also say that they need to learn that not everything can got their way in life and they have to deal with what is front of them. I say that we give students the opportunity to be students and live their life as teens as much as they possibly can before they jump right into the real world. I believe that students should design their projects, but the teachers should approve. Compromising is a key factor in this. If people want the students to not have so much control over a project for school, teachers should be more open minded¬†and be able to at least give their students a choice of enjoyable projects for the students to work on over break. Even then, students still have some sort of choice of what they find pleasurable to work on over their free time and still end up getting a grade for the work that they have completed.  In conclusion, students should be able to design their project over the break because it is their personal time, some students learn different from others, and students should be able to do a project that they enjoy. Students are maturing as the days go by. If we don't give them some sort of authority as they grow up, they will not develop into adults that can handle the real world. Letting them have some sort of freedom or choice over what they want to do, will benefit them in the long run and not let them grow up so fast. Looking at this from a students point of view will give you an open mind about my position on this topic. Students should be able to feel a since of freedom when it comes tho their break and not feel stressed or pressured to do more school work during their time off.		0
Dear Principle,  Hi.  I am an eighth grader at your school.  And I am going to propose an opinion on whether or not the whole school should be required to do community service or not.  My answer will be supported with examples and other forms of evidence.  I think that you should not make everyone do community service.  There are plenty of people who should do it and people who cannot do it.  Many teens these days play sports and have families to attend to.  Although everyone SHOULD do it, doesn't mean they can do it.  I, for example, can't because of baseball.  I play in two different leagues and I am trying out for the school team.  There are many others who are just like me and just can't even if they wanted to.  The people that do have time to do it are doing good for our society and so it does not mean that everyone must contribute.  Also, if you think about it, a lot of teens, especially eighth graders, will not want to do it at all.  Teens these days just aren't caring for our economy, society, etc.  And if you do not listen to me and make everyone do it anyway, there will be protesters and you never know what they might do to get you to stop it.  It is great if people want to do it but like i said before, not everyone wants to or they just cannot have the time to help out.  Thank you for taking your time to read my (hopefully convincing) letter to you.  And that you please consider the possibilities of what might happen if you do go through with your plan.  Sincerely,  Eighth grade student,  STUDENT_NAME		0
Being able to learn from home should be a choice given to all students nationwide. Online classes can allow students to stay up to date in their classes. In many cases, some students miss school due to a countless number of reasons that result in them staying home. Whether it is because that student becomes sick or because that student is dealing with a personal situation, missing school can cause students to become confused in class. It is also proven that students have their own unique preference of how to learn. It could be taking online classes or video chatting with their teachers. If given the opportunity from their school, students would greatly benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because it will keep students well rounded.  Others may disagree with the idea that students attending class from home is beneficial. Some may argue that a student is not getting all the information needed for their class since¬†they are not actually in the classroom. At home, a student may be more distracted than he or she would be in a classroom. Due to the fact that there is more technology and freedom at home, a student can quickly get off task. Learning from home could also cause students to lose interaction with their classmates and teachers.  If a student misses school, he or she would be able to stay caught up in the curriculum because of attending class from home. In many instances, when a child is absent from class, that child falls way behind in the unit that is being taught. Confusion may arise while that child is in class the next day with no understanding about what is being taught. This can cause their grades to decrease because they are missing work and missing material. But if the student were to have a video conference with their teacher, there would be no risk of falling behind in class. Giving students a chance to learn from home would work in their favor.  By being home, away from all the noise a classroom often brings, students will be less distracted while learning. Most days in class, it is often too loud and rowdy for other students to learn. Surrounded by their peers, students can get easily distracted from what is being taught to them. Distance learning would allow students to focus in a peaceful environment while also getting the information needed without any setbacks. Students can focus solely on the teacher and the material being taught. Talking or getting in trouble would not be an option. Students will be able to learn at a place and time that is best for them.  Distance learning would allow flexibility within a students life and keep students up to date in their courses. It gives students the opportunity to learn in an environment that is comfortable for them. Without the distractions and without the possibility of falling behind, children will grow as better students. Due to these reasons,  I do believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.		0
The face that appers on mars is just a rock. I want to convience you that it's just a weird shape on mars. The shadows on the "Face" that shows the eyes, mouth, and nose is just plain shadows. According to the text "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shodows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." This explains how the face is really but from a far distance it's not what you think.  Even on websites, it shows just a normal landform. Something could look different from far away, then up close. Like in the story a group of people went in 1997, and they said it looked like it was an alien artifact. But a year later in1998, it was sharper then that passed year when they took the first picture.  This explains that the "Face" is really not a face, and that it wasn't created by aliens. It was just a simple rock with some shadows reflecting or illusions on the rock to make it look like a face. It was just a regular landform. 		0
I think that people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Think about all the great things that will come out of joining the Seagoing Cowboys, it is more than just an adventure.  One reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because you get to see different places along the way.  During one trip I had the benefit of being able to see Europe and China.  Also being able to see the Acropolis in Greece made it more special.  When you join this program you will see it as a opportunity, for me it was an unbelivable opportunity for a small-town boy like me.  Another reason to join this program is there is also sometimes where you get to have fun on board.  We would mostly have fun on our return trips after we had unloaded the animals. We would play baseball, volleyball and other stuff like fencing, boxing, and reading.  This program is not just taking care of animals you get time to entertain yourself and do somethings you want to do.  The last reason you should join this program is you might not just see it as an adventure but it gives you the opportunity to help others.  This adventure was more than adventure to me it opened my mind to the world around me.  This will make you aware of the people of other countries and their needs, this trip made me.  When you help these people it will make you feel special.  You should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program, It is an amazing experience. Think about you get to see new things, you get time for lot of fun on board, and you the special feeling of helping someone. I hope you will take time to think about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.       		0
Hey, Mr. Principal!  I'm here to convince you that students who have a B average or higher should be allowed to play sports and participate in activities. I know you're probably thinking, "But won't they get distracted from their studies?" or "What if they get injured and can't focus in class?" But let me tell you, having the opportunity to participate in sports and activities can actually help students achieve their goals, both academically and personally.  First of all, it's important to understand that trying hard and making good decisions go hand in hand. When students are involved in sports and activities, they learn how to set goals and work towards them. They also learn how to make sacrifices and prioritize their time, which can help them stay focused on their studies. In fact, studies have shown that students who participate in sports and activities tend to have better grades and higher graduation rates than those who don't.  But it's not just about academics. Participating in sports and activities can also help students develop important life skills, like teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. These skills can help them succeed in whatever they want to do in life, whether it's playing a sport professionally or starting a business. And let's not forget the social benefits! Being part of a team or club can help students make new friends and build a sense of community, which can be really hard to find in school.  Now, I know some of you might be thinking, "But what about the risk of injury? Won't students get hurt if they're playing sports?" And yes, it's true that there is a risk of injury when playing sports. But that's also true of any activity that involves risk, like driving a car or riding a bike. The important thing is to take safety precautions and make sure students are properly trained and equipped to handle the risks. And if they do get injured, they can still continue to participate in other activities, like cheering from the sidelines or volunteering in the school community.  In conclusion, allowing students who have a B average or higher to play sports and participate in activities can actually help them achieve their goals and become better students. It's not just		1
Seeking multiple opinions when making an important choice or decision can help someone make a better, more well-informed choice for a few key reasons:  First, getting perspectives from different people exposes you to a wider range of ideas, options, and factors to consider that you may not have thought of on your own. No single person can be expected to think of everything or anticipate all potential consequences of a choice. By talking to more people, you cast a wider net and are more likely to have an important consideration or two brought to your attention.   Secondly, various people may have had different types of relevant experiences that could provide useful insights. For example, if trying to choose between career paths, talking to someone established in each field can give you a clearer sense of the day-to-day realities of each path based on their experiences. Their input ensures you make your decision with a more robust understanding of what each option truly entails.  Thirdly, getting feedback from multiple trusted sources allows you to identify any common themes or patterns in the advice. If most people you speak to warn against a particular option or emphasize certain pros and cons, that consistency can indicate those factors are important to seriously weigh. Conversely, if different people have diverging views on a choice, that lack of consensus may signal the decision does not have clear benefits to leverage and more deliberate consideration is needed.  Finally, seeking a variety of perspectives prevents you from getting tunnel vision or becoming overly swayed by a strongly held view of any one individual. Our biases can blind us to alternate ways of seeing a problem, so consulting others helps ensure many angles get examined to reach the choice most advantageous overall, rather than just from one limited lens. In this way, considering multiple opinions fosters a well-rounded decision-making process and conclusion.  In sum, gaining advice from more than one source exposes you to more information, experiences and viewpoints to create a fuller picture for evaluating your options. A diversity of input avoids oversight and helps guarantee important factors are not missed, leading to a final choice made with greater insight, understanding and confidence it is the most informed one possible.		1
Knowledge, due to our globalized and technologically advanced 21st-century world, is essentially universal. Anyone can go on the internet and view an abundance of research papers or musical compositions, and gain otherwise inaccessible intelligence from them. The intelligence capabilites of the internet should, and must be, spread to the younger generations. Giving students the ability to learn online from home is beneficial, as they are in a familiar environment where they can learn without fear, build their own structure around their education, and pursue their own individual interests.  Schools, in theory, are supposed to be safe, judgment-free environments. However, for certain students, that is far from the case. Hundreds of thousands of students around the world have been bullied or tormented in schools, and some have received such bad treatment that going to school is no longer a safe option for them. An online education would offer students who have experienced those situations a safe learning environment where they could feel comfortable. While it could be argued that online schools are not 'real schools' that offer a 'real education,'  those arguments are far from the truth. Online schools are just as, if not more, rigorous than regular schools. Students have to be generally self-reliant, as they do not always have a teacher at their beck and call to aid them. The lack of teacher-aid online students get builds practical skills, and prepares them for what life will be like when they are an adult.  Online schools could also provide health benefits to students by allowing them to structure their own time schedules for their education. In an online classroom, students can work at their own pace, and do not have to wake up in the early morning hours. This extra sleep gives students more focus, and helps them learn better. Students pursuing an online education could also take breaks when they need it, which gives them time to meditate or exercise, things that would improve their learning capabilities and their health. Some schools do offer breaks and recess to their students, and some argue that those breaks are enough, but that argument does not take into account that those breaks often stop once students reach high school. Students of all ages need the ability to move and give their minds a rest, especially high school¬†students, who are often under heavy pressure to get good grades for college. Online schools would allow those students time to decompress, which would overall improve both their mental health and decrease their stress-levels, allowing them to educationally flourish.  To be successful in this world, students need to have a variety of different creative skills, and online classes promote the development of them. In a regular school in environment, students are not always able to pursue their own interests. They are in school nearly seven hours a day, and go home with piles of homework to complete, which blocks them from pursuing the skills they want to learn. An online class allows students time to do the things they genuinely want to do. It gives students the time to learn how to cook, play a sport, paint, and just have fun as children. While regular schools do have cooking and art classes, as well as sports, they do not always allow the students to pursue the exact aspect of that skill they want to, as those classes and sports are structured around learning standards that have to be hit. Online classes would allow students the time to express their own creativity and uniqueness, giving them a creative outlet unlike any other.  All in all, online classes would be incredibly¬†beneficial for students. Students would receive a quality education in a healthier, less intimidating, and less stressful environment where they could pursue their own creative interests. Online classes are not a thing of the future, they are a thing of the here and the now. A thing that could, and would, give students all the tools they need to succeed in the world, all while allowing them the chance to be happy too.¬†		0
The bell had just gone off,students were rushing into the hallway. I stayed in the classroom waiting for everyone to leave so I wouldn't get sucked into the rushing stream that was the middle school hallway. Only after I knew it was safe did I leave. I walked down to the classroom ,happiness¬†filling my bones,as I stepped into the class room i knew I belonged¬†there these where my friends. I think that all people should participate in some type of extracurricular activity because I believe that,Getting students involved would help students to have something to look froward¬†to throughout the day, getting students involved¬†would help them make friends with people that share then same interest as them,and finale involving more student would help open so student up to a wide variety of new experiences.  The first reason is,Getting students involved would help students to have something to look froward¬†to throughout the day. Most students have nothing to look froward to in a normal school day other than little things such¬†as talking to your friends in between blocks or lunch,but with extracurricular activities they have something big to keep them going till the end of school. For many people,such as myself,school is a prison¬†without bars where your forced to learn stuff that you dont want to learn,but with extracurricular activities it feels like you get a choice in what you do.  The second reason is that, getting students involved¬†would help them make friends with people that share then same interest as them. Most student have a wide variety of friend with many different likes,hobbies,and personalty s¬†many of which you don't have in common .Sometimes you just need someone with the same hobbies as you to talk to and what better place to find one is at a extracurricular activity about what your hobbies is!  The third reason is,involving more students would help open students up to a wide variety of new experiences. Many students are not in extracurricular activities for a variety of reasons .Joining a extracurricular activity can lead to a lot of fun doing something you never thought you would enjoy for example the FFA you could join because you wanted to try it out and new thing you know your white water rafting with your new friend wondering why you didn't sign up before you did.  In conclusion,I believe that all students should join a extracurricular activity because Getting students involved would help students to have something to look froward¬†to throughout the day,getting students involved¬†would help them make friends with people that share then same interest as them,and involving more students would help open students up to a wide variety of new experiences.		0
When they got on Mars they realized that it looked like a human face and they wanted to know if it was left by an alien or something. In order for the face to be created by aliens we would have to know that they exist. We would have to actually know that aliens made the face on Mars, we would have to have evidence that they exist. In order to know that the face is a natural landform we would have to do a lot of research stating that maybe something or someone made the face. Scientist would have to make sure that it is a face and not something else. Scientist figured that is was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, the unusual shadows made it look like an Egyptiazn Pharaoh. They would have to do research to see if aliens left it there or if its something that someone or something left on Mars. In order to find out if it's a face they would have to make conclusions about what it may be. They figured that it did not have anything to do with aliens but they were not sure if it was true or not they wanted to know if alien marking were hidden by haze. 		0
According to research, students typically receive far more break time throughout the school year than non-student adults. A 3-4 week break in the summer offers students time to relax and recharge, but it can also put them behind in their academic studies when school re-starts. Similarly, a longer winter break may give students more time to prepare for upcoming exams, but some may neglect their studies over the holidays. Spring and fall breaks provide a nice balance between the short summer break and the longer winter break, giving students a week to rest and reset midway through the academic year.   Students who use the summer break to their advantage can set goals such as gaining professional experience by securing a full-time job or saving money for college. This helps them to prepare for the future, as well as establish a sense of responsibility and independence. This can in turn have a significant impact on their long-term success and the skills they gain over summer breaks can help to make them even more attractive to future employers.		1
Yes, it could be useful! It could be used to do a lot of good things. For example, we could use it to help us determine whether someone is lying or not during an interigation or in a court. However, in order or both of those to be accurate we would need to make some adjustments.  Nevertheless, the technology could be used to show how and when students in school become confused or bored with a subject, just like the author stated. It could also advance our understanding of how emotions work. The Mona Lisa, who we saw in the picture, looks like she has a weird cross between a smile and a frown. It is very fascinating how this all works. This can also tell us if celebrities and politicians are being truthful.  In conclusion, it could be very benifical to study this subject. It could further advance the science of the human face and emotions. Like the author said, who knew faces could reveal so much about our emotions.		0
Image you were having different emotions going through your body all at one time but you dont want anybody to know that you are feeling this way. Well there is a machine called the Facial Action Coding System it can detect different emotions that go through out a humans body.  The machine called the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students in a classroom because if a student is having all these different emotions going through their body and they dont know what to do about it, the machine could really help them with the problem. For example if a student is having the emotions of being happy, sad, angry, or even disgusted about something the machine could really help let someone know that the student is having these emotions going through their body. In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" it states "Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. This states the machine would know the emotions of humans and even paintings of someones face.  In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System it valuble for students in a classroom because the machine can send someone a signal about the student that is going through different emotions.                              		0
Letting go of cars is the next big thing treding here in the U.S to all the way in France. Cars have been one of mankinds great accomplishements and has risen since World War two. Although its has in some cases made our live "easier" its has also brought issues. Some of the reasons why we should start to let go of cars is because it will stop the gass emissions or popultion, there public transportation to fall back on, and it will help releave stress. There is going to come soem sort of trouble but there are also great advantages we shoud think about of liming car usage.  Starting off, liming the amount of cars is a good thing because of the fact that it helps stop gass emissions. Which is the gas waste and polution it brings adn destroys the enviorment we live in. In Pairs they have took an act on this by banning driving due to smog. They have put in a rule that states "on Mondays motorist with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their care at home or they would have to suffer a 22-ero fine($31)". The congestion was down a 60% in the capital of France, after five-days of intensiifying smog. The congestion from the smog that was produce was¬† because of the high rate of cars were leting out great amounts of gasses. This causes our air to be poluted and us to get sick.  Continuing, another great advantage in limiting care usage is because it means that we will be promoting public transportation. If we have soemthing that is provided for us that we know is going to help why don't we use it?. Public transportation is a lot cheaper than having a car of our own and it does the absolute same thing it gets us from one destination to the next. In soem place that I can't really find in the passage because my eyes are getting irritated and yeah I know I probably spelled that wrong but I am trying to improve. Now I have kind of lost my train of thought because I felt the need to say that, because if I someone here the most they'll say is go to the bathroom and splash some water of them. I actually do like this test not that bad I expected but there is some minner adjustment I think you should consider (if your even still reading this) like giving us a break ? at least a five minute one my eyes yeah you remeber that and siting for this gets me all tense. The stories needs some improvements I mean cars? I know I need to do a little better on these things but that's why im in school pluss this is a practise I think by the real one ill do better. I like to write (or in this case type ) I do but mostly about things that I can either relate to or expressing my self I mean come on aren't I doing good so far ? okay maybe not really but its cause im pretty bet, but next time trust me i'll do better. Also the fact that I miss the same periods these days keeps me from doing what I need to in that class and its a¬† class I need, sorry but just saying. I'm debating whether to contintue with this essay I think i'll just try.  In additon, stress is something that also comes with havign cars. The fact that there is so many cars they cause traffic jams, which causes us to be late to our destination and that brings a great amount of stress. Another is reaching that age were the younger genertation reach that age to get their licenses. It is known that teenagers have the highest amount of leading accidents. This brings griefs to families and if survied post tramatic stress.  In conclusion, Cars may have brought us some kind of accompishment but it has also caused some negative effects. Reasosn why we should think about the advanges of lemiting the car usage is because of the gas emissions, promote alternative transportation (public) and it releaves stress. What has been to be done by the amount of cars there are has a great affect on us. We should want to stop it before it get to late.    		0
If you have to have a B average to play in sports, activities, etc. I think it would be a great idea because the students that like to play sports and such will or would try to get there grade average up resulting in good grades and a higher G.P.A. If my hypothesis is true, then with better grades you could get chosen to go to a good college like Yale.  Sports is good for exercise and fitness. If students cant increase there grade average, this would result in problems in the future like lack of fitness. Also if students want to try out for a sport such as Football, Basketball, etc, they cant. This would result in emotional behavior.  What i would like to ask the principal is "What is your proof that many students get a C grade average? what is the possibility of getting a C grade average?"  What i think should happen is that they should try this policy out for a year or two and see what happens, If students grade average goes up, down, or stays similar and then move on to keep the policy or to dismiss it.		0
Dear Senator, The topic of the Electoral college is a hot one, and the idea of whether of not to adjust it is controversial. Many citizen disagree with the process while many are in favor. What should we do? We should change the Electoral College. The voting is based more on quantity instead of quality, and the voting is not coming from the citizen's directly, making the risk of an unfaithful candidate too high and the actual voting less popular and more electoral. When one stateor even one person could change the whole ball game that is the Presidential Election, then what does that mean for our democracy?  While many will argue that it is a fair way to vote, the Electoral College has many flaws. First off, the candidates are focusing on more power and higher tallying states to get them through the election than everyone as a whole. For example, if you were a presidential candidate would you spend more time trying to sway California, with its whopping 55 electoral votes, or montana, with a teeny tiny 3 electoral votes? The candidates are not being considerate of ALL the American citizens, but instead the ones that they think will lead them to victory. This is not what the election is all about. The election is more focused on the popular vote of few states with many inhabitants than it is on many states with few citizens.  "Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." As stated in "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses are wrong" . Being that this true, why do we call it the "Presidential Election" instead of the "Electors Election?" Electors claim to be faithful to their candidates but sometimes this is not the case. If a member of the group is unfaithful to their candidate, it could unsettle the whole election, meaning that the United States as a whole would have to pay for the electors actions. This is not how voting was meant to be. Our slogan is "We the People," not "We the Electors." Now, I know what you're thinking, "Why would we change this system? It is already established and has worked for many years." In order to move forward as a nation we as a whole need to make changes sometimes. Just think what it would be like today if segregationan established rule and law was not questioned. Or even if the settlers of the United States had not questioned our former mother country and broke away. We would not even be the establishment we are today if we did not question established rules or traditions. The Electoral College is nothing more than a system that needs to be reevaluated, putting the popularity if the candidate in clearer perspective.  To recap, The Electoral College does not include the popularity of the candidates over official influences. The states are not being counted equally and electors control the electon overall. In order to have a more successful government and a more included population, the Electoral College simply needs to be reevaluated and changed to meet the popularity standards of our country if we are to ever advance.		0
 Participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program was one of the most exciting and rewarding experiences of my life. As a cowboy who rode the waves, I had the opportunity to travel to new places, meet interesting people, and learn about different cultures.  One of the main reasons I decided to join the program was to experience the adventure of a lifetime. As a Seagoing Cowboy, I was able to visit unique places that I never could have seen otherwise. From the beautiful beaches of Hawaii to the bustling cities of Japan, I was able to explore new and exciting places.  Another reason I enjoyed the Seagoing Cowboys program was the opportunity to meet new people and make new friends. As I traveled from place to place, I was able to connect with people from all over the world. From fellow cowboys to locals, I was able to learn about different cultures and form lasting friendships.  Participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program was also a great way to give back. As we delivered much-needed livestock to communities in need, I was able to make a difference in the lives of others. The gratitude and appreciation that I received from the people we helped made the experience even more rewarding.  Overall, my participation in the Seagoing Cowboys program was an unforgettable experience. If you're looking for an adventure of a lifetime, the opportunity to make new friends, and a way to give back, I highly recommend joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. You won't regret it!		1
The power to choose who is our president and who is not should be left up to the people. I belive that we cannot allow a system to decide who is president. You could even say its a sham we are told to vote for a presidential canidate yet we not even voting for them. Were voting for a set a electors and hoping that it will swing in our votes favor. The president should be elected by popular vote because we dont have a say and it is not practical.  You are told that you should go out and vote a president but your really voting for electors. when you go to vote you dont even get to see the elctors your voting for. This shouldent be allowed because the presidential canidates are the one running the camipaigns and publicity but we know nothing of the electors using the electoral collage to elect a president. Another downside to not being able to elect a president by popular vote is that the popular voted canidate can still lose due to having less electoral votes and this has happend before. Also this form of voting is not practical because in the end the people werent the deciding factor because the electoral vote is such a large one  In conclusion the way that we elect our presidents needs to change. The popular vote is a way to insure that people are getting there say in who is president. If the people see somthing wrong with a presidental canidate the peole should be able to put a stop to that and not have the chance of being overuled. The electoral college was created as a compromise it should be kept as a way to make a decision when there is no popular vote.    		0
## Limiting Car Usage: The Advantages  In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This is due to a number of factors, including the environmental impact of cars, the cost of owning and operating a car, and the health risks associated with driving.  There are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. First, it can help to reduce air pollution. Cars are a major source of air pollution, which can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Limiting car usage can help to improve air quality and reduce the risk of these health problems.  Second, limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can waste time and money. Limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion and make it easier to get around.  Third, limiting car usage can help to save money. The cost of owning and operating a car can be high, including the cost of the car itself, insurance, gas, and parking. Limiting car usage can help to reduce these costs.  Fourth, limiting car usage can help to improve public health. Walking and biking are healthy activities, and they can help to reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, and stroke. Limiting car usage can encourage people to walk and bike more, which can improve their health.  Fifth, limiting car usage can help to reduce noise pollution. Cars are a major source of noise pollution, which can be disruptive and stressful. Limiting car usage can help to reduce noise pollution and make it easier to enjoy a quiet environment.  There are a number of ways to limit car usage. One way is to live in a walkable or bikeable neighborhood. This means that you can easily walk or bike to your destination, rather than driving. Another way to limit car usage is to take public transportation. This can be a more affordable and environmentally friendly option than driving. You can also carpool or take a ride-sharing service. These options can help to reduce the number of cars on the road.  Limiting car usage has a number of advantages. It can help to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, save money, improve public health, and reduce noise pollution. There are a number of ways to limit car usage, such as living in a walkable or bikeable neighborhood, taking public transportation, carpooling, or taking a ride-sharing service. If you are looking for ways to reduce your environmental impact and save money, limiting car usage is a great option.		1
Cell phones have not been around for a long time but, they have become an important factor of our lives. People use their cell phones for everything like texting, talking, event planning, social media, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at a time. Sadly, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they're driving. Holding your phone in your hand while driving is dangerous to the for many of reasons.  When it goes off whenever they're driving whether it's a text, social media or a call, curiosity gets the best of them and they feel as if they have to look at that very moment. To stop and read this message you would have to take your eyes off of the road longer than the time of the one second, it takes to look at the rearview mirror. It is very dangerous to type or read while driving. It isn't safe on the road, so it is not just your own life you are risking.  I think that the use of a cell phone while driving should be banned in all states because it is already against the law in some states, it is a distraction to drivers. The use of cell phones, in all ways, while driving is already illegal in twelve states across the country. If someone is caught using their phone while driving, drivers may be faced with a ticket and a fine. The first California cell phone law bans any cell phone or wireless phone use while driving and if you are under the age of 18 you are banned from using a hands free device. The cell phone laws do not affect passengers of the vehicle; this law only applies to the driver of the vehicle.  Handheld cell phones can only be used if there is an emergency. Cell Phones and Driving In today's society we've all become attached to our cell phones. it does not matter how good you are at multitasking, it should be banned and against the law.  First with texts, social media and any written phone alert.  Cell phones make our lives easier in many ways we can check our email, receive phone calls, send text messages, listen to music, and take pictures, all at our fingertips. With all this convenience, however there is a dangerous side to cell phones, and that's when we use them while driving. Five states plus Washington D.C. have put hand held bans on cell phones while driving.            		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  Since you were deciding if all student should do community service. Well I think you are right because student should tutor elementary students or help clean litter. For example if an elementary school need tutor students either in the middle school or high school student should volunteer but the student don't want to help. Also what if you need more people to help clean the school because the custodian are in there day off but you don't know who can help you but some volunteer like student but they don't want to help. What if you begged the administration if the school can volunteer on helping on anything if possible. Then the school have something they can help on but student don't want to volunteer. So TEACHER_NAME please put that requirement on the student that they need to do community service thank you for reading this letter and I hope you do the right decision.  Sincerely,  Student STUDENT_NAME		0
There are many different plants in our solar system. You may have a favorite one or maybe you're just not that interested in it. Well have you ever thought about taking a trip to the moon or just the planet period maybe even studying a planet just for fun? It will cause you to think about the 5 w's first the who, who will be there are there lots of humans just floating around in space? what will it be like, what would it look like? Why did someone create this?  when did everything take place? Why did it take place? Where did everything all begin And what made someone think of this ?  Let's say you studied Venus. Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planted in our solar system. It could be by far the most exiciting plant that you could ever study and the greatest dangerous one too. Beyond high pressure and heat Venus geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. Venus causes many things to corrupt without venus there would be many corruptions in the world. But so does any other planet right? Not every planet is a good planet.  How is Venus tested and when was it discorved ? According to the text," Many astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planted in our solar system" The text also states that " Long ago, Venus was probably covered largelt with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. " Different plantes have been here for over 1,000 years crazy right, If you was to imagine what life would be like with out planets or gravity keeping everything in check what would we be up to right now. We need these things to survive.  Venus could be the most by far dangerous planet to visit the text says ," Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere". The text also states that, " On the plantet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." This goes to show that if you were able to take a trip to Venus you probaly would pass out or either die because the tempature is not average compared to the Earth's and there's less oxygen.  You might take it into concederation that we should not be limited to on things we want to do just because the danger of things, and I agree because the world be so much better if we did what we wanted. Studying a planet and actually going to see about it could be someone's biggest dream but they are stopped by it because of the outcome. Many people say chase your dream but how if we stuck in the same mind frame as everyone else.      		0
Ummm... hey there!  So, umm... I think I'm gonna choose my buddy, Jake, as the student who's struggling academically.  He's a really cool dude, but he's been having a tough time keeping up with his schoolwork lately.  I think he's got a lot of potential, but he just needs a little push to get him back on track.   Okay, so here's my plan for Jake:  Step 1: Have a chat with him!  I'll sit down with him during lunch or after school and talk to him about how he's feeling. I'll ask him if he's feeling overwhelmed or if there's anything that's distracting him from his schoolwork.  I want to make sure he feels comfortable talking to me, you know?   Step 2: Encourage him to join a club or sports team!  I think this will help him meet new people and make friends who share similar interests.  And, you know, it's a great way for him to get some exercise and have fun while doing it!  Plus, it'll give him something to focus on other than his schoolwork, you know?   Step 3: Offer to help him stay organized!  I'll show him some apps or tools that can help him keep track of his assignments and due dates.  And, umm... I'll even offer to help him study for tests and quizzes!  I know he's got a lot on his plate, so I want to make sure he doesn't feel overwhelmed.   Step 4: Be a buddy!  I'll make sure to sit with him during lunch or during class, and I'll ask him how he's doing.  I want to make sure he knows he's not alone, you know?  And, umm... I'll		1
In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author balances the pros and cons of exploring the planet Venus to boost the human race scientifically. The author expresses that Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, making it realistic for life forms to inhabit the planet. That is, if they can handle the heat. The exploration of Venus is something modern scientists should engage in due to the potential technical advances the population can make because of the information on the living conditions the average biotic being would endure on Venus.  The knowledge scientists have the ability to gain from Venus can only bnefit us. Even the simplest efforts to explore the planet will leave us with more determination to continue exploring and feed us information crucial to the succession of the human race. Analyzing the atmosphere further can encourage adaptation and give us options of migration when our sun, inevitably, blows up. There being "Many researchers... working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus," already proves the exploration to be something legitimate and worthwhile.  The risks being taken by choosing to explore Venus entertains the idea that the human race is diligent, curious, and selfless. The cause being fought for is for the benefit of future genertions of humans. With current and future technology, Venus' exploration will seem very realistic and encouraged by scientists with the same goals, giving the population a future.		0
 Positive Attitude: Agree or Disagree  Positive attitude is a crucial component of success and happiness in life. It's the belief that you are capable of achieving great things, and that your efforts are worth it. This mindset can help you overcome obstacles and achieve your goals. In this essay, I will argue that positive attitude is essential for success and happiness, and provide some examples to support my argument.  First, having a positive attitude can help you achieve your goals. When you believe in yourself and your abilities, you are more likely to put in the effort and persist through setbacks. For example, imagine a student who is struggling in a difficult class. If they have a positive attitude, they will believe that they can improve and achieve an A. They will put in the time and effort to study, ask questions, and seek help from their teacher. On the other hand, if they have a negative attitude, they may give up and accept failure, even though they could have succeeded with some effort.  Second, positive attitude can help you work well with others. When you have a positive attitude, you are more likely to be optimistic, friendly, and supportive. This can help you build strong relationships with others and work effectively in teams. For example, imagine a sports team that is struggling to win games. If they have a positive attitude, they will believe that they can improve and work together to achieve their goals. They will support each other, communicate effectively, and make adjustments as needed. On the other hand, if they have a negative attitude, they may blame each other, give up easily, and fail to work together effectively.  Finally, positive attitude can help you stay motivated and focused on your goals. When you believe in yourself and your abilities, you are more likely to stay motivated and committed to your goals. You will also be more focused on your goals and less likely to get distracted by negative thoughts or external factors. For example, imagine a business owner who is trying to grow their company. If they have a positive attitude, they will believe that they can achieve their goals and will take action to make it happen. They will be more focused on their goals and less likely to get discouraged by setbacks or failures. On the other hand, if they have a negative attitude, they may give up easily, become discouraged, and fail to achieve their goals.  In		1
As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to write about the potential benefits and disadvantages of a four-day school week! üéâ  First of all, let's talk about the benefits. If we have a four-day school week, we'll have more time to focus on our studies and extracurricular activities. For example, if we have an extra two hours in the day, we could have more time to work on projects or do homework without feeling rushed. Plus, it'll be easier for students who have part-time jobs or other commitments to balance their schedules. According to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics, students who have more time to focus on their studies tend to perform better academically. üìö  But, there are also some potential disadvantages to consider. One of the biggest concerns is that students might not get enough sleep if they're in school for longer periods of time. Sleep is super important for our brains and bodies, and if we don't get enough, we might feel tired and grumpy during the day. Plus, if we're in school longer, we might have less time to spend with our families or do things we enjoy outside of school. üõã ?  Another thing to think about is that extending the school day could be difficult for some families to manage. For example, if parents have to take time off work to take their kids to and from school, it could be hard for them to make ends meet. And, if students have to take public transportation, it could be hard for them to get to and from school safely. According to a report by the National Education Association, some families might not have access to reliable transportation, which could make it hard for them to take advantage of a four-day school week. üöå  In my opinion, the benefits of a four-day school week outweigh the disadvantages. I think it's important for students to have enough time to focus on their studies and extracurricular activities, and I think it's important for families to have enough time to spend together. However, I also think it's important to make sure that families have access to reliable transportation and don't have to sacrifice too much time with their loved ones		1
I think there should be stronger privacy protections on social media. Nowadays, peoples are sharing to much personal information online and it's not safe. I mean, i've seen people postin' their full names, addresses, and even phone numbers! That's just askin' for trouble.  Also, peoples are postin' pictures and videos of themselves doin' things that they might regret later. Like, I've seen people postin' pictures of themselves drinkin' and partying, or even worse, postin' videos of themselves doin' somethin' illegal. That's just not smart.  And it's not just about peoples bein' careless with their own information. There's a lot of creeps and scammers out there who are tryin' to take advantage of people on social media. They might pose as someone you know and try to get you to give them personal information or even money. It's scary, man.  So, I think social media sites should have stronger privacy protections in place to protect people's personal information. They should have strict rules about what people can and can't post, and they should have better security measures to keep creeps and scammers out.  Like, for example, they could have a rule that you can't post personal information like your address or phone number. And they could have a system in place to flag and remove posts that violate that rule.  And also, they could have a feature that lets you control who can see your posts and information. Like, you could choose to only let your real friends see certain things, and not let strangers see anything. That would be tight.  In conclusion, stronger privacy protections on social media are definitely needed. Peoples are sharin' too much personal information and it's not safe. Social media sites should take responsibility for protectin' their users' privacy and keepin' them safe from creeps and scammers. It's the right thing to do. Word.		1
Growth is something that is essential for everyone. It is the process of developing and expanding one's abilities and knowledge. There are different ways that we can grow, but the most effective way is by working hard, having confidence, and doing something.  Working hard is a crucial element of growth. It requires dedication and commitment to achieve our goals. When we work hard, we push ourselves to our limits and discover new capabilities that we didn't know we had. For example, when I started learning how to play the guitar, I had to practice every day for hours. It was challenging, but the more I practiced, the better I became. Eventually, I was able to perform in front of an audience, which gave me a sense of accomplishment and confidence.  Having confidence is also essential for growth. It is the belief in oneself and one's abilities. When we have confidence, we are more likely to take risks and try new things. For example, when I wanted to start my own business, I had to believe in myself and my ideas. I had to have the confidence to take the leap and invest my time and resources into it. It was scary, but it paid off because my business is now successful.  Finally, doing something is the most effective way to grow. It requires taking action and putting in the effort to achieve our goals. When we do something, we learn from our mistakes and improve our skills. For example, when I wanted to improve my writing skills, I started writing every day. I read books, took classes, and sought feedback from others. It was hard work, but it paid off because my writing has improved significantly.  On the other hand, relying on doing nothing and expecting results is dangerous. It is easy to assume that success will come to us without effort. However, this mindset is not realistic because growth requires hard work, dedication, and commitment. When we don't put in the effort, we miss out on the opportunity to learn and improve.  In conclusion, growth is essential for everyone. The most effective way to grow is by working hard, having confidence, and doing something. These methods require dedication and commitment, but the results are worth it. It is dangerous to rely on doing nothing and expecting results because growth requires effort and hard work. By putting in the effort, we can achieve our goals and become better versions of		1
 Driverless cars are a topic that has been explored for many years now and they are becoming more and more popular as technology advances. They are vehicles that are designed to operate without a driver, and instead rely on a combination of sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to navigate roads and operate autonomously.   One of the main advantages of driverless cars is safety. Human error is the leading cause of traffic accidents and fatalities on the road. By removing the human driver, driverless cars can significantly reduce the number of accidents caused by driving under the influence, reckless driving, and distracted driving. Additionally, the sensors and cameras on driverless cars can detect obstacles and potential hazards that might not be visible to a human driver, allowing for safer operation in crowded or unpredictable traffic conditions.  Driverless cars can also improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. With the ability to communicate with each other and coordinate their movements, driverless cars can help to reduce the number of cars on the road as they can carry multiple passengers or make multiple trips in a single trip. This can help to reduce the amount of time people spend stuck in traffic, making their daily commute more efficient and less stressful.  In addition to safety and traffic flow, driverless cars may also offer greater convenience and mobility to individuals who currently face challenges accessing transportation. For example, people with disabilities, the elderly, or those who cannot drive may be able to use driverless cars to travel independently. Furthermore, driverless cars may be able to provide a more comfortable and peaceful ride, as passengers can relax and enjoy the journey without worrying about driving or navigating through traffic.  However, there are still some concerns about the safety and reliability of driverless cars. Autonomous technology is still evolving, and there have been some recent high-profile accidents involving self-driving cars. This has raised questions about the ability of technology to reliably detect and respond to potential hazards on the road.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel and improve road safety. With their ability to operate autonomously, they could reduce accidents caused by human error and improve traffic flow. However, there are still challenges to overcome regarding the safety and reliability of the technology, and further research and development is needed. Ultimately, the benefits of driverless cars will depend on how well these challenges are addressed and whether or not the technology is able to live up to its potential.		1
Dear Principal,  The students of our school think that this policy is not fair. We think that we should have a D or F average to stop participating in school sports and other activities. We, the students, agree that if because of certain reasons grades are slipping, we will work to keep our grades up to continue with the sport or activity we participate in . If our grades are a B- and up we will continue to keep our grades up and be good students. Students with a C average will continue to work hard, study, and make better grades instead of taking the risk of letting grades slip.  Certain sports may be hard to work school around. For example football is a very important sport at our school and the players work hard at practice, they will continue to work around practice and get all their study time in to make the grades and stay on the team. Your policy will continue to make the students work harder but it is to fair to many. Some may have a C average but they may be working as hard as the others who have an A average. Some may not be able to understand the curriculum. This will change the student body drastically.  In conclusion the policy of only allowing students with a  B average join sports and other activities will not allow students to play certain sports and participate in clubs and other activities that they are interested in. We will be glad if you would continue with the current policy. We would hope that this helped you view our opinion on this topic.  Thank You  Sincerely,  Your Students		0
The use of cars around the world are having an impact on the envoirnment today.¬† Being able to limit the use of cars would be benifical to your wellbeing and the enviornment.  In Vauban, Germany there is a suburb that doesn't have any cars. People are allowed to own cars but there are only two places to park, which are the two large garages at the edge of the development. Also the owner must pay $40,000 for a space, along with a home. The majority of the residents do not own cars and say they are happier this way. This community is an example that is trending throughout Europe, and is trying to kick start a movement called "smart planning". "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"(Rosenthal 5). The air is becoming very polluted and there are efforts being made to try and fix the issue.  In Paris, there was a day of near-record pollution. They decided to enforce a law banning certain cars on certain days to try and help clear the air. On Modays, people with even-numbered licence plates had to leave there cars at home or pay a fine of 22-euro or $31. About 4,000 people were fined that day. The congestion was down 60% in paris as well, and the smo cleared up enough monday for the French to decide on the banning of odd-numbered plates on Tuesday also.  Aslo in Bogota, Colombia there is a day without cars. There goal is to promotes alternative transportation and reduce the amount of smog. Anyone who violated this law was fined $25. " It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said buisinessman¬† Carlos Arturo Plaza(selsky 24). This trend is spreading, with other Colombian cites joining the event.  The end of car culture is among us in the United States. Studies have shown that people are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licences as the years go by. The number of miles driven in the United states peaked in 2005 and is steadily dropping . As of April 2013, that number has dropped by about 9% and is equal to where the United states was in January 1995. The new generation are not finding drivin or even etting a licence a priorty anymore. They plan there work and social life by were they can walk or use a alternative¬† transportation. Bills are being made to help with the amount of pollution made by cars and are trying to gie the people more opportunities to use alternative transportations.  The amount of pollution created by cars are effecting our envoirnment. As shown in the example of paris, that by limiting the amount of cars o the road you can prevent some of the air pollution increasing the quaility of the air. Also not having to worry about driving has decreased stress in some cases. Overall limiting car usage would be beneficial to your wellbeing and the enviornment.    		0
Dear Principal Smith,  I am writing to respectfully share my thoughts on the school's cell phone policy options under consideration. Of the two choices, I believe Policy 1 is the better approach for our students and school.   Allowing phones during select times, like lunch and free periods, recognizes that cell phones are part of everyday life for students. Banning them completely could feel overly restrictive and may even lead to some students hiding phone use. Policy 1 sets clear limits by only permitting phones when they are least disruptive to the learning environment.   During lunch, phones offer a way for students to connect with friends, family, activities and interests outside of school. They help the lunch hour feel less like a break between classes and more like a social period. Trusting students to use phones respectfully in this setting may improve their sense of independence and responsibility.  Phones can also be educational tools when used appropriately. Some students may want to look up topics discussed in classes, check schedules or assignments, or use educational apps‚Äîif phones are banned, these beneficial uses are not possible. Policy 1 balancesphone use with limits to minimize distraction during lessons.   Overall, a limited phone use policy treats high schoolers more like the young adults they are becoming. It empowers them with some independence over their technology while still prioritizing learning during instructional time. For these reasons, I believe Policy 1 is the wisest path forward for students and our school community. Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, [Your name]		1
It's the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, can you guess what it is? It's election day! Every four years, nearly every person in America will vote to choose a new President, or do we? Yes, we live in a democracy where we can vote for who runs out country, but do we really make the decision? The Electoral College is a phase where electors, of a candidate running for president, come together and decide for who is the President, Vice President, and include the counting of the electoral votes from Congress. The person who runs for President has a select group of people known as electors, which are typically chosen by that person's political party. Is this who we really vote for, and is it fair? This should be eradicated.  By using the Electoral College, we don't directly vote for our own President. We vote for fisher's electors. It's them who really choose who leads us, not us! In "What Is the Electoral College?" it states that "...when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors," meaning we aren't actually voting for a President, just fisher's electors. It could literally be anybody, not holding public office. This is not a direct way for us to vote for who makes the decisions around here. In "Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong," it claims that "...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now." Sixty percent said that! That's incredible.  The electoral votes are just unequal. The states that are bigger would obviously get more electoral votes than, let's say Maryland. California would have more votes than Maryland because it i smuch bigger. The House of Represenatives has its own unique way of handling that, and they're going just fine, we don't need another. It just isn't reliable, the numbers and percentages would be all boggled up. This country is based on equality and liberty. and there is no equality in this.  The Electoral College is much too confusing. Sometimes voters could be discombabulated about who it is they are voting for. Sometimes voters can't control who the electors vote for. This is both confusing and frustrating for anyone who thinks they voted for someone great, but the electors change that. In "Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong," it says that "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.", meaning that we don't choose for ourselves, they do.  Some could say "its anarchy", or that "its not democratic", which could be true. In "In defense of the Electoral College...," it states that "But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee...however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote." This means that even though you vote for a person, it's probably a fiftyfifty chance your person will win. It does also help release the stress of worrying about a runoff election, and avoids the problem where no candidate receives a majority of votes that has been cast.  The Electoral College is not the best way to vote in our beautiful country. It can be decieving and confusing. Though it may have one or two advantages, the list of things that can go wrong with it are of plenty. It is unfair, and could turn nasty. It should be abolished. Make America more equal.		0
Extracurricular. Many people think that extracurricular are unnecessary or that they are a waste of time, but on the contrary, they are very beneficial to students. Whether its participating in sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council, students should be a part of them. So when I heard that the principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity I, of course, said that I agree and you should too. To me, the fact that people think extracurricular are a waste of time is absolutely ridiculous. Extracurricular can help students make new friends and improve their social skills, learn new things while being more activity, and last but not least, be beneficial¬†for any type of future applications.  Making new friends and improving social skills is a huge factor that supports the fact that extracurricular are important. By participating in at least one after school activity, students are sure to meet new people, and with that, make new friends. For example, say a student is participating in an after school activity; there they would meet tons of new people, and overtime, that would be beneficial to them. The student will slowly become friends with the other students in that particular activity, whether its a sport or a club. Fellow peers would share their views on things and discuss things relating to the activity and the student would cooperatively listen and contribute, improving their communication skills as well. Being in after school activities are not just fun, but crucial for students' social skills, and lets face it, no one wants to be alone, and extracurriculars help with that  Another way extracurriculars are important is because students can learn new thing and be more active. This is one of the main reasons why I support this new decision the principal has taken. While students already learn in school, I think that's not enough. They should still continue their learning outside of school, even if its not¬†academic based. They could learn new things about the sport they're playing, or if they are taking art classes, learn about how to blend colors. It doesn't matter what the student learns, as long as they are learning something, it's still beneficial to them, and they could apply that knowledge anywhere. Being in at least one after school thing would also make the student more active, physically and mentally. Sports would make them more physically¬†active, and if they are a part of an activity that requires critical think, then they would essentially be strengthening their brain power.  Future applications are also deeply affected by if a student was in an extracurricular or not. High school applications, college applications, job applications, it doesn't matter, they are all affected by extracurriculars. These types of applications are always looking for if the student, or future employee, is well rounded. Well rounded means that besides academics, the student participated in after school things. This is exactly what the principal is trying to do, and it makes sense. If a student applied to a high school, for example, and they barely participated in any after school activites, their chances of getting in would be very low compared to a student who participated in multiple things. Many students have dreams of getting into big high schools and colleges, getting their dream job, etc. But thats not possible if their participation in extracurriculars is low, which is why a student must participate in at least one, and then slowly over time, they would participate in more.  Helping students make new friends and improving their social skills, learning new things while being more active, and beneficial for future applications are all reasons that prove extracurriculars are crucial. By being in extracurriculars, students can meet new people and make new friends, improving their social skills. They can learn new things; no matter what the topic is, sports or clubs, they would still be learning. Future applications depend on extracurriculars too. Participating in them can greatly strengthen your application, helping you in return.  All these reasons are why I support the principles' new decision of making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity, and after reading this, you should too.		0
 As a scientist at NASA, I have been personally involved in several missions dedicated to studying the planet Mars and its many geological features. One of the most intriguing and puzzling features on Mars is the Face, a peculiar formation that resembles a human face. However, despite the popular belief that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, it is important to consider the evidence that suggests that this feature is actually a natural landform. In this essay, I will provide and examine the claims and evidence from the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' to convince someone that the Face is simply a natural feature of the planet.  Firstly, it is important to note that the Face on Mars has been known to scientists for decades. According to the article, the first photograph of the Face was taken by the Mars Exploration Rover, Spirit, in 2006. Since then, several subsequent missions have been devoted to studying this remarkable feature. The Face is located on Phobos, a moon of Mars, and is approximately 4 miles wide. It is characterized by a series of ridges, valleys, and what appears to be a central nose-like feature.  One of the key pieces of evidence in support of the idea that the Face is a natural landform is the presence of other similar features on Mars. The article notes that there are several other formations across the planet that resemble the Face, including the Asyla and Chasma 4 regions. These formations are all known to be erosional features that have been created by geological processes.  Another indication that the Face is a natural landform is its presence in a region that has been known to be subject to intense geological activity. Phobos, the moon where the Face is located, has experienced a significant amount of volcanic and tectonic activity in the past, with evidence of ancient lava flows and impact craters. The region of the Face is characterized by several of these features, which support the idea that it may have been created by these geological processes.  Lastly, the Face is aligned with several other features on Mars that are known to be connected to geological activity. For example, the article notes that the Face is located near to several large impact craters, which suggests that it may have been created by the impact of meteorites or other space debris. Additionally, the Face is aligned with several key geological features on Mars, including the Caloris basin and several major mountains, which could suggest that it is part of a larger geological system.  In conclusion, while the Face on Mars may be a fascinating and mysterious formation for many people, it is clear that there is evidence to support the idea that it is a natural landform. Its presence in regions with known geological activity and its alignment with other key geological features on Mars all suggest that it was created by natural geological processes rather than by extraterrestrial activity. As scientists continue to study the Face on Mars and the surrounding region, we can hope to gain a better understanding of how this remarkable feature formed and what other geological mysteries await us on this exciting planet.		1
Driveless cars is not a smart idea. Its a posiablity that the so called "Smart Car" could malfuncition while someone is in it and cause a crash or even death to the passangers.  Yes, its true that there are cars now that can break one their own, warn the driver if something is in close contact and more. How ever, the entire time there is a driver in control at ALL TIMES. There is not a moment where the car alone is moving. Another reason driveless cars is not a wise desision is that its illegal to even test drive one in many places. For exsample; Califorina, Nevada Florida, and the District of Colimbia. Alose, law makers know that saftey is best achived with alert drivers.  Smart cars are not so smart. They in danger lives with un-foced drivers, and are not even ligel everywhere. Humans are not ready for such an advanced way of transpertation quite yet. Possiably in the future, but as of right now that would be a no to smart car techonolgy.		0
Most people think extracurricular activities are helpful. It is a possibility, if helpful suddenly equaled to a broken leg or a tired brain. However, these issues seem to currently be rendered as unhelpful. This is why extracurricular activities should remain strictly optional.  Extracurricular activities take up too much time. A study at the Florida School of Psychology shows that 35% more students who participated in an extracurricular activity failed to turn in an assignment on time compared to those who did not, simply because they did not have the time to complete it. Now, this may not seem like a lot, but think of how many assignments that might be missed under normal circumstances. An analyzation of school records show that 23% of assignments are normally missed. That is 58% of assignments missed on average students. Think of the grades.  Those who participate in extracurricular activities are at risk of injury. Studies prove that students who participate in sports tend to get more concussions and broken limbs than those who do not. Not to forget those in photography. Their technology might be damaging if not used correctly, with the proper safety precautions. All in all, if those in extracurricular activities are getting hurt, then why continue with the extracurricular activities in the first place?  Extracurricular activities are tiring, to put it lightly. Falling asleep in class can pose a danger to grades, especially those in honors classes, dual enrollment, AP, the classes in which the content moves so quickly that a sleeping student might miss an important part of the lesson. Missing an important part of the lesson condemns the student to a bad grade on any important assignment possibly containing that crucial piece of information.  "Extracurricular activities are entertaining to those who choose to participate," opponents argue. An astute observation, yes, but the phrase '  those who choose to participate  ' is not supporting their side, rather, it supports mine. An activity becomes rather less enjoyable when forced into it. Studies show that students who had their activities chosen for them experienced lower levels of endorphins than those who could choose which activities to participate in, and much less than those who could choose whether or not they participate. Students tend to be happier when they have the freedom to pick and choose, rather than being picked and chosen for.  So why continue with the extracurriculars? Why continue with the tiring, dangerous, time consuming, extracurriculars? The darkest crime of all is not giving people the choice of whether to continue forth or stay behind. So unless you have good reason for not giving students the freedom they deserve, you deserve everything that comes for it.		0
Generic_Name woke up with a churning feeling in her stomach. She still didn't know whether she should cut off her toxic friend Generic_Name or not. She picked up her phone and read the text from Generic_Name. It read, "Hey ugly. You better not wear that hideous green shirt of yours today. I'm wearing my green dress and I don't want people to think we're matching." Generic_Name sighed and just ignored the text. She decided to text her friend Generic_Name, who is also friends with Generic_Name, and ask her what to do. The text read, "Hey Generic_Name, Generic_Name has been really mean to me recently and I dont know if I should stop talking to her or if I'm just being dramatic. Please help." Generic_Name responded, "Stop being so sensitive! Don't ruin the friend group with your petty drama and just let it go." Generic_Name didn't expect this reaction and she still wasn't sure if she should continue being friends with Generic_Name but she didn't really have another option. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because one person could know more about the situation, someone could have gone through something similar, and you could see how different people react to the problem.  The first reason I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that one person could know more about the situation than others. For example, let's say that Generic_Name decided to ask her friend Generic_Name, who was also friends with Generic_Name, what to do. Generic_Name would probably inform Generic_Name that Generic_Name was talking bad about her behind her back and spreading rumors about her. This new information could help Generic_Name make the right choice about how to deal with the situation. Another example is if you want to buy your best friend a gift for her birthday but you don't know what to get her. You decide to ask your friends to help you pick a present and they don't know what to get her either, so you decide to ask her boyfriend what you should get her and he tells you that she told him that she wanted to take a trip to the spa. Then you would know what to get your friend because you asked someone else who knew more about the situation.  The next reason I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is someone you ask could have gone through something similar and know what to do about the situation. Let's say Generic_Name was still unsure about what to do about her toxic friend, she could ask her old friend Generic_Name, who stopped talking to Generic_Name a while ago, what to do. Generic_Name knew that Generic_Name used to playfully make fun of Generic_Name but then one day Generic_Name just left the group. Generic_Name could tell Generic_Name that she went through the same thing and she just couldn't take it anymore and she had to leave that situation. This information could help Generic_Name make a choice because she now knows that Generic_Name has treated her friends like this in the past and that she is not just being sensitive. Another example is if you want to adopt a new pet but you don't know if you should adopt a hamster or a bird, so you decide to ask your friend, who has a bird, if you would be a good bird owner. Your friend could tell you that having a pet bird takes a lot of time and you need to be able to give your birds the proper care and attention that they need. Whereas when you asked your friend who has a hamster if they need a lot of attention she said no because they are nocturnal .You know that you're a very busy person so with the information your friends gave you, you can make an educated decision to not get the bird.  Finally, I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can see different people's reaction's to the situation. For instance, in Generic_Name's situation she asked three of her friends what to do about her toxic friend Generic_Name. Two of her friends told her bad things about Generic_Name and gave Generic_Name more reasons to stop being her friend, whereas only one of her friends told her to keep being Generic_Name's friend. Since more people reacted the same way to the situation, Generic_Name now had a more informed opinion and a better idea of what to do. Another example is if you want to start a business selling jars filled with dirt and you ask your friends if you should. Your friends could give you different reactions to the idea. Four of them could say that it's a terrible business idea and two of them could tell you to go for it. Since more people felt that it was a bad idea you could rethink it and make a better decision in the end.  With Generic_Name's new information and advice from her real friends, she decided it would be best if she cut Generic_Name out of her life. She got out of bed and put on her green shirt and smiled. She thought to herself, "Generic_Name doesn't control my life or what I wear." When she got to school she walked passed Generic_Name in the hallway and didn't even look at her. "Hello!" shouted Generic_Name, "Didn't I tell you not to wear that? You look ugly in it. I was trying to save you from embarrassment." Generic_Name didn't even turn around to respond, she just kept walking as if Generic_Name didn't exist. She was happy that she decided to listen to Generic_Name and Generic_Name's advice and not just listen to the advice from Generic_Name. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because one person could know more about the situation, someone could have gone through something similar, and you could see how different people react to the problem.		0
Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! üòÖ For this essay, I'm gonna talk about how staying active can be super beneficial for us. üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ ?  First off, staying active can help us avoid boredom. üò¥ When we're active, we're not sitting around twiddling our thumbs, and we're more likely to find things to do that are fun and exciting. Like, I know I get bored sometimes when I'm just chillin' at home, but if I go for a run or play a sport, I feel way more energized and engaged. Plus, there are so many cool activities to try, like rock climbing or dance classes, that can keep us on our toes. ü§©  Another benefit of staying active is that it can help us live a healthy life. ü•ëü•ó When we're active, we're burning calories and staying fit, which can help us maintain a healthy weight and avoid diseases like diabetes and heart problems. And the best part is, you don't have to be a total gym rat to stay healthy  ?even just taking a walk or doing a quick workout at home can make a big difference. üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇ ?  Finally, staying active can help us achieve our goals. üéâ Whether it's getting better grades, making new friends, or just feeling more confident, staying active can give us the energy and motivation we need to reach our full potential. For example, I know some people who started playing a sport to improve their focus and concentration, and now they're doing way better in school! üìöüèÜ  So, in conclusion, staying active is super important for avoiding boredom, living a healthy life, and achieving our goals. üéâ It doesn't have to be hard or time-consuming  ?even just taking a short walk or doing a quick workout can make a big difference. üåü So, let's all try to		1
Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! üòÖ I'm super excited to write this essay about why knowledge is more important than imagination. I know, I know, it might seem like a weird topic, but hear me out! ü§î  First of all, let's talk about what knowledge is. Knowledge is like having all the facts and information about something. It's like having a superpower that helps you understand the world around you. Without knowledge, you wouldn't know how to do things like solve problems, make good decisions, or even communicate with others. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ ?Imagination, on the other hand, is like having a wild and creative mind. It's like being able to dream up all sorts of crazy and amazing things that don't exist in real life. üåü  But here's the thing: while imagination is cool and all, knowledge is way more important in the real world. Think about it! Without knowledge, you wouldn't be able to do things like build a house, grow food, or even fix a broken toy. üõ† ?You need knowledge to survive and thrive in the real world. üåü  For example, take the COVID-19 pandemic. Without the knowledge and information about the virus, we wouldn't have been able to develop vaccines or treatments to help stop it. üíâ And without the knowledge of how to properly wear masks and social distance, we wouldn't have been able to slow the spread of the virus. üö´  Another example is in science and technology. Scientists and inventors need knowledge of the world around them to create new things and solve problems. üî¨ Without knowledge of physics, chemistry, and other sciences, we wouldn't have things like computers, smartphones, or even electricity! üíªüí°  So, while imagination is definitely important for creativity and inspiration, knowledge is way more important for survival and success in the real world. üåüüí° So, the next time you're brainstorming ideas or solving a problem, remember: knowledge is power!		1
Most students don't enjoy getting projects assigned to them to complete over summer break. If students got the opportunity to design their own projects, it may be a more enjoyable experience for the student. Students tend to forget information they've learned during the school year once summer hits. A way a number of schools attempt to prevent this situation is simply assign projects for students to complete over break. Students should have the choice to design their own projects for summer break because they are more likely to complete a project on a topic they enjoy and they will have better time management.  There is a higher chance of students completing an assignment if they enjoy the topic the assignment is based on. When trying to complete a project students have no interest in, often times the motivation factor runs low. Low motivation tends to lead to unfinished projects. There is a greater chance students will complete a project they've self-designed because they will most likely be more interested and better engaged in the topic they have chosen for themselves. For example, like reading a book, a person that does not enjoy reading has a higher chance of enjoying a book if it is based upon a topic they are interested in.  With a self-designed project, students will obtain better time management. During the summer, many students tend to have a packed schedule. Therefore, causes students to not make time for projects assigned to them. Leading to why having students create their own project, follows with the task of the project being completed. Better time management has a great chance of leading to a completed project. For example, a student that is joyful about an assignment they have to¬†complete, will make time for the project. Students then will have no excuse on why they could¬†not¬†complete their projects because they have the ability to design it in a way that fits their schedule.  Overall, many students don't enjoy getting assigned projects to complete over summer break. With the opportunity of getting to design their own project, might change how students feel about getting assigned work to complete. Students should have the opportunity to create their own projects for summer break because there is a greater chance the student will complete a project on a topic they are interested in and they will posses better time management.¬†		0
 Driverless cars  Driverless cars, or autonomous vehicles, are cars that are designed to operate without the need for a driver. These cars are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer several advantages over traditional cars. One of the main advantages of driverless cars is that they can significantly reduce the number of accidents on the road. Unlike traditional cars, which are operated by humans and therefore prone to human error, driverless cars are controlled by computers and are free from human error. This means that they can detect and respond to dangerous situations on the road much faster than a human driver, reducing the risk of accidents.  Another advantage of driverless cars is that they can increase productivity. With a driverless car, passengers can continue to work, read, or relax while the car takes care of the driving. This means that commuters can use their commute time to get more done, and travelers can make better use of their time on long trips. Additionally, driverless cars can also reduce traffic congestion, as they are designed to communicate with each other and adjust their speed and route to avoid traffic jams.  Driverless cars also have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike traditional cars, which require a driver to operate the engine, driverless cars can operate more efficiently. They can adjust their speed and route to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Additionally, driverless cars can be designed to be more energy-efficient, with smaller engines and lightweight materials.  Despite the many advantages of driverless cars, there are also some concerns about their safety and effectiveness. Some people worry that driverless cars may be more prone to cyber attacks, and that hackers could potentially take control of the car and cause accidents. Additionally, there are concerns about the cost of driverless cars, as they may be more expensive than traditional cars.  In conclusion, driverless cars offer several advantages, including increased safety, productivity, and reduced emissions. While there are some concerns about their safety and cost, the benefits of driverless cars are significant and they are likely to become more common in the future. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see more and more cars on the road that are controlled by computers, rather than humans.		1
First of all to imform fellow citizens about the advantage of limited car usage.'' as a result,70 percernt of vaubans families do not own car and 57 percent sold a car to move here''.''Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs where middle- families from chicago to shanghai tend to make their home''.and '' passenger car are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe. and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive area in the united state''.  Second of all,''while there have been effort in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs. vauban,home to 5,500 resident within a rectangular square mile,may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life''.  Finally there are some county and city tht have higher cost of the gasoline and some county and city have lower cost but evrything it different in all the world. paris typically has more smog than other european capital.''president obama's ambitious goal to curb the united state greendhouse gas emissiom, unveiled las week,will get a fortuitous. that what i think advantage of limited car like i said every city and county are different and have different cost.    		0
Aren't you tired of the accidents that happens frequently on the road, getting stuck in traffic and not getting to work on time or any important event that you must attend, and also the air being polluted by the gas cause by the car that gets us sick? Do you think it would be a good idea if we limit the usage of the car?. When you limit car usage it makes the world safer, it save time and less injury will occur.  When the car usage is limited it save time. When more people are walking on foot or riding bicycle its less chance of traffic in the streets and people can get to where they are going much faster. More cars on the road means more traffic, more waiting and a much higher percentage of people¬† loosing their¬† jobs because of constantly being late for work. It is also beneficial because you dont have to keep buying gas to put in your car and you have to remember that the bigger your vehicle is, is the more gas it use. Dont you prefer saving your money to do other important things than worrying about paying insurance and buying gas? In my perspective i think it would work out great.  Air pollution is one of the biggest problem now not only in the United States but all around the world . The cars that are used on the road is what contributes to the pollution because the fuel from the car is what helps to pollute the air and pollution is what cause people to get sick. Based on the article cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. It also stated that Diesel was blamed for these actions since diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in countries like France and 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. In this case the less car usage the better it is for our health and the better it is also for our environment.  When the car usage increase is the more accident that will occur on the road. Alot of people now a days are very reckless and care free when it comes on to driving on the road especially teenagers. Teenagers are known for getting into alot more accidents than any other people mainly because they are the ones that party alot and are not cautious when it comes on to drugs and alchol. When the car usage is limited is the less accidents that will happen and it will be safer for people. Occurding to Mr. Sivak when he was growing up he was curious about the kind of car people drove, but young people don't really care. A car to them just means getting from point A to point B.  Others may argue that having a car is much easier and faster to carry you to your destination than walking, riding a bicycle or using public transportation. Evening though this may be true cars are not safer than walking and riding a bicycle and it is also cause alot of accidents and to remind you it helps contribute to the pollution. As stated in the article with all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habits. In other words the more people get use to walking and riding bicycles its going to harder for them to take up back the habit of having a car that takes them everywhere.  In conclusion when the car usage is limited its the less accidents that will occur. The better it is for your health because when you ride a bike or walk that is also exercising and exercising is good because it keeps your body fit and in shape and the less chance of people like elderly having muscle pains and nerve problems. It also help to save money, life and time and help people not to be lazy. In this case limiting car usage will help the world tremendously.       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†    		0
Ummm...okay!  Here's my essay on how problems can benefit people and help them in their lives:  Uh, so, problems.  Yeah, they can be, like, really tough and stuff. But, like, sometimes they can also be, like, good for us?  Like, yeah, I know it's hard to believe, but it's true!  First of all, problems can help us learn and grow.  Like, when we face a problem, we have to figure out a way to solve it, right? And sometimes, that means learning something new or trying a new approach. It's like, our brains are like muscles, and problems are like weights that we have to lift to get stronger.  And who doesn't want stronger brains?!  And problems can also help us appreciate things more.  Like, when things are going smoothly, it's easy to take them for granted. But when we face a problem, it makes us realize how much we actually need or want something. It's like, we start to value things more when we have to work for them.  It's like, the struggle is what makes life interesting, you know?  Plus, problems can help us connect with others.  When we're facing a problem, it's easy to feel like we're alone. But when we talk to others about our problems, we realize that everyone else is going through something too. It's like, we're all in this together, you know? And that's a pretty cool feeling.   And finally, problems can help us become better versions of ourselves.  Like, when we face a problem, it's easy to get discouraged or give up. But if we keep pushing through, we can learn to be more resilient and determined. It's like, we're training ourselves to be stronger and more resourceful.  And that's a skill that will help us in all areas of life.  So, yeah.  Problems		1
It would be impossible for the face to be created by aliens because new high image resolutions and 3D altimetry from  NASA's Mars global survey reveals the face on mars was really just a mesa. It also shows that its formed by shadows giving the the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos and shows that it was just anatural landfom. Their was no alien momument after all. The pictures also show that the landfrom is equivelent to mesas landforms that can alo be found in American West.  Also if u look at the three photos from viking 1 1976 and the one from 1998 and the latest image from 2001. The higher the resolution the more it doesnt look like a face. The 1976 photo its looks like a face. Then the 1998 photo it looks like nothing to me. But when you look at the 2001 phot it looks like hills with canyons or crakes near them. So you would have to give me a good reason and explanation how this looks like aliens created it. In conclusion tahts why i dont think it was created by aliens and its just a natural landform.            		0
A common misconception is that one can achieve more on their own than they can in a group setting. However, the ability to work productively with a group of individuals can result in more meaningful outcomes than attempting to go solo. By pooling together different experiences, knowledge and skills, a team has the potential to capitalize on strengths that a single person may not possess.   Working collectively enables us to learn from each other, identify new ideas and gain different perspectives. It creates the potential to engage and collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds, who can bring valuable experience and reasoned insights. Having a variety of perspectives can provide a well-rounded outlook and can help to motivate and inform one another.  Group work can increase the efficiency of a project. Working together allows for the division of labor, which can help reduce the workload and produce better quality results in a shorter period of time. Additionally, dividing tasks amongst members can help to reduce the stress associated with the project.  Although working together can come with its own set of challenges, such as managing interpersonal conflicts and ensuring that everyone's voices are heard, the benefits of collaboration far outweigh the challenges. By working together, we can reach new heights and accomplish far more than any one of us could have achieved on our own.		1
 A city council is considering the implementation of a 10pm weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. The question arises: does curfew help teenagers or not help teenagers? In my opinion, curfew is a bad idea, as it does not help teenagers on weekdays and weekends. My top three reasons for this are that teenagers stay out more, sink in/out of the house, and get in trouble.  When teenagers stay out more, it is often to hang out with friends. For example, my friends and I like to smoke and hang out. My curfew was 11pm, and I didn't check the time until it was too late. I asked a friend for a ride home, but when they dropped me off at my house, I saw my parents sleeping. The next day, my mom asked if I had come home at my curfew, and I said yes. However, this behavior continued, and I always managed to sneak in without my parents noticing.  Teenagers also sink in/out of the house. While some may argue that curfew helps teenagers to be home on time, this is not the case. Many teenagers sink out of their bedroom window, as they feel like they need to think things over or just want to go outside. For example, one night around 4 in the morning, I was asleep when I heard a lot of noise. I got up and saw my sister sink in from my bedroom window. I helped her get in my room, but we were sharing a room at the time. We both went back to bed, and we talked about it in the morning.  Lastly, most teenagers can get in trouble with their parents. When teenagers get in trouble, it is usually with their parents because most parents are strict. When parents are strict, it is because they want what is best for their children. When teenagers are in trouble, they often run to their parents for help. On a weekend, my friends and I were doing weed in one of my friend's basement, and her parents caught us. When I got home, my parents were sitting at the table, and we all talked. My parents told me to stop doing weed, and I did. However, a few years later, I started doing weed again, and somehow,		1

For example, medical professionals should be consulted when making decisions about one's health, and financial advisors should be consulted when making decisions about one's finances. However, ultimately, the final decision should be made by the individual based on their own values and priorities.		1
If we never do anything about the air pollution coming from cars will the human race last a long time? If you had to choose from killing yourself slowly or making the world healthier by walking instead of taking a car what would you choose? Many people don't understand the damage that driving all of the time is doing to our world. But, limiting car usage has many advantages that come along with it.  Limiting car usage come along with many advantages. One advantage of limiting car usage is that you can limit the amount of smog that goes into the air and also into your lungs. In source 2 it says, "After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine31." That is a very good choice of action because without hearing that they would have any consequences people still would have drove their cars. In source 2 it also says, "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..." So, by limiting car usage just by the even numbered license plates there was less smog in just one day. In source 2 it says, "The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday." So, the success of just one day made people want to do it a second day with just the oddnumbered license plates. If they keep this up and eventually have a day where neither odd nor even numbered license plates can drive the smog will eventually clear all the way up.  Also, another advantage to limiting car usage is there won't be many traffic jams. In source 3 it says, "In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams," meaning that everyone got around easily without all of the congestion in the roads. In source 3 it also says, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said the businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife." Traffic jams tend to cause alot of people stress. People stress because they can't get to important places on time, they spend hours on the same highway, etc. By limiting car usage, they limit their stress and have a good day instead of being so angry just because of traffic which will help them out in the long run because alot of stress isn't good for the body.  There are many more advantages to limiting car usage. In source 4 it says, "pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety." By just taking the little time to figure out a different, less polluting way of transportation all of these advantages come out of it.  Many people don't understand the damage that driving all of the time is doing to our world. But, limiting car usage has many advantages that come along with it. A way that I could pitch in would be to ride the school bus with everybody else instead of driving myself to school. Some advantages to that would be using less gas, saving money and carpooling so that there are less cars on the road and less air pollution, because we need the air to stay clean so we can breathe and stay alive. So by limiting car usage we can have many good things happen to our lives and to our world.		0
 A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves  In the world of cowboy lore, there are few figures as iconic as the rugged cowboy riding his horse across the vast open plains. However, there are fewer still who have had to navigate the raging waters of the ocean with their trusty mount. This cowboy's story is one of adventure, resilience, and a deep love of horses.  The cowboy's journey began on a small ranch in Texas, where he was born and raised by a family of hardworking ranchers. From a young age, he had a passion for horses and spent his days training and riding them across vast fields of grass. However, as the cowboy grew older, he found himself restless and seeking adventure. He longed to see the world beyond his small slice of Texas.  One day, as he sat by the river and watched the water flow, the cowboy was inspired to ride to the ocean. He packed his few belongings, mounted his horse, and set out on a journey that would take him across mountains, through deserts, and ultimately to the coast of California. As he rode, the cowboy encountered many challenges, from treacherous trails to dangerous beasts. However, he always kept his horse and a rifle close, and he never let fear deter him from his mission.  When the cowboy finally made it to the ocean, he was awestruck by the vast expanse of water that stretched before him. He was determined to cross the ocean and set foot on new land. However, as he stood on the shoreline and gazed out at the waves, he realized that there was one final obstacle between him and his dream.  The cowboy knew that rodeos were held on the coasts of California and Oregon, and that he needed to ride across the ocean to make it to the next competition. At first, he was hesitant to take on such a dangerous task. However, he remembered the lessons he had learned from his grandfather, who had taught him to never give up on his dreams. The cowboy knew that he had to give it a shot.  With a deep breath, he dismounted his horse and tied it to a nearby rock. The cowboy waded slowly into the waves, feeling the cool water around his ankles. At first, he was unsure of his footing, but he soon found his rhythm and began to ride the waves. It was a difficult journey, and there were many times when the cowboy felt like bailing. However, he knew that he had to keep going, as he could see the shoreline in the distance, just a few more waves away.  Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the cowboy reached the shore. He was exhausted, both physically and emotionally, but he was victorious. He had crossed the ocean on his horse, and he had made it to the land he had always dreamed of.  From that day on, the cowboy was known as the cowboy who rode the waves, and he became a legendary figure among cowboys and surf riders alike. He continued to ride his horse across the plains and through the hills, but he also found a new love for the ocean, and he would return to ride it whenever he could.  For the cowboy, the journey had always been about resilience and determination. He had faced many obstacles in his life, but he had never given up on his dreams. As he looked out at the ocean, he knew that the world was full of adventure waiting to be discovered, and he was determined to take on whatever challenges came his way.  In the end, the cowboy's story is one of strength and courage, of pushing boundaries and never giving up on your dreams. Whether you're a cowboy, a surfer, or anyone else, there is always something to be learned from this iconic figure of the American west.		1
Dear Principal,  I am against your conclusion of having students that have a grade B average only play sports or other activities. Some students probably might not take school work very seriously because their is probably no fun in school. And some other students look at this in a different way. They might think that sports are the motivation to get that grade B average.  If you let student with lower than grade B average participate in sports and other activities, then they might put in the effort to making the B average. They might actually take it seriously, because if they like playing sports and activities than they will do their best to stay on the team and do good in school. Some of the students might be slacking of because they are not in sports and are wanting to prove that they can do both.  Sports and other activities can be a way to improve the school percentage of exceptional students. That doesn't mean that none of the schools students are unexceptional, it means that this school would maybe be at, or stay, at a higher percentage.  This can also mean that the students can be the complete opposite if what this letter is saying. Students can slack off even more if sports and activities are added. Students grades would become even lower, and they might make sports their main thing st school. Activities is maybe not a big threat to some students. And maybe they are. People will try their hardest when they have the things that they need to do so. They would stay focus and on task if the have motivation.  Activities and sports is a big motivation to some people. If you want this school to stay a top school than sports and activities should not be only for certain students. And sometimes you will probably not have enough students playing sports and that means no games and no school sports and activities reputation.  Sometimes the best way for people to get better and something is to give them a motivation, or something that keeps them focused. If you want people to improve, you'll probably have to give them something that can help them do just that.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
 I strongly believe that Emerson's sentiment is accurate. It's crucial that individuals are encouraged to follow their dreams and aspirations, regardless of what others may think or say about them. We must remember that it's our responsibility to pursue our passions and work towards our goals, and we should not let the opinions of others deter us from doing so.  If you want to become a doctor, nurse, or any other profession, it's important to put in the necessary effort and dedication to achieve your goals. It may be challenging at times, but with hard work and determination, you can make your dreams a reality. It's not about what others may think or say about you; it's about what you believe in and what you're willing to do to achieve your goals.  If people don't like who you are or have negative opinions about you, it's important to not let them bring you down. Instead, use their negativity as motivation to prove to them that you don't need them in your life and that you can succeed without them. It's not about seeking validation from others, but rather focusing on your own growth and development.  At the end of the day, it's your life, and it's up to you to make the most of it. Don't let others define who you are or what you're capable of achieving. Pursue your dreams with passion and determination, and you'll be successful in whatever you choose to do.		1
Student should be able to bring their cell phone to school because if something goes wrong they can always get in touch with their parent's. some kids walk home after school and they might need to call their they parent to let them know that their okay . when they have their free time and lunch break it's best to use the phone they can be able to text and talk on their cell phone with out anyone taking their phone and telling them to put it away .  kids should turn off their cellular dives because while their in class the phone will not interrupt the teacher are the class and it will not throw them off their subject . the cell phone can start trouble because of the phone call's and text's and the teacher will keep telling them to turn it off and they never listen and by the ring tone keep playing the teacher will not be able to tech her class and then the other students will think they can call and text any time the feel free to use it in class. the phones should be turn off not on vibrate why off? because, while the child taking a test they can text another person and ask for answer and it will throw them off .  They should keep their phones always in their pockets because people can always lose their phone or get it stolen from them because they did not put it in a safer place or they laid it down some where it should not have been .		0
I strongly disagree with the principal's decision to mandate participation in at least one extracurricular activity for all students. While extracurricular activities can be beneficial, forcing students to participate in them goes against the principles of personal choice and freedom.  Firstly, students have different interests and passions, and it is unfair to force them to participate in activities that they may not enjoy. For example, a student who is not interested in sports may feel uncomfortable and out of place if they are forced to join a sports team. This can lead to feelings of anxiety, stress, and even depression, which can negatively impact their academic performance.  Secondly, students have different workloads and responsibilities outside of school. Some students may have part-time jobs or family obligations that require their attention, leaving little time for extracurricular activities. Forcing these students to participate in extracurricular activities can add unnecessary stress and pressure to their already busy lives.  Lastly, the decision to participate in extracurricular activities should be left up to the individual student and their family. Parents and guardians know their children best and can help them make informed decisions about how to spend their time outside of school. Mandating participation in extracurricular activities takes away this important decision-making process and can lead to resentment towards the school administration.  In conclusion, while extracurricular activities can be beneficial, the decision to participate in them should be left up to the individual student and their family. Forcing students to participate in activities that they may not enjoy or have time for can have negative consequences and goes against the principles of personal choice and freedom.		1
Dear State Senator, we should not keep the Electoral College. I'm in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. The electorsal college is unfair. It's outdated and irrational. Many people prefer election by popular votes. Voters should be satisfied with their vote directly towards the president. They shouldn't have to be upset if they choose candidates and those candidates choose someone else as president.  One of my reasons is because under the electorsal college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electorss, who in turn elect for the president. The electorss can be anyone not holding public office. Depending on the state, the electorss are picked by state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. The electorsal college isn't the best way to handle elections because it is the electorss who elect the president, not the people, which to me sounds unfair. Voters can't always control who their electorss will vote for and voters do get confused sometimes about the electorss. So if you really agreed on one president, chances are that might not be the president who's gonna be elected because the electorss can choose the other person running for president instead.  The electorsal college is unfair. The electorsal college consists of 538 electorss. A majority of 270 electors votes is required to elect the president. Richard Nixo, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO all agreed on abolishing the electorsal act. According to a gallop poll in 2000, over sixty percent of voter would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Voters don't want the popular vote winner to lose the presidency but because of the electorsal college it can happen. When you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electorss.  Lets say that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electorss. Those electorss can always defy the will of the people. Faithless electorss have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they pleased. Why on earth would they do such a thing. They should care about what voters believe in. In 1960, people who favored separation based on race in the Louisiana legislature nearly actually succeeded in replacing the Democratic electorss with new electorss so that they would oppose John F. Kennedy. This means the popular votes would not have actually gone to Kennedy. That is not fair. Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. They focus only on the tight races in the "swing" states.  State Senator, I'm in favor of changing to election by popular votes because it's fair. The electorsal college should stay in the past and should'nt be used anymore. The best way is for the election by popular votes. Voters should be satisfied with their vote directly towards the president. Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and decided to vote for whoever they wanted. Selfish much? People shouldn't have to be upset if they choose candidates and those candidates choose someone else as president. These electorss should consider what the people want. I believe Elections by popular votes for president of the united states is the best option.		0
Hey, so for this essay, I had to research the benefits of working in groups and I gotta say, it's pretty cool. Like, I know some people might think it's a drag to work with others, but honestly, it's actually really helpful.  First of all, when you're working in a group, you can learn from each other. Like, I'm not gonna lie, sometimes I don't know everything, and that's okay. But when I'm working with my friends, they can help me out and teach me new things. It's like, we're all learning together and it's way more fun that way. Plus, it's not just about learning new things, but also sharing our own knowledge and experiences. It's like, we're all bringing something different to the table and it makes the project way better.  Another thing I like about working in groups is that it's way more fun. Like, when I'm working alone, it can get super boring. But when I'm with my friends, we can chat and laugh and make it way more enjoyable. Plus, we can take breaks whenever we want and relax. It's like, we're not just working, we're also hanging out and having a good time. And let's be real, who doesn't love hanging out with their friends?  And lastly, working in groups can actually help us finish faster. Like, when I'm working alone, I can get stuck on something and it takes forever to figure it out. But when I'm with my friends, we can work together and figure things out way quicker. It's like, we can divide the work and tackle it together, and before we know it, the project is done. Plus, it's not just about finishing faster, but also about having a better quality work. When we work together, we can catch each other's mistakes and make sure everything is perfect.  So overall, working in groups is way better than working alone. It's like, we can learn from each other, have fun, and finish faster. And let's be real, who doesn't want to do all of those things? So, next time you're working on a project, don		1
The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  Many communities are striving to limit car usage to address growing environmental and health concerns. By reducing reliance on personal vehicles, citizens can experience numerous benefits.  One major advantage is improved air quality. As stated in Passage 1, motor vehicles contribute substantially to air pollution in cities through their emissions. Cutting back on driving would help lower levels of harmful pollutants such as particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. This would have widespread health impacts, since air pollution is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Children, the elderly, and those with existing illnesses would particularly benefit from cleaner air.   Reduced traffic also brings the advantage of less noise pollution. As noted in Passage 2, vehicle sounds carry far in urban spaces and raise ambient noise levels. The world health organization reference value for road traffic noise is much lower than what exists in many cities. By using alternatives to driving, like public transit, biking or walking, communities can lower constant traffic noise and its negative effects on well-being.  A further benefit is less traffic congestion. As cited in Passage 3, personal vehicles are inefficient users of road space compared to buses or rail systems. With fewer solo drivers clogging limited street space, mass transit and active transportation become more practical options. This eases congestion for those who still need to drive. It also leads to advantages like shorter commute times and less wasted fuel as traffic flows more smoothly.  Overall, limiting reliance on cars provides substaintial individual and societal advantages by improving environment and public health. Communities seriously committed to sustainability should encourage alternatives to personal vehicles through effective policy changes. Though adjustments may be required, citizens stand to gain in quality of life by choosing more environmentally friendly modes of transportation.		1
Boom! Generic_Name kicks the soccer ball as hard as she can towards the goal. The goaly is surprised but quick on her feet as she thrusts herself towards the ball and catches it before it reaches the net. The referee blows the whistle and that is the end of the game. Generic_Name has not only let herself down, but her team as well. Each team shake hands with each other and leave the field. You have an expression on your face that describes disappointment and anger. Our school's principal, Generic_Name then looks at you from the bleachers and calls you over. As you make your way across the field, you keep yourself questioning yourself. What did I do? Am i going to be kicked off the team? Am I not good enough? Generic_Name asks you whether or not you think everybody at school should do at least one activity or sport. Generic_Name disagrees with this statement because students have after school activities they do that include sports, private lessons, and even classes.  Sports are a great way to exercise and distract yourself from school or even things that are stressful. There are different types of sports including football, soccer, baseball, basketball, tennis, etc. Imagine yourself running across the field with a football. The game is about to end and you are tied with the other team 21-21. You are so close to making a touchdown when out of the corner of your eye, you see the other team sprinting toward you. You run faster and sprint across the field and make the touchdown. The score is now 22-21 as the whistle blows the end of the game. Your team picks you up and runs you across the field, yelling and screaming your name, "Generic_Name! Generic_Name!". Generic_Name looks your way and smiles as your still questioning. Did I change his mind? Will students be able to make their own choices of what they want?  Private lessons is another activity that most likely will be after school. There are many lessons people take and most of them are orchestra and band lessons. Orchestra lessons include the violin, viola, cello, and bass. For example, say you play the violin and you signed up for lessons. You feel the light, warm breeze on your arms as you make your way inside. You're then lead to a room where you see all the instruments of the orchestra. The instructor tells you to play a D major scale. As you spend an hour doing scales and playing music, you're time ran out and it is time to go home. You feel the slightest touch against your shoulder and as you turn around. The instructor is holding a music book for you to practice. You then take the book and make your way home.  Classes include usually art or wood making. In the wood making classes, you're given a block of wood and instructions that give you a task you must complete. In art classes, the instructor guides you through the process for your assignment and gives you the materials. After she tells you what your doing, you're then allowed to start on your own to accomplish the assignment. The art materials include paint, crayons, colored pencils, shading tools, chalk, paint brushes, etc. The wood making classes include a block of wood, sandpaper, and machines throughout the class to cut off a piece from the block. Generic_Name loves art and does painting herself with a paintbrush and a holder with different colored paints. Generic_Name also has an easel to hold her artwork, a stool to sit, and a basket with all her colored paints.  Students at school should have a choice on whether they want to do an activity or a sport. People can't¬†make decisions for others but they can make decisions for themselves. Generic_Name shouldn't have students pick school¬†activities¬†over after school activities. Students shouldn't have to choose something for school and have to give up something they enjoy after school for that certain activity or sport. Imagine yourself falling into a deep hole and have to decide over two things to get out. One choice you want but it will affect your life while the other choice wouldn't but you would not enjoy it. How would you feel? What would you choose? I disagree with this statement because many students have after school activities that may include sports, private lessons, and classes that they enjoy and are not ready to give up yet.¬†		0
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt "Do research to find enjoyable ways to spend time at a park" as an average 8th grade student:  Hey there! So, I know that sometimes it can be hard to find fun things to do on the weekends or after school, especially when you're stuck inside playing video games or watching TV. But have you ever considered spending some time at the park? Like, actually going outside and exploring nature? It's actually really fun and there are tons of cool things you can do!  First of all, you can go for a hike. Most parks have trails that you can walk or run on, and they're usually really pretty. You can see all sorts of cool plants and animals, and you might even spot a deer or a squirrel! It's like a mini-vacation from the city, and it's totally free. Plus, it's a great way to get some exercise and fresh air.  Another thing you can do at the park is have a picnic. Like, actually pack a basket with some of your favorite snacks and drinks and sit under a tree. It's a really relaxing way to spend time with your friends or family, and you can even bring a frisbee or a ball to play with. Just make sure to clean up after yourselves when you're done!  If you're feeling really adventurous, you can even try kayaking or paddleboarding. Some parks have lakes or rivers that you can rent a kayak or paddleboard and explore. It's super fun and it's a great way to see the park from a different perspective. Just make sure to wear a life jacket and follow all the safety rules!  Finally, you can also do some birdwatching. Like, seriously, parks are teeming with birds! You can bring a pair of binoculars and see how many different types of birds you can spot.

Why online classes are an innovation!  Generic_Name 3/9/20  Online classes have been an option for students since the online revolution in the early 2000's. But, some speculate that online classes are a waste of time and money, while others feel that online classes are the answer to their prayers. Many students want to learn as much as they can, but sometimes their schedules are filled to the brim with classes. Other students just cannot attend classes at all! This is where online classes come in. Online classes are beneficial to students who cannot attend regular classes; who live far from the school; and who want to take more classes than their schedule allows.  Some people have disabilities that do not allow them to go places very often. Nowadays, schools have become more friendly to disabled people. But people still feel uncomfortable when going to a school. Online school is a benefit for students who cannot attenda regular school. n Some people in wheelchairs, for example, hate going to school because thye feel uncomfortable around people who were taller than they were. The county that they lived in offered online classes, and they used those instead of going to a regular school. Most school districts offer online courses, and anyone has access to them. Even if someone just does not feel comfortable going places and interacting with others face-to-face, they have access to online schooling, and get the same education and even more classes than regular school students have.  College is always appealing, mainly towards high school seniors who will be entering the work force after high school. But colleges offer different subjects, and not all of them have the same courses. Online colleges are beneficial to students who live far from school. Many people do college searches,and can not find any colleges in their state that had the course they were looking into. They did not want to be far from home, so they looked up some colleges out of state that offered the same course they wanted to take. They found an online course at an out-of-state college, and did not have to leave home to attend college! This does not just apply to colleges, out-of- county high schools, and even middle schools offer courses not available in one direct county. Online classes make it easy to take a course that is not within a students county or state.  There are other benefits to online schooling than just distance. When a student makes their schedule for the next school year, sometimes it fills up quick, and a student may wish to take a course that they cannot take in school. Online classes are a benefit to students who do not have more room in their schedule for extra classes. Some people who are interested in space exploration and astronomy, could not an advanced astronomy class beacuse their schedules were filled with other advanced math and science classes, along with their normal core classes. But they were able to take that astronomy course online, and they love it. Onine classes make it easier to take the classes you want, and not have to make up the classes that you need in the following years. Some counties even offer classes that the rest of their state does not offer!  Taking an online class is benficial in a variety of ways. People with disabilities and who are uncomfortable in public now can go to school in the safe haven of their own homes! Students who live too far from the school that they would like tro attend can now register and take that schools online classes. Students can now also learn more advanced and uncommon subjects from home and still take their regular classes at school. People who are more comfortable at home, who want to take a class from a school far from them, and students who want to learn more can now use online classes to do just that! Now the student can use this awesome resource to their advantage!		0
I believe that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. One reason for this is that dress codes can help to create a more professional and serious atmosphere in the school. When students are dressed in a more formal manner, they are more likely to take their studies seriously and behave in a more mature manner. For example, if students are required to wear school uniforms, they will be less likely to engage in disruptive behavior, as they will feel a greater sense of responsibility to represent their school in a positive light.  Additionally, dress codes can help to reduce distractions in the classroom. When students are allowed to wear whatever they want, there may be some students who choose to wear clothing that is revealing, provocative, or offensive. This can be distracting for other students, and can also create a negative learning environment. By enforcing a dress code, schools can ensure that all students are dressed in a manner that is appropriate for a learning environment.  Finally, dress codes can help to promote a sense of unity and equality among students. When all students are required to wear the same clothing, it can help to reduce the pressure to conform to certain fashion trends or styles. This can be particularly beneficial for students who may not have the financial means to keep up with the latest fashion trends. By creating a level playing field in terms of clothing, dress codes can help to promote a more inclusive and welcoming school environment.  In conclusion, while dress codes may not be popular among all students, I believe that they are ultimately beneficial to the school environment. By creating a more professional and serious atmosphere, reducing distractions in the classroom, and promoting a sense of unity and equality, dress codes can help to create a positive learning environment for all students.		1
Driverless cars might sound awesome but at the same time they can be dangerous. I say they can be dangerous because even if the car has more nice details to it, there might still be a fail on the car. Driverless cars shouldn't exsist.  In the article it says that cars will be smarter, but the real question is will they really work well being smart? Driverless cars will be real expensive, also it will take a long time to create them. If driverless cars are to be used by everyone, it won't be good at all because not everyone can offord it, it might sound cool but it can also be dangerous. These cars won't be as smart as we want them to be. A driver will always be needed to conduct the car. The article aslo says that the laws to driving will change when these cars come to exsist. As much as we would like to not drive anymore and just let the car do all the work without our help, its not a great idea to have these cars around. We cant always trust on them, the roads won't be the sameas they are now. Driverless cars will make a huge change in driving and also, on the streets.  My overall opinion is to get these cars. Like I said at first they sound cool, but you can't always trust the car. As much as I would like to get it cause it sounds cool, I will not get as driverless car. I'd rather have an ugly looking car that i know I won't have much trouble on, than to get a smart car that I dont know if anything can go wrong. They can exsist but I say that they shouldn't make everyone get a driverless car, unless they want one.    		0
In the world we live in today, cars are used by people nearly everyday. To some they are looked at as a need such as water, food, or shelter rather something we want to improve our life. Although, it may improve our lives in the particular moment to some degree, we fail to see the greater and more longterm effects from everyday car usage. The following sources reviews these effects and reveals the problems and solutions we may have to fix them.  One of the more serious and more recognized problems from car usage is the steady increase of greenhouse gas emissions produced from vehicles all over the world. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Vauban, Germany is an example of the effort being made to reduce these greenhouse gas emissions, this experimental city is trying to remain "carfree" and in doing so the city itself has to make its own changes. This basic precept is being adopted around the world by trying to compact suburbs and make them more accessible by public transportation."When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way" said by heidrun waltersource 1. With this new experiment, people are finding ways to adapt and live the changed life while others actually feel better off.  Another serious and impacting issue from car usage is the increase in smog over big named cities. In paris, after days of a near record breaking pollution, paris bans driving throughout the city in attempt to clear up the skies. Diesel fuel is looked at as main problem paris faced in cleaning out the intensifying smog, since a france tax act favors diesel over gasoline it displays an issue the france government must correct in their own wrong doings. A different look towards car usage is that recent studies show americans buying fewer cars, getting fewer and fewer licenses, and also driving less overall. If this pattern continues there will be positive reinforcements for carbon emissions and the environment, since its the and largest emission producer in America. The internet brings a whole other chess piece to the game allowing kids to feel more connected with people without driving anywhere. "pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety." said by Bill Ford executive chairman of the Ford Motor Companysource 4.  A program set up in bogota, colombia is a program developed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. "its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." said businessman carlos arturosource 3. Sports centers and parks have also increased throughout the citybad conditioned sidewalks have been replaced with smooth onesrush hour restictions have been cut largely and high class shopping districts have also been created. This program is already looked at by many countries and is being observed by the world like an exciting experiment.  There are many advantages to limiting car use and these are just few of them. Overall, the advantages observed are just from the few examples of less car use that we have, if more people look towards this problem of over used cars.		0
Title: The Wisdom My Family Has Shared with Me  As I reflect on the wisdom my family has shared with me throughout my life, I am filled with gratitude for the lessons they have taught me. My mom, dad, and sister have each imparted valuable insights that have helped shape me into the person I am today. In this essay, I will share the wisdom they have shared with me and how it has impacted my life.  My mom has taught me the importance of kindness and compassion. She has always been there for me, offering a listening ear and a comforting hug when I needed it most. She has shown me that even in difficult times, kindness and compassion can make a difference. For example, when I was struggling in school, she encouraged me to keep trying and never give up. Her wisdom has taught me to be more empathetic and understanding towards others, and to always try to see things from their perspective.  My dad has taught me the value of hard work and perseverance.

His wisdom has taught me to be more resilient and to never give up on my goals.  My sister has taught me the power of humor and laughter. She has always been able to make me laugh, even on my worst days. She has shown me that laughter can be the best medicine and that it's important to find joy in life's simple pleasures. For example, when I was feeling down about a disappointing grade, she made me laugh by sharing a funny joke or meme. Her wisdom has taught me to not take life too seriously and to find the humor in every situation.  In conclusion, the wisdom my family has shared with me has had a profound impact on my life. My mom, dad, and sister have each taught me valuable lessons that I will carry with me throughout my life. I am grateful for their love and support, and I will always cherish		1
What is the reason why there is a face shape in Mars? No one know how it become a human face or if it a human face at all, and some think the reason behind it is that there are evidence showing live in Mars. I agree that the shape is a human face shape, but I also believe is just a landform. The reason is that as it stated in the article, the face is to attrack the people. As Technology improved, the picture are showing the real image of the face which reveal to change it shape.  The first reason to support my claim is that the face is use to attrack people, so that the people who made up the idea can earn the money. According to paragraph three it said that,"huge rock formation.. which resembles a human head... formed by shadowss giving the illusion of eyes,nose and mouth." Following the evidence is that also on paragraph three it say," The authors reasoned it would be a good way to enage the public and attract attention to Mars." This evidence tell me that with the idea of having a human face in Mars, it allowed people to think and believe what they told them.  On paragraph twelve, Garvin say that," It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."The second reason is that the face was due to a land form. The evidence not only gave me the idea of how it was form, it also give me the idea of how it reminded them of the a real life thing happen in the United State. We can already agree with this evidence that the idea of the formation for a human face was due to landforms. Also when in a different planet landform are still the same as the earth by how the land change.  There may be live in Mars, and no one know that is true. In any case the Face of Mars might looked like a real human face, but if you look closely at the face that viking take in 2001, it doesn't look like a face. In the picture it show how the landform change it, and that the reason for why there are no Face in Mars. This argument will show you why the Face of Mars is just any landform like you see in earth.                  		0
Homework is a bad thing. It's like, why do we have to do work at home when we just did work all day at school? It's like, don't teachers trust us to learn stuff on our own? I mean, come on, we're not babies no more, we can figure things out ourselves.  Plus, homework is so stressful. Like, I get home from school and I'm already tired. I don't want to have to worry about doing more work. And sometimes the homework is so hard, it's like, I don't even know what to do. And my parents are like, "You gotta do your homework," and I'm like, "But I don't understand it!" And they're like, "Well, you gotta figure it out," and it's just so frustrating.  And it's not just me. My friends hate homework too. We'll be like, "Ugh, I have so much homework tonight," and we'll all be complaining about it together. It's like, we're not alone in this.  But, some people say that homework helps us learn. And that's true, I guess. Like, if we don't practice our math problems, we might forget how to do them. But, can't we just practice them in class? Why do we have to do them at home too? And what about all the other subjects? Like, I don't see how writing an essay on the weekends is gonna help me learn. It's just busywork.  So, in conclusion, homework is pointless. It's stressful and it's not helpful. We should just do our learning in class and be done with it. That's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it.		1
Proper Driver Cellphone Usage  The question of ¬® Should Cellphones be allowed to use while driving?¬®, Is on the minds of many and it is believed that Cell phones should be used responsibly while driving to be able to stay safe and contact those you need to. Since Cellphones are storage for information to use and a fast way to contact anyone you want or need to at any time. However, Cellphones are also methods of distractions for those driving, leading to car crashes which causes injury and death.  Keeping both these in mind Cellphones should be used while driving but only to a certain degree.  Without a restriction on Cellphone usage, the results may be disastrous. A record in 2017 from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States(¬®  Cell Phones ¬®). Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent(¬® Cell Phones ¬®). There is also the fact of high school students who reported frequent texting while driving were less likely to wear a seat belt, more likely to ride with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, and more likely to drink and drive, and typing text messages reduces a driver's ability to adequately direct attention to the roadway, respond to important traffic events, and to control a vehicle within a lane and with respect to other vehicles(¬® Cell Phones ¬®).  With all these dangers present when you use your phone and drive it's hard to see why people should be allowed in any way at all. Sadly the world is not and will never be that black and white. For those using their phones, there could be a plethora of reasons including Contacting bosses and appointments to state a late arrival, contacting family and friends for important news or updates, and more. Granted, reasons may also include just wanting to converse with others and update their social media but in this day and age, more teens will be doing just that. Luckily there is a way to do all of these and still maintain a safe driving ability and that is by using Bluetooth and vocal activation/response. These features in cars and phones allow you to text back and read messages through your phone or your car just by speaking back. There is also the ability to call via Bluetooth and speak verbally while still focusing on the road and still checking in with your boss, coworkers, family, and friends.  It's no longer a matter or should or should not but a matter of how. The dangers of cellphone usage while driving is apparent in everyday life and in the shocking statistics of the matter and yet it still happens. With the technology available and proper rationale it is possible to get the best of both worlds, you can contact others for any reason and also be able to drive safely on the road. Therefore, cell phones should be allowed while driving but only to a certain degree; which is the hands' free talk and text available to you via car Bluetooth or voice recognition on your cellular devices.

People are debating whether if drivers should or should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle. Some people think that using a cell phone while operating a vehicle should be allowed because they try multi-tasking and have important calls while some are addicted and can't stay off their phone. Other people says that you shouldn't be able to be on your cell phone while operating a vehicle because the cell phone can cause accidents while driving. I also think that you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle because it can cause vehicle collisions, slow reaction time, and fatal injuries. Therefore, driving can cause many accidents that can be fatal to the driver and passengers if there is any and cell phones should only be used when not operating a vehicle.  The first reason why the use of cell phones shouldn't be allowed while operating a vehicle because there are high chances of vehicle collisions happening. Most vehicle collisions happen when the driver is texting or under the influence of alcohol. When people who drives while texting spend more time looking at their phone than the road causing poor car-following ability and lateral lane control. While under the influence of alcohol it can cause you to lose concentration and it can also hinder your ability to make rational decisions.  As stated before, these are some examples of what can cause vehicle collisions.  The second reason why you shouldn't operate a cell phone while driving because of slow reaction time.  Reaction time is the measure of how quickly an organism can respond to a particular stimulus. When your spending time at your phone and finally look up to see you're about to get into an accident it would already be too late. Reaction times with no activity were between one and two seconds. Reaction times while using a cellphone were at least three to four seconds. On top of that, drivers were more likely to miss the flashing light altogether when using a cellphone. Cellphones effects the nervous system when a person is driving.  The last reason you shouldn't drive while using a cellphone because it can cause fatal injuries that might have long-term or short-term affects. The affects can be physical, emotional, or psychological. One of the most common physical effect is whiplash. Whiplash is caused by a sudden movement of the neck. Whiplash is usually caused by rear end automobile collisions. One emotional effect can be anxiety which can cause difficulties in certain situations involving driving. The last effect is psychological which can cause PTSD. Most car accidents are the results of PTSD but can also be caused by any traumatic experience. PTSD can affect a person's ability to function normally.  People who goes through this will sometimes show a wide range of symptoms including anger, fear, shock, nervousness and feeling of mistrust or guilt.  In conclusion, people shouldn't use cellphones while operating a vehicle. IF they do it can cause life changing accidents and other serious problems in life. Also, it can hurt some people financially causing them to pay for these uneventful occurrences. Some things people can do to prevent is to turn their phone off or put it on "Do Not Disturb" mode to prevent any accidents. They can also deal with that they have to do on the phone before starting the car and driving. One more solution is that they can have the passenger relay a message for you using your phone, so you won't be distracted or tempted to pick up the phone.      		0
 An argument against the development of driverless cars has emerged in recent times due to concerns about safety, loss of jobs, and potential hacking risks. In the article   Driverless Cars are Coming,   the author discusses both aspects of the technology, highlighting its potential benefits while also acknowledging their downsides.  Introducing the topic, the author argues that the development of driverless cars would bring immense benefits such as increased safety on the roads, reduced traffic congestion, and improved accessibility to transportation. The driverless cars are designed to work faultlessly, eliminating human error, which is one of the primary reasons behind the deaths on the road. This technology will require drivers to be trained on how to use it and take frequent breaks, which will reduce fatigue, minimizing the risk of accidents. Moreover, the traffic flow will become smoother and efficient as the cars will communicate with each other, reducing the chances of human errors leading to roadblocks.  On the flip side, the author argues that driverless cars pose risks such as job losses, increased security concerns, and potential for hacking. With self-driving cars, the demand for drivers will decrease significantly, leading to thousands of job losses. This could lead to increased unemployment rates, creating socio-economic problems for many people. Moreover, the self-driving cars could have significant security risks such as hacking, as the technology relies heavily on computing systems, which could be easily targeted.  Apart from the aforementioned, the author also mentions that the self-driving cars would need frequent maintenance on the sensors and software, which would increase the production cost of vehicles. This would cause the prices of the vehicles to increase significantly, making them affordable only by a select few people.  In conclusion, the development of driverless cars will bring immense benefits such as increased safety, reduced traffic congestion, and improved accessibility to transportation. However, the risks associated with this technology cannot be ignored. The potential for job losses, increased security concerns, and potential hacking risks could pose significant challenges. Therefore, the development of this technology requires careful consideration and research to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks. Ultimately, a balanced approach to the technology's development should be taken to ensure that drivers are safe while still allowing people to access the necessary transportation.		1
My project topic is the history of the American Civil Rights movement. I plan to create a timeline presentation and corresponding paper outlining key historical events, intertwined with personal research about important figures in the movement and their legacies. I plan to conduct interviews with family and friends to gain a more personal insight into the importance of the Civil Rights Movement and to highlight the collective experiences of people on the ground. I'm looking into primary sources, including personal accounts from those who experienced the movement, as well as other sources such as books, articles, and blogs. Additionally, I plan to explore visual sources such as newspaper archives and documentaries. I will also use modern technology to look at the current landscape of the civil rights movement, especially any changes that have taken place since it occured. This will help to provide a well-rounded, comprehensive overview of the movement and its effect on people of color in the United States.		1
Did you know that one of our students got 1000 dollars cash price¬†because our principal put him in one of our school activity ! Our principal told us that we should participate in at least one of our school activity. First I did not like it. Then I thought of one kid that went to my school and got a 1000 dollars just because he was good at his activity. So I agree with this decision because students can get to know each other, students can a college degree, and it helps them learn new things.  This activity can get students and new students to know each other. They can find there new best friend in there.  New students can get out of there shy sell and can make new friends there. Even old students can make new friends there too. Probably the whole class room can become friends !  Kids can get to know each other more better if there in a school activity.  If a student is good or great at there activity. They can¬†also get a big college degree in it. Like Art or sports. there art work can go in a Art Show¬†or in sports you can go in a big show ! Maybe you can get a college degree in any activity. Also can get money and a college degree.  Students can learn new things in there school activity. Students don't know yet what and what not there good at yet. So students need to try out for these activates so they can know. Student can explore too. They still have time to try out new things and to find out what there good at. They might be good at drawing and they just don't know it yet. Probably your good at drawing too. Theses school activities can help you and your future¬†out.  Students can get to know each other more, students can get a collage degree, and students can learn new things. Students can get better in school with this and there future can be made with this too. I think this is going to be a good plan for students and kids.		0
Dear Principal:  I think students should bring their phones to class because students do like to use there cell phones after school and they might need to get up with their parents. If students use them at lunch and other free times, then you wouldn't have much texting in class. Students need their cell phones because they have to call their parents at time and the office doesn't let you use their phone all the time. When they get their phones at lunch and other free time then they would be able to do things a little better. Yes they do need to be off during class, but the teacher can check right before they start class. If they use it during lunch, then that is when some people may have to call there parents to make sure if they are riding the bus or being picked up from school. A lot of kids deal with things at home so they talk to friends by texting them so they don't get in trouble by talking. If they told them at lunch it would be kinda hard because it is always loud in there and you can never here the people talking to you. If they don't take their cell pones to school, then they wont be able to get up with the person they need to get up with. Only then they would be stuck at school and a school faculty member would have to take them home. Then their parents would be very worried about them and then they would get in big, big, big trouble. Before I got my cell phone, I would always have to use somebody else's to call my mom to come get me. That's why we do need to take our cellular phone to school with us. As I end my letter here, I would just like to say, thank you very much for reading my letter to you about cellular phone usage. I really and honestly do appreciate it very much. I am very glad that you took time out of your busy schedule to read mine and some of my classmates letters.  Thank you very much,  STUDENT_NAME		0
 Have you ever thought about the impact of going out after 10 p. m. at night? Nighttime can be a dangerous and harmful period of the day, and many people prefer to stay at home rather than going out. However, some people argue that curfews for teenagers would unfairly limit their freedom and prevent them from experiencing the world. In this essay, I will argue that the adoption of curfews for teenagers would be a beneficial idea.  Firstly, it is important to consider the safety of teenagers. While they may be less likely to be harmed during the day, they are still at risk during nighttime hours. Teenagers who go out at night may be more vulnerable to physical harm, such as assault or kidnapping. By implementing curfews, teenagers would be less likely to be out in dangerous situations, which would ultimately increase their safety.  Secondly, curfews can help teenagers stay out of trouble. While some teenagers may view curfews as a restriction on their freedom, they can also serve as a way to prevent teenagers from engaging in risky behavior. By staying at home, teenagers can avoid getting into trouble with the law or with others. Additionally, curfews can help teenagers make better choices and prioritize their time more effectively.  Finally, curfews can give teenagers more time to spend with their families. Many people believe that teenagers spend too much time with their friends and not enough time with their families. By implementing curfews, teenagers would have more time to spend with their families, which can strengthen their relationships and improve their overall well-being.  In conclusion, the adoption of curfews for teenagers would be a beneficial idea. By increasing their safety, preventing them from getting into trouble, and giving them more time to spend with their families, curfews can help teenagers make better choices and improve their overall well-being. While some people may view curfews as a restriction on their freedom, they can ultimately serve as a way to protect and guide teenagers in a positive direction.		1
To whomever it may concern,  The process of the Electoral College has been a problem for many years and deserves to be abolished at its roots. The Electoral College should not be kept due to the fact that not many Americans comprehend this legal process, swing vote catastrophies and other problems, and its lack of democratic pedigree. You may wonder why someone like me is even writing about this or why I even care, but I care about what happens in my country's economy and government, and others should too.  First thing's first: knowledge. From personal experiences and research, you may realize that the majority of Americans in 2014 couldn't describe to you what the process of the Electoral College even is. Each state is different in this process, just like each opinion is different about this topic. This is an immensely confusing subject to read about, especially when you're just an average person watching the news or reading an article online. Although, let's be real for a minute: its really difficult. The process consists of selecting the electors, and the meeting of the electors where they vote for our President and Vice President. Also, in school curriculum across the country, you never really go into depth about the Electoral College unless you're taking a hardcore government class. In this case, the students are yet to be informed about the causes and effects of the Electoral College and the disasters it can cause in our economy.  Let's continue, shall we? The swing vote catastrophies, the worrying about who will be elected and whether or not they'll do a good job controlling our government, it's just not worth it. Over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election rather than the system that we use now. When citizens vote, they're basically voting for slates of electors, who then eventually vote to elect the President as well as the Vice President. The question is: Who are the electors? Who picks them? Are they responsible with the task at hand? The fact of the matter is that you really have no control over who the electors vote for. A "faithless" elector can vote for whomever they please, even if it isn't their party's candidate. This process is extremely unfair to voters across the country, and I doubt the phrase "Life isn't fair", a quote by my grandmother, would even apply to this discussion.  As previously stated, the process of the Electoral College isn't the greatest of them all, nor is it fair to voters. I asked who the electors were, and who picks them... but where is the abundant democratic pedigree? To remind you, a democratic pedigree is the origin and history of something, especially when it is good or impressive to others. The Electoral College is outdated and irrational for our modern day concepts. This extensive process lacks alot of opinions, evidence, and background knowledge that is necessary when voting for candidates. On the other hand, there is usually a certainty of outcome in the election, and it avoids run-off elections which is pleasant to citizens who are for the Electoral College. What about the swing votes? What about the values?  To wrap things up, the Electoral College is not needed in the United States government because of lack of understanding, disasters that may be caused, and the democratic pedigree and honesty that is nowhere to be found. I hope you consider my decisions and grow very fond of my reasonings.  With great appreciation,  PROPER_NAME                                                                                                                                                           		0
Ever wonder what is a " Electoral College? Like what is that suppose to mean?, A internet campus, Tech class, or etc. Well its not actually A Electoral college is made for up coming presidents. That differrnt selections of people go and meet the president and vice presdent. The congress. The College consits up to 238 votes and only 270 on select for the presidecny.  The president electron is held evey four yeas an the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you are about to select a presdint you vote for your candidan  Two guys named Rich, Jummy carter, Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO and they are not alone according to Gallup poll in 2000, after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. The single best argument agianst the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The election would be thrown to the house or Representatives, where state delegations vote to the presdient. Because each state casts only one vote to give th voters vote to the president and another for the congress,  The House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the wall of the people, And if an electoral tie seems unlikely. A the base level the electoral colloege is unfair to voters. Because of the winner takes it all system in each state , candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chances at win at these king of states for the president. They focuse only on the the tight races in the "swing" states. There many things in the Electoral College that many people on they outside don't know what the Congress or the up running presidents are struggling it looks easy on the inside bu on the ouside wow they have a lot to work on.    		0
In the past few decades, car culture has become increasingly prevalent in the United States. This is due in part to the construction of suburbs, which are designed around the automobile. However, there are many advantages to limiting car usage.  One advantage is that limiting car usage can reduce traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can cause a great deal of stress and frustration for drivers. Limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion, and it can also make it easier for people to get around.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can improve air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and they can contribute to respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Limiting car usage can help to improve air quality, and it can make it easier for people to breathe.  Limiting car usage can also help to reduce noise pollution. Cars are a major source of noise pollution, and they can make it difficult for people to sleep, concentrate, and enjoy their surroundings. Limiting car usage can help to reduce noise pollution, and it can make it easier for people to enjoy their lives.  Limiting car usage can also help to promote physical activity. When people walk or bike instead of drive, they are getting more exercise. This can help to reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.  Limiting car usage can also help to save money. Cars are expensive to purchase, maintain, and insure. Limiting car usage can help people save money on these costs.  Overall, there are many advantages to limiting car usage.

It is good for our health, good for the environment, and good for our communities. If we want to create a better future for ourselves and for our planet, we need to start limiting our reliance on cars.		1
I dont think the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because, students should at least have the right to there own personal thoughts. Students are in a building all day with other students and teachers that they might not trust, like, or let alone even know. Students have no freedom in school, teachers make or tell students what to do everything is watched, students are constantly told what to do by adults that they dont know, let alone trust. So i think students should have the right to keep there personal thoughts, opinions, and emotional expressions as private as they want them to be. Unless you know the student is in danger that students personal thoughts, emotional expressions, and opinions should be kept as private as they wish until they are ready to talk about whatever the situation could have been. 		0
Dear Senator,  The electoral college is in fact not best form of electing the president of the United States of America. When using the electoral college for voting for president, voters are not really voting for the president. Instead, they are voting for a slate of electors who then elect the president. Voters can't always control who their electors vote for, so it is all in the hands of the chosen electors. The electors must be trusted to pick the choice that their people want, but we all know that not everyone is as trustworthy as we would like to believe. The electors could possibly vote for the party that was not wanted in the first place, which is a problem. This brings about many possible issues for the people of our country.  Having to vote for someone who then is being trusted to vote for who you would have rather voted for yourself is a huge issue. Not only could they vote for the wrong person instead of the one that you wanted, they could potentially bring the country great danger if they vote for someone who could bring about bad things to our beloved nation. The electors could always defy the will of the people.  We could save the time wasted having to vote for someone else who has the potential to vote against who we wanted to vote for by just having a direct vote for who we wanted to vote for. Having a direct vote would give the exact opinions straight from the people of the country, and there would be less arguing and hatred for who becomes the president. The whole country would be able to voice their own opinions instead of who they believe has the same opinion as them.  Having a popular vote instead of the electoral college process is a time saver, and helps the people of the country. It allows the people to vote for who they actually want directly, instead of voting for someone to then vote for the president that they want. It would give people a greater influence to vote, knowing that their own vote actually directly affects the outcome of the presidential election. It would potentially eliminate all of the electors, saving time, money, and a vote for the next president of the United States of America.    		0
There are different advantages and disadvantages from studying from home, most of the people thing that there are more disadvantages, so students won't benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Some of the reasons than affect the students are: the students won't pay the same attention studying on their home as studying in the school, it also would be easier for the students to cheat on the different activities without a teacher watching them, the network can get disconnected very easy,¬†some of the students will study at the time they want without finishing what they are suppose to finish, and they won't live the same experience with their friends in the school.  Some students have some problems paying attention in the school, most of them getting distracted doing another thing that doesn't have to be with the class, they also need a teacher that keep they remindind to do their work or stop doing the other thing, so what do you think they would when they are in home with lots of different distractions or activities to do, they won't be able to pay the same attention,¬†because they don't have the one person that tells them to be quite or be paying attention. Some times it's good to have someone that helps them remind to do what they are supposed to.  Although if the students can attend classes from home it would easier for them to¬†cheat when they are on their home, lots of students cheat on most of their tests just to get a good grade and pass the class that they need to pass, in their homes they can reach every kind of information just by searching it, so what it's going to tell us that they won't do that, instead of studying hard to get the grades they need, it is necesary to have someone to supervise how they do the exams or works that need to be made by their own. If they keep cheating, they won't learn anything from the classes they are taking.  Also it can happen that you are on a important class or some test that you are taking, and the network can just turn down. It is risky to take classes in a computer, because you don't know when the network will work in a good way, or just don't work. It can make them¬†lose some important lessons they¬†need to take or make them fail a test because of the bad network, sometimes the screen can freeze in the half of an important thing, so it is important to don't trust to much in the electronic devices we have.  Most of the students don't like to studying, don't like to do homework, or just don't like to work. So if the students would¬†be able to attend classes from home, lots of the students won't keep studying just because they don't want, they would be able to do whatever they want, because they don't have someone that helps them understanding and trying to get their work done. Most of the students don't do their work because they thing that won't be useful in their life, they need to understand that every topic in each class is important for the different things they are going to be through when they grow up.  It is also good for¬†some students to come to the school to make some friends, and do other things they won't do on their home, it is a different experience to be with lots of people, to meet them, and talk about different interestings they have, some students like to come to school just to see their friends, that what make them happy. This helps you get a social life and be happier every day.  In conclusion, there are more disadvantages than advantages from being able to attend to classes in the computer from home, all of them to keep the student studying, and keep him doing his work in the way it is supposed to be, to improve his knowledge while he is in the school.		0
Peolpe should join the program because you kinda become an explorer and see a buch of part of the world like how Luck did when he became a Seagoing Cowboys.  When he saw the Acropolis in Greece, also a toured an castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panna Canal on his way to China.  In the other hand Luke almost went flying of the boat in the dark Alantic Ocean when he was a watchman and had to check the animals every hour.  Still when he became a Seagoing  Cowboy it changed his life and maybe it can change yours to see the whole world in person.  Luke was a brave man to become a Seagoing Cowboy during World War 2.  You clould alos incourage people to become a Seagoing Cowboy and help other people.  You never know if you could change the world by becoming a  Seagoing Cowboy. May this could be a opportunity of a lifetime because it was that way for Luck and if he said no a bunch of people could be helpless.  Think about it traveling through the world see things you never saw before.  Could you change people's lifes by joinig in the Seagoing Cowboy Program.		0
Technology is the biggest thing in our world today. Technology is everywhere, its in our homes, work, and school. Using technology in the classrooms has really help students. Dr. Huang has came up with a technology that helps read people's emotions by looking at their face. Using this technology in the classroom can really help students pay attention more, help them understand, and make the students have more fun in class. This technolgy would be valuable in the classroom.  Almost every student will get bored in class atleast once in their school career, and sometimes it is hard for teachers to know if their students are getting bored and not paying attention. Most schools today have computers or laptops, by using Dr. Huang's technology the teacher can use the technology to see if their students are paying attention. If the results come back good then the teacher can move on, if not the teacher might want to go back and make the lesson more fun.  School can be hard sometimes and might be hard for students to understand what the teacher is talking about. Using the technology teachers can have their students hop on a computer or laptop and see if they are understanding the lesson. Some students learn quicker than others so this would be a good way for teacher can see where all their students are at.  This technology could make school more fun. Students do not want to listen to their teacher talk all the time. So they can use this technology to help them in school. The technology can see if the student is confused, getting bored, or understanding the topic. If the student is confused the computer can make the lesson more easier, or if they are understanding it they can make the lesson more challenging. This could help students have more fun class too because they can use technology and using technology is always fun.  Dr. Huage's technology could really help students and teachers. The students would not be as bored and understand what the teacher is teaching. This could also help the teacher on how they need to teach the lesson. This technology would be valuable in the classroom.		0
As an eighth-grade student, I believe that seeking guidance from experts and authorities on important matters is crucial for personal growth and success. While it may be tempting to rely solely on one's own intuition and opinions, the potential benefits of seeking advice from experts cannot be overstated.  One of the most significant benefits of seeking guidance from experts is that it can provide a fresh perspective on important issues. As students, we may have limited experience and knowledge in certain areas, and therefore may not be able to fully understand the complexities of a particular topic. By seeking advice from experts, we can gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter and make more informed decisions.  Additionally, seeking guidance from experts can help us to avoid making costly mistakes. For example, if we are considering a career path, seeking advice from a career counselor or mentor can help us to identify our strengths and weaknesses and make more informed decisions about which career paths are best suited to our skills and interests.  Personally, I have experienced the benefits of seeking guidance from experts firsthand. When I was deciding on a college major, I sought advice from my guidance counselor. She helped me to identify my strengths and weaknesses and provided me with a list of potential majors that were a good fit for me. As a result, I ended up majoring in biology, which I am now passionate about and excelling in.  In conclusion, seeking guidance from experts and authorities on important matters is essential for personal growth and success. By gaining a fresh perspective on important issues and avoiding costly mistakes, we can make more informed decisions and achieve our goals. As an eighth-grade student, I encourage my peers to seek advice from experts when faced with important decisions.		1
limiting car usage has an advantage because insted of using a bunch cars which most people do people can use their feet to walk and jog and legs to ride bikes insted of just sitting in chair and moving a wheel around thats why in the streets of vauban germany they completely banned people from using cars so they can be more active by using their feet to jog,run and walk and their legs to paddle a bike an other advantage that car usage has is with driving banned the air will also be extremly clean and not polluted with dirty machine gas that means people will not have to breath with dirty air and will be able to breath good and fresh this why car usage is good not only for people to be active and not lazy but to keep the air fresh and clean so that people will stay heatlhy and of course so that mother earth could be healthy as well now that people will begin to use less cars they will go to stores and buy bikes to use and people will be selling alot more bikes so for once human being have really done something good for themseleves and planet earth because earth is the only reason why human beings and other life forms exist    		0
First impressions are a crucial aspect of our lives. They are the initial thoughts and feelings that we form about someone or something when we first meet them. These impressions are often based on our past experiences, cultural background, and personal biases. Unfortunately, first impressions are almost impossible to change. In this essay, I will discuss why this is the case and provide examples to support my argument.  First impressions are important because they can greatly influence our behavior and decisions. For example, if we have a negative first impression of someone, we may be less likely to interact with them or trust them. On the other hand, if we have a positive first impression, we may be more likely to form a close relationship with them. First impressions can also impact our perception of a situation or place. For instance, if we have a negative first impression of a neighborhood, we may be less likely to move there or visit.  Despite their importance, first impressions can be difficult to change. This is because they are often based on our initial reactions to someone or something, which can be influenced by our past experiences and biases. For example, if we have had negative experiences with people from a particular cultural background, we may form a negative first impression of someone from that background, even if they are not from that culture. It can also be challenging to change the feeling associated with a first impression because it is often tied to our emotions and feelings, which can be hard to control.  Personal experiences can also make it difficult to change first impressions. For instance, if we have had a negative experience with someone from a particular profession, we may form a negative first impression of all people in that profession, even if we later meet someone who is kind and helpful. Similarly, if we have had a negative experience in a particular place, we may form a negative first impression of that place, even if we later visit and have a positive experience.  In conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change because they are important to people, and it is difficult to change the feeling associated with first impressions. Personal experiences and biases can also make it challenging to change first impressions. While first impressions can be influenced by our past experiences and biases, it is important to remember that they are not always accurate and should not be used to judge someone or something.		1
 Introduction: In the past few years, the scientific community has made significant strides in exploring Venus. Despite the planet's extreme conditions, researchers are determined to uncover its secrets and unlock the mysteries that still remain. One such researcher is Jill Tubbles, who has dedicated her life to studying the planet from afar. In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," Tubbles argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. In this essay, I will evaluate how well Tubbles supports this idea and examine the evidence from the article that supports my claim.  Body: Tubbles introduces the article by explaining the challenges that come with studying Venus, including the high temperatures, acid rain, and dense atmosphere. She acknowledges the potential dangers that come with exploring the planet, including the possibility of encountering hostile environments and even deadly organisms. However, Tubbles also argues that the potential benefits of studying Venus far outweigh the risks. She notes that Venus is similar to Earth in many ways and could provide valuable insights into the planet's habitability, as well as the formation of the solar system as a whole.  One of the main pieces of evidence Tubbles uses to support her argument is the recent discovery of evidence of liquid methane on Venus. She explains that this discovery has significant implications for the planet's potential to support life and the possibility of finding extraterrestrial organisms. Tubbles also notes that studying Venus could help us better understand the formation of planetary systems and the conditions necessary for life to develop.  Conclusion: In conclusion, Tubbles effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. She acknowledges the challenges involved and the potential risks that come with exploring the planet, but also highlights the potential benefits that could come from studying Venus. Tubbles' use of evidence, including the recent discovery of liquid methane on Venus, helps to strengthen her argument and provide a compelling case for why studying the planet is important. Overall, her essay provides a compelling case for why scientists should continue to explore Venus, despite the challenges involved.		1
  Dear State Senator,  I hope this letter finds you well. As a concerned citizen, I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. After reading the articles provided by the Office of the Federal Register and Bradford Plumer from Mother Jones, I have come to the conclusion that the Electoral College is a flawed system that needs to be reformed or abolished.  One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a more fair and representative election process. However, as Plumer points out, this argument is misguided. The winner-take-all system used in most states means that candidates focus their efforts on swing states, ignoring the needs and concerns of voters in other states. This can lead to a situation where a candidate wins the presidency with a smaller percentage of the popular vote than their opponent. For example, in the 2000 election, Al Gore received more than 540,000 more popular votes than George W. Bush but lost the presidency due to the Electoral College system. (Plumer, 2004)  Another argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it provides a check on the tyranny of the majority. However, as Posner explains, this argument is also flawed. The Electoral College system can lead to a situation where a candidate wins the presidency with a small plurality of votes in a few swing states, while receiving a much larger percentage of the popular vote nationwide. This can lead to a situation where the president is not truly representative of the will of the people. (Posner, 2012)  On the other hand, there are several reasons to abolish the Electoral College system. Firstly, it is an outdated		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I think it would be nice to be able to bring our phones to school and only use them at lunch or any other free time we have. We should be able to have the phones on in school just not aloud to have them on where you could hear it. But, having the phones in school and being able to use them whenever we have a free period is a good idea. I think this policy is better because what if someone or a family member has to tell you something very important.  I mean sometimes parents don't like to call because they know they student is in school so they'd rather text them. Instead of calling them because maybe they don't want they news broadcasted on the intercom. I don't think having the students not bring their phones to school is a good solution. Either way you put it they are going to bring their phone , or whatever else technology they have.  So I think letting the students be able to bring their phones is a good solution , because you are letting them use it at a certain time of the day maybe more because students may have a free period twice a day. Well all I'm saying is that you should take a good look into letting students bring there phone to school at least they wouldn't have they phone out only the time there aloud to use it. Like when you see teachers on there phone it's like oh ok i could use my phone to. But when they see the student use there phone it's a problem. i don't find that to be fair.  The other policy I personally believe is not a good solution , because either you put it students are going to bring there phone. You will see there phone out more than ever. And if you ask for it you wouldn't get it. They going to ignore you and act like they can't hear you with all the music they are listening to. So yeah i think it would be nice for you to look forward into having that policy you never know you might see improvement in things.  Sincerely ,  STUDENT_NAME      		0
**The Car: A Curse on Our Society**  Have you ever been stuck in traffic, burning gas and cursing your fellow drivers? If so, you're not alone. Car traffic is a major problem in our society, causing pollution, congestion, and accidents. But what if there was a way to limit car usage and make our roads more livable?  There are many advantages to limiting car usage. First, it would reduce pollution. Cars are a major source of air pollution, emitting greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we could help to clean up our air and protect our environment.  Second, limiting car usage would reduce congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, wasting time and fuel. By making it easier to get around without a car, we could reduce congestion and make our cities more livable.  Third, limiting car usage would make our roads safer. Cars are involved in a large number of accidents, and the risk of being injured or killed in a car crash is much higher than the risk of being injured or killed in other types of transportation accidents. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we could make our roads safer for everyone.  Of course, there are some challenges to limiting car usage. One challenge is that many people rely on cars for transportation. For people who live in rural areas or who have long commutes, it may not be feasible to give up their cars. Another challenge is that limiting car usage could lead to job losses in the auto industry and other industries that depend on cars.  Despite these challenges, I believe that the benefits of limiting car usage outweigh the costs. By reducing pollution, congestion, and accidents, we could make our society healthier, more livable, and safer.  **The End of Cars?**  Some people believe that the only way to truly solve the problems of car traffic is to get rid of cars altogether. While this may seem like a radical idea, it is not without merit. In fact, a number of cities around the world are already experimenting with car-free zones.  One of the most well-known car-free zones is in Copenhagen, Denmark. In 2012, the city banned cars from a large area in the city center. The ban has been a huge success, reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, and making the city more livable.  Other cities that have implemented car-free zones include London, Paris, and Milan. While these zones are not as large as the one in Copenhagen, they have also had a positive impact on traffic congestion, air quality, and livability.  The success of car-free zones shows that it is possible to create cities that are free from cars. By limiting car usage, we can make our cities healthier, more livable, and safer.  **The future of transportation is uncertain, but one thing is for sure: cars will not be the dominant mode of transportation forever. As we move towards a more sustainable future, we will need to find ways to limit car usage and make our roads more livable.**		1
Outdoor activities parks are like, super important for people to connect and form relationships, you know? Like, they're not just places to play sports or go for a run, they're also like, social hubs where people can hang out and make new friends.  First of all, the physical environment of outdoor activities parks can have a big impact on people's moods and well-being. Being in nature has been shown to reduce stress levels and improve overall mental health. When people are in a peaceful, green environment, they're more likely to feel relaxed and happy, which can help them open up and connect with others. Plus, being outside can also boost creativity and energy, which can make it easier to form new relationships.  But it's not just the physical environment that's important. Outdoor activities parks also provide a space for people to come together and engage in social activities. Like, think about it, when was the last time you had a picnic with your friends in a park? Or went on a hike with your family? These kinds of activities can help people bond and form connections that can last a lifetime.  And it's not just about the activities themselves, it's also about the people you meet while doing them. When you're in a park, you're surrounded by other people who are also there to enjoy the outdoors. This can create a sense of community and belonging, which can be really hard to find in today's world.  Plus, outdoor activities parks can also be a great way to meet new people. Like, if you're new to a city or town, going to a park can be a great way to meet other people who live there. Or, if you're just looking to expand your social circle, parks can be a great place to do that.  In conclusion, outdoor activities parks are super important for people to connect and form relationships. They provide a peaceful and social environment that can help people relax, be creative, and form new connections. So, next time you're looking to meet new people or just want to enjoy the outdoors, go to your local park and see what it has to offer!		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.  The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in the 21st century. It gives a disproportionate amount of power to a small number of states and ensures that the popular vote winner does not always become President. This is unacceptable in a democracy.  The Electoral College was created in 1787 when the United States was a very different country. At that time, there were only 13 states and the population was much smaller. The Founding Fathers believed that the Electoral College would help to protect the interests of smaller states. However, the United States has changed dramatically since then. There are now 50 states and the population has grown to over 330 million people. The Electoral College no longer serves a useful purpose and, in fact, it undermines the democratic principle of one person, one vote.  The Electoral College has been criticized for several reasons. First, it can lead to a situation where the person who wins the popular vote does not become President. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016 when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote but Donald Trump won the Electoral College vote. Second, the Electoral College gives disproportionate power to a small number of states. The 10 most populous states, which account for over 50% of the population, have only 181 electoral votes. The 20 least populous states, which account for only 12% of the population, have a total of 85 electoral votes. This means that the votes of people in small states are worth more than the votes of people in large states.  Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a small number of "swing" states. This means that they often ignore the needs of states that are considered to be "safe" for one party or the other. This is not in the best interests of the country as a whole.  There are several arguments in favor of keeping the Electoral College. One argument is that it protects the interests of small states. However, as I have explained above, the Electoral College actually gives small states disproportionate power. Another argument is that the Electoral College prevents a few large states from dominating the election. However, this is not a real concern as the 10 most populous states have only 181 electoral votes, which is a minority of the 538 electoral votes.  In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in the 21st century. I urge you to support efforts to abolish the Electoral College and elect the President of the United States by popular vote.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
The author tells us how hard and difficult it is to land or even study venus because its so hard to land on or get close to because of all the dangerous things that can happen.  venus is a very worthy planet to study because nobody has ever been on it to know if there is any kind of life ont hat planet , or if plants can grow or anything. because its the closest planet to earth but the hardest to land on.  because venus really used to be covered with oceans and etc just like earth and nobody can really tell what it looks like now theres just alot of curocity. a bunch of people wondering what it looks like.  but venus is covered with a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets. But its even more challenging with the clouds and highly corrosive sulfuric acid.  But on the surface of venus temperatures average around 800 degrees fahrenheit , and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.  venus is a hard planet to study but it is very worth it. Becayse there are alot of things you can descover about venus and alot of people that would love to know whats really on venus.         		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  My name is STUDENT_NAME, and I'm in the 8th grade (also, as you may know, I am one of your Office Aide's for 7th period). I am writing this letter to let you know how I feel about the new policy that you are trying to enforce upon us students. I personally am not in any sports this year, nor was I last year. I do not care very much about them, and many others have called me crazy for that. But, I doubt that there are very many more students that also agree with you're possible policy that "The Only Way a Student May Participate in Sports or Other Activities Unless They Maintain a B Average". I agree that that policy should be enforced upon us, because having to maintain a B average might push students harder in doing better in school; like studying more and being more focused, now that their sports are at risk. If I were in any sports, and you made that policy official, I would definitely try to study harder, be more focused, and do better in my classes that I don't do as well as others in. Thank you for taking your time to read my letter.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
 Working either individually or in groups has its advantages and disadvantages, and individuals have different opinions about which option is best for them. In this essay, we will discuss the benefits of working either individually or in groups, and why it is important to consider the option that works best for each individual.  When working individually, individuals have more control over their work and can work at their own pace. They can also focus on their own ideas and goals, without being influenced by others. Additionally, working individually can help individuals develop self-reliance and independence.  On the other hand, working in groups can provide individuals with a sense of community and collaboration. They can learn from their peers and share ideas, which can lead to more creative solutions. Working in groups can also help individuals develop communication and leadership skills.  In some cases, teachers may not prefer students working in groups because they want to see if students can complete the work independently. However, it is important to note that working in groups can also provide students with the opportunity to learn from their peers and develop their teamwork skills.  In conclusion, both working individually and in groups have their advantages and disadvantages. It is important for individuals to consider their own goals and preferences when deciding which option is best for them. Ultimately, working in groups can provide individuals with a sense of community and collaboration, while working individually can help individuals develop self-reliance and independence.		1
The Open Seas Beckon  From an early age, I have always loved adventure and exploring new places. When I first learned about the Seagoing Cowboys program, I knew it was the opportunity of a lifetime. This program allows people from all walks of life to experience the thrill of adventure on the open seas while helping an important cause.   According to the article, the Seagoing Cowboys program takes volunteers out on fishing boats to help scientists collect data about fish populations. I was eager to spend weeks at a time traveling to new ports and learning about life at sea. While fishing can be difficult work, the rewards are well worth it. Not only did I get to see whales breach just off the bow and watch dolphins leap out of the waves, but I also gained a deeper appreciation for how our actions affect the environment and local economies.  On my voyage, we visited ports all along the coast, from small fishing villages to bustling cities. In each new place, I met people with different cultures and backgrounds but the same love of the sea. Staying with host families allowed me to truly experience what life was like in these communities. I also learned valuable skills like navigating, tying knots, and operating equipment that will serve me well for years to come.   Overall, participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. I got to combine my sense of adventure with meaningfully contributing to science. The countless breathtaking sights and unforgettable people I encountered will always stay with me. For anyone longing to cast off and explore, I highly recommend applying for this program. The open seas are waiting to surprise and inspire you, just as they did for me. A life less ordinary truly begins on the water.		1
Holy Avacadoes! A new computer software has just come out, and it is designed to insure that this software can recognize our emotions, feelings, and best of all... FACIAL EXPRESSIONS! You may think this is a good idea, or maybe even a bad idea. Never the less this was not intended to be a quote "AS SEEN ON TV" commercial promoting a computer software for $19.99. It may be a good piece of technology, and a smart way to see things from another perspective. While many may argue that using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, is valuable. This may be the best idea I have ever heard of, espcially in an age where people are using facial recongnition to recognize who is coming in and out of the schools, and people can track others medical histories, and so on, and so forth. Classrooms should be more reliable when it comes down to facial recogntion, and cyberbulling.  One example on how classrooms should be using facial recognition especially with students, can be shown on paragraph #7 whenever the author mentions that home computers can't always rely on facial recongiton, but that school computers can and should. "Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. But we can write down some simple instructions that "encode" different emotions." As this paragraph is shown to readers, the author is trying to mention a point that home computers can be slow, and may not recognize faces easily, and that right there can lead to stalkers, and hacking occuring as well. Not only that but school computers can get hacked too, but with facial recogonition, they can stop that from happening.  Another example on how classrooms should use facial expressions especially with students is displayed fully in paragraph #5 when the author states that quote the "calculation" to recognize faces is so complex now that you can recognize everyone's face on a computer no matter if you mention there name. "For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look at her face." This shows us the readers that we can identify peoples faces, on either a computer, or in person. It can be very useful for counslers because they can identify who this person, or people are walking into there offices.  Finally, the last example on how classrooms should use computer facial recognition especially with students, can be traced to paragraph #9 they claim that quote "(Putting on a happy face" actually works!) this shows us the readers that whenever the computers try to recognize your face, they can also see how you were feeling, whether it was happy, sad, or even emotion. And pictures can be a good recource to identify a cas, or in the case a student.  In conclusion these examples I showed were good whenever it came down to finding out what students are in where, but it can help not only in a classroom, but aslo in the world of law enforcement, and our phones. But if you use it incorrectly, you may have serious trouble in your hands.   		0
 Venus, also known as the Earth's sister planet, is a fascinating world to explore. It is located in the same star system as Earth and shares a number of characteristics with our planet, such as a similar size and composition. However, there are also some significant differences between Venus and Earth that make it a unique destination to explore.   One of the most notable aspects of Venus is its thick atmosphere, which is composed primarily of carbon dioxide. This creates a hostile environment, with surface temperatures that can reach up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure that is nearly 100 times greater than Earth's. This makes it difficult for humans to explore the surface of Venus directly, but there are other ways to study the planet.   Satellite technology has been used to study Venus from above, allowing scientists to gather data on the planet's composition, surface features, and atmosphere. These studies have revealed some fascinating details about Venus, including the presence of mountains, trenches, and massive volcanoes. Additionally, there is evidence that Venus has a similar rotation to Earth, with the planet rotating on its axis in the opposite direction of its orbit around the sun.   While it is difficult for humans to explore Venus, there is a growing interest in sending unmanned spacecraft to the planet. These spacecraft could be designed to withstand the intense heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, allowing them to move around the planet and study its features up close.   Overall, Venus is a fascinating world to explore, with unique characteristics that make it a challenging destination to study. However, with the help of satellite technology and future unmanned spacecraft, we can continue to learn more about this intriguing planet and its relationship to Earth.		1
 The concept of car-free cities has been gaining momentum in recent years, with many cities around the world considering or even implementing policies to reduce or eliminate the use of cars in certain areas. The benefits of car-free cities are numerous, including reduced air pollution, improved public health, increased safety, and increased accessibility for people with disabilities. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of car-free cities and explore some examples of cities that have successfully implemented car-free policies.  One of the main advantages of car-free cities is that they contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment. Cars are one of the primary sources of air pollution in urban areas, and reducing the number of cars on the road can lead to a decrease in harmful emissions. By implementing bike-sharing programs and promoting public transit, cities can encourage people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles and buses, which have a much lower environmental impact.  Additionally, car-free cities tend to be safer for pedestrians and cyclists. By removing cars from certain areas, pedestrians and cyclists have more space to move around, which can reduce the risk of accidents. This can also create a more pedestrian-friendly and bike-friendly environment, which can encourage more people to walk or bike around the city, leading to a healthier and more active population.  Another advantage of car-free cities is that they provide increased accessibility for people with disabilities. By removing cars from certain areas, pedestrians and cyclists have more space to move around, which can reduce the risk of accidents. This can also create a more pedestrian-friendly and bike-friendly environment, which can encourage more people to walk or bike around the city, leading to a healthier and more active population.  One example of a city that has successfully implemented a car-free policy is Amsterdam. Amsterdam is well-known for its bike-friendly culture and has implemented a variety of policies to promote cycling in the city. For example, the city has a vast network of bike lanes and paths, as well as bike-sharing programs and bike rentals. Additionally, the city has implemented policies to reduce driving, such as low speed limits and parking fees. As a result, Amsterdam has a high cycling rate and is considered one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world.  Another example of a car-free city is Copenhagen. Like Amsterdam, Copenhagen has implemented a variety of policies to promote cycling and reduce driving. The city has a cycling infrastructure that is second to none, with a network of bike lanes and paths that extend throughout the city. Additionally, the city has implemented policies to reduce driving, such as low speed limits and parking fees. As a result, Copenhagen has one of the highest cycling rates in Europe and is considered one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world.  In conclusion, car-free cities have numerous advantages, including reduced air pollution, improved public health, increased safety, and increased accessibility for people with disabilities. The success of cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen demonstrates that these policies can be implemented effectively, and that cities can continue to work towards more sustainable and pedestrian-friendly transportation options. Ultimately, reducing the use of cars in urban areas can lead to a healthier and more sustainable society.		1
In today's society, phones are a big distraction. When someone's phone makes a sound or when someone gets a notification, that person just has to check it. Even though we all know being on the phone and driving is extremely dangerous. People should not physically use their phones while they're driving.  Using your phone and driving doesn't only put the driver in danger, but the passengers as well. A life should be way more important than a text message or notification. A person could look away for a split second and a crash could happen right in that moment. When someone is on their phone and driving they're very much capable of drifting off. Just a minor slip up could turn into a major accident.  If an accident was to occur due to someone being on their phone while driving, that person is more than likely going to be the one responsible. Distracted driving has become more normal in today's society. Most people often use their phones while driving because they feel capable of doing so. That same reason could be a cause of a death due to an accident. It would be much easier to avoid accidents if everyone started off their phones while driving.  Taking your eyes off of the road for two seconds increases your risk of crashing. People feel as if they're experienced drivers and that they know what they're doing. That's what's using their phones while driving comes into place. They might just be experienced but those around them may not be. Those around them just might crash because they were the one in their phone.  Being a distracted driver not only affects the victims but those who love them. They can prevent deaths by just putting their phones up while driving. A notification or text message can wait until the car isn't in motion. Being impatient can cause someone to lose their life because of an irresponsible driver. Phone shouldn't be used while driving.    		0
  Dear [State Senator],  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I believe it is still an essential component of our democratic system. Here are five reasons why I think the Electoral College should be kept or changed to election by popular vote:  Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. Unlike a popular vote, where a candidate could win with a plurality of votes, the Electoral College requires a candidate to receive a majority of votes, which is more democratic. In 2000, for example, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election due to the Electoral College system. Keeping the Electoral College ensures that the President is elected by a clear majority, rather than a plurality.  Secondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign across the country, rather than focusing solely on heavily populated areas. This is because the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states means that a candidate can win the presidency by carrying a few swing states, rather than winning a majority of the popular vote. As a result, candidates must appeal to voters in a wide range of states, rather than just focusing on those in their region.  Thirdly, the Electoral College ensures that every vote counts, regardless of where the voter lives. Under a popular vote system, votes in smaller states would have less weight than those in larger states. The Electoral College system, on the other hand, requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal, which means that voters in smaller states have just as much influence on the election as those in larger states.		1
 Here is a multi-paragraph essay in which I am a high school student struggling with the topic of car usage:  There are many advantages to limiting car usage. First, it helps to reduce pollution and, in doing so, it helps to reduce the impact of climate change. The less we drive our cars, the less pollution we produce.   Secondly, by reducing air and noise pollution, we can improve the quality of our lives. People who live in areas with heavy traffic and/or air pollution have higher rates of illness and mental health issues than those who do not. Limiting car usage can also help to reduce traffic accidents and fatalities and may encourage more people to bike or walk, getting exercise and improving public health.  Finally, by limiting our driving, we can save money on gas and car maintenance. This can make a huge difference in people's lives, particularly those who are struggling financially. There are many options available for getting around without a car, such as public transportation, biking, or even walking.  In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car usage. It is beneficial to the environment, helps to improve the quality of our lives, and can even save us money. I hope that by reducing our reliance on cars as a society, we can create a greener, healthier, and more sustainable future for all.		1
What are the biggest advantages of limiting car usage? Now you are probably wondering what I mean by car usage. I mean not using them so much or maybe not using them at all. You're probably thinking to your self that this is a stupid idea. You're probably right, but look at all of the up sides to it.  Think about it, if poeple stop driving motorized vehicals, there would be less smog in the air. Think about our planet, all the smog we pump out of our vehicals a day. In an artical "paris bans driving due to smog" writen by Robert Duffer, it says that Paris pumped out 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter in a week, that's a lot in one week. Also look at what smog can do, for the people with breathing problem, they'll have to wear oxygen maskes just so they can go out side. Then, a lot of plants will die not because there isn't enough carbon dioxied, the smog would be blocking out the sun light. Our planet should come first, that's why we are hear to take care of this planet.  Now think how quiet the streets would be. lets take the rurle areas for an example, there arn't any cars out their. It's nice and peaceful and you don't have worry about all the noise while your trying to take your afternoon nap. Now lets look at New York, there's nothing quiet there, theirs always cars, the noise of the cars motors running, people honking their horns and people just yell at the people in front of them because they arn't moving. I think having to deal with that every day would be annoiying.  One last thing, if people stop driving cars there would be more people walking and riding their bikes, oh and can't forget the skeatboarders. People doing that every day there would be more people in the world that would be fit. About eighty percent of America is over weight. So if we cut back on driving and start walking that percentige would go down trumendisly in a five year pirod. Also we could have more people trying out for the olympics, wouldn't that be great?  No cars sounds great to me. Now if you were going on a road trip it would be ideal to have a car for that, but in any other case you don't have use your car at all. Smog is never a great thing, it would be great to have a quiet neighborhood and there would be more fit people in the world. Over all not having cars would be great, you just don't know it yet.    		0
The seagoing cowboy's sounds like a great program.  You get to see new and diffrent things when your in it.  You also get to go on a long ship/ boat ride.  If i were a boy i'd love to do the seagoing cowboy's program.  You may not but we all have our own opinion's.  What he did was very nice, and put himself in a great spot in life.  He didn't only help himself he helped others.  Luke sounds happy and that's what most people want at least that's what i want, so if you like seeing new and bueatiful things you'll want to do this.  Luke didn't really have a choice. He had no idea that his life would change when he graduatated from high school.  He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go with him to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldn't say no, he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime.  Luke is intersting he didn't want his life to go where it was going but if you do the right and great things. The right and great things will come back to you.  And that is what happened to Luke he was doing the right thing and one or two will or did come right back.  They did have to fight for there country but it wasn't just there's it was for others also.  This was a very imformational artice about if you do the right thing it comes right back, and if you can also in this article it did.		0
Ralph Waldo Emerson was a philosopher and poet whose words still inspire countless individuals to achieve greatness. In particular, Emerson's famous quote, "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail", resonates deeply with me. In my own life, I have pushed myself to take risks and go beyond my comfort zone to achieve success. For example, during my studies, I decided to enroll in an advanced course, even though I had little prior experience in the subject. I worked hard and pushed myself beyond my expected capabilities, and eventually, I achieved success.   This experience of pushing myself to achieve success reaffirms Emerson's quote; if I had taken the easy route where the path is already laid out, I would not have had the same level of success. Furthermore, taking on new and challenging tasks has enabled me to develop unique skills and strategies to better equip myself in the future. Ultimately, I have come to realize the importance of trying and pushing oneself in order to achieve greater heights of success.		1
The picture shows a face but how long ago was that picture taken, 1976 was when the first picture was taken. In 1976 they had a camera with pixels thats not so good. The picture was taken like there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the gound or Egyptian-style pyraminds or even small shacks, you could see what they were. It was taken 43 meters away.  In 1998 the picture was taken again and the camera was getting better and better. The 1998 picture looks more clear then the pitcure that was taken in 1976. Over time the picture got more clear. 2001 the picture was taken again and it was taken 2.5 km-wide stripes away. This time it didnt even look like a face. The Middle Butte looks like a snake from in the air but doesnt make it a snake. You saying aliens made that too the way the water moved made it like that .  So facts show that at one point it looked like a face but wasnt done by alien the way the picture was taken is the reason why. You could use the moon as an example. Everyone use to think there was a man in the moon just by the way it looks but clearly there isnt a man in the moon. The way the picture taken can make a shadow and can make you see things that arent really there.		0
STUDENT_NAME  February 18, 2011  Writing  OTHER_NAME: OTHER_NAME  Dear Principal,  On average, how many sport players in this school do get high enough grades? Not very many in our school. The idea of having students with only a B or higher in their classes in not such a commendable idea. I don't think our school should have this system because students who play sports ,or do any other extra activity, find it to be a release from all the pressures of home and school. If we do allow this rule, they students will no longer find it as an escape, but another way that school try to put presser o n you to do well.  Sports and other extra actives are release from stress for students. Stress that comes from being forced to do well in school, homework, drama at home, and outside of ones home. Though I do believe if a student loves their extra curricular activity so much they will get their grades up, its not they best or most affective way. Teenage students that are involved with drugs or gangs will not play the sport any longer because they don't care about school, and find it to hard. If activities were not based on grades, less teenagers will be off the streets and start to play sports instead of getting themselves into violence and illegal situations.  Another reason why I think participate in a sport should be based on grades is a bad idea because it will put to much pressure on a student. Imagine a student with dyslexia. They love to play sport and work as hard as they can in school, but can only receive a C in their class. This will be unfair because the student works hard and does what they have to do, but they cannot play because of their dyslexia. Another example of a time this rule will not turn out so great is when a class is to hard. If everyone gets a C in that class, then non of them will be able to play their favorite sport. Students work hard and do what they have to, but sometimes their hard work is not recognized, and the only thing they pay attention to is the grade.  I believe that a better way to enforce this rule, but not to make it so hard for someone to reach the expectations is not to make it based on grades but based on their hard work and motivation in school. This will allow a student to really show what they know without feeling pressured. If a student is motivated and does the best they can when they have a lot of other drama and challenges they have to over come, I believe that it should not be based on grades.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
Goals and missions are an essential part of our lives. They provide us with direction and purpose, and help us achieve our desired outcomes. However, like any other aspect of life, setting a goal or mission comes with its benefits and drawbacks. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of setting a goal or mission in life, and how personal experiences helped determine the path I decide to take.  One of the primary benefits of setting a goal or mission in life is that it provides a clear direction. When we have a specific goal in mind, we are more likely to focus our efforts and work towards achieving it. This can lead to greater success and fulfillment in life. Additionally, setting a goal or mission can help us prioritize our time and resources, allowing us to focus on what is most important.  On the other hand, setting a goal or mission can also come with its drawbacks. One of the main drawbacks is that it can be overwhelming. When we have a clear direction in mind, it can be easy to become overwhelmed by the steps we need to take to achieve our goal. This can lead to procrastination and a lack of motivation. Additionally, setting a goal or mission can be limiting. When we focus too much on achieving a specific outcome, we may miss out on other opportunities and experiences.  Personal experiences have played a significant role in determining the path I decide to take in life. For example, when I was younger, I had a goal of becoming a professional athlete. I spent countless hours practicing and training, but ultimately, my goal was not achieved. This experience taught me the importance of perseverance and not giving up on my dreams, even when faced with obstacles.  Another personal experience that influenced my decision to take a different path in life was the influence of others. When I was younger, my parents always encouraged me to pursue my passions and follow my dreams. They taught me the importance of taking initiative and not being afraid to take risks. This influence helped me to become more confident and self-assured, and ultimately led me to pursue a career in business.  In conclusion, setting a goal or mission in life can have both benefits and drawbacks. While it provides direction and purpose, it can also be overwhelming and limiting. Personal experiences have played a significant role in determining the path I decide to take in life, and have taught me		1

Title: The Importance of Teaching Children Good Manners During Meals  As an 8th grader, I believe that teaching children good manners during meals is crucial for their social and emotional development. Proper table manners not only help children feel comfortable and confident during mealtimes but also play a significant role in shaping their social interactions and self-esteem. In this essay, I will discuss the implications of not teaching kids proper table manners, analyze how young adults who haven't been taught proper etiquette might feel during mealtimes, and investigate the benefits of instilling good manners in children.  Firstly, not teaching children good manners during meals can lead to discomfort and awkwardness during social gatherings. When children are not taught proper table manners, they may struggle to navigate different social situations, such as eating with others, sharing food, and using utensils. This can result in feelings of embarrassment and self-consciousness, which can negatively impact their social skills and self-esteem. Moreover, young adults who haven't been taught proper table manners might feel uncomfortable during mealtimes with people of their own age, leading to feelings of isolation and exclusion.  Secondly, the lack of etiquette lessons can make adults who grew up without them struggle to feel self-confident in different social settings. As children grow older, they begin to realize the importance of good manners in social interactions, and their lack of etiquette can make them feel inadequate and unprepared. This can lead to feelings of anxiety and discomfort during social gatherings, causing them to avoid social situations altogether. By teaching children good manners during meals, parents can help their children feel more confident and prepared in different social settings, which can have a positive impact on their overall well-being.  Lastly, instilling good manners in children has numerous benefits that can last a lifetime. Good table manners can help children develop self-discipline, respect, and empathy, which are essential life skills. By teaching children proper etiquette, parents can help them understand the importance of respecting others and valuing their feelings. Moreover, good manners can help children make a positive impression on others,		1
Do you believe that there were living animals on planet Mars? In this propmt I will tell you why I believe the "Face on Mars" is a natural landform.  Some people would like to belive that there were once human like creatures living on the Red Planet. Also known as Mars. They believe that the "Face on Mars" was created by aliens. As stated in paragraph 1 it says Viking 1 has spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face as it was looking for possible landing sites for VIking 2. That does't truly mean that there were aliens living there. Many people may say they have expierenced aliens. But have they really?  I believe that the "Face on Mars" is just a simple natural landform. In paragraph 8 it states that it is a very cloudy time in the month of April for the Red Planet. If no one belives that then possibly they could check again. It is very difficlut to scan a planet. More than difficlut, it is a job that will take a certain amount of time, but it is sometimes worth it. I don't believe that aliens are real. I also don't belive that Mars is a Planet that is to be liveable on. In paragraph 1 it says the "Face on Mars" was an "enormouse head that was nearly two miles for end to end."  This is why I believe that the "Face on Mars" is a natural landform. There are many other reasons why I think this, but the ones that I have stated are more likely to be understaning to one another. 		0
The author doesn't support his own idea. He lists the good of what would happen with some facts. The dangers are stacked high with exlporing Venus. With the temperture on Venus at the surface being over 800*F which in a spacesuit can still fry a person alive, and the litteral aicd rain, could malt the suit and well there goes a dead man. Even if we somehow manage to make a spacesuit that isn't going to melt or fry a person on Venus, then we can explore it. Tech these days is our down fall, we create tech thatwe use everyday, but with all the space exploration that is our go to, because we don't have the tech now to send a person from one side of the galaxy to the other. Once we do that then we can explore. Venus maybe closer to us, but there is no water present on the surface therefor no life could be living on that planet. To study Venus we would have to send someone there to collect samples, at which they have about 80% chance of death right at the moment, and a 20% chance of living. Do we want to risk someone just to explore a plant, when we haven't fully explored ours? What sence does that make? I rest my case there.		0
Hey there!   So, the influence of parents and teachers on young people, huh?  Let me tell you, they have a HUGE impact on our lives! Like, seriously huge. My parents and teachers have shaped me into the person I am today, and I'm super grateful for that.  First off, my parents. They've always been there for me, supporting me no matter what. They've taught me the importance of hard work and perseverance, and they've encouraged me to pursue my passions. For example, I've always loved playing soccer, and they've been to every single game I've played in. They've cheered me on, even when I messed up big time.  They've shown me that it's okay to make mistakes, as long as I learn from them.  And my teachers?  They're like superheroes, but instead of fighting villains, they fight for our education. They've challenged me to think critically and creatively, and they've pushed me to reach my full potential. Like, I remember last year, we were learning about fractions in math class, and it was like, super hard. But my teacher, Mrs. Johnson, took the time to explain it to me until I got it. And now, I'm actually good at fractions!   But why is it important to have goals, you ask?  Well, having goals gives us direction in life. It helps us focus on what we want to achieve, and it gives us something to work towards. And even if it seems challenging at first, having goals is like, super important for our personal growth.  Think about it, if we didn't have any goals, we'd just be floating around aimlessly, like a leaf in the wind.   Now, I have a goal for myself.

First impressions are an important part of forming relationships, but they can also be difficult to change. On the one hand, first impressions are impossible to change because they are formed in mere moments and can be hard to undo. Once someone has formed a first impression of a person, it can last an entire lifetime. For example, if someone makes a bad impression at first glance, this can be difficult to turn around and it could leave a lasting, negative impact on their reputation.   On the other hand, first impressions can be changed. It takes a lot of time and effort to right the wrongs of first impressions, but it is possible. For instance, if someone makes a bad first impression, they can take steps to demonstrate they are a kind, thoughtful, and hardworking person. Through meaningful and deep conversations, along with good actions, an individual can slowly start to change someone's perception of them and form a more positive first impression.		1
Imagine a world without any cars, people riding their bicycles and gaining more contact with the world, being able to excrises everyday, having less stress in life, and so on. There is so many advantages with limiting that amount of cars usage like being able to save money due to all the things that go along with having a car that you wouldn't have to pay anymore. There is also the fact that you will able to reduce your stress levels. The reduction of pollution from that cars will also be a advantage from limit ed usage of cars. There are so many ways to get yourself from point A to point B, why would you choose a negative one.  Money is tight in today's economy, so why won't you choose to save it and still be able to get to your destination. In Vauban, Gemany, Resident are expected to pay 40,000 dollars in order to park a car.  In Paris, you would have to pay a 22-euro, or 31 dollars fine depending what day it is inorder    		0
Dear Mr. Senator,  There are many ways to go about elections of any kind, as you may know vey well seeing that you have been in one or more yourself. This country is about the will of the people supported by their government to excel and achieve the various goals they may very well have. Voting is one of those insintives people revieve, and how it is set up is an important part of that. We should keep relying on the Electoral College to succeed in keeping our country a democracy.  Having the Electoral College is a safe way to ensure that all people in every state get to voice their opinion while still keeping in mind the majority as a priority. As stated by author Richard A. Posner, people vote for a slate of electors, not the president, whom are entrusted to vote for the presidential candidate they represent. The number of electors is determined by the population of the state, which basically means the number of members in that state's House of Representatives and two for the Senate, as stated in Source 1: What Is the Electoral College? This ultimately would provide fair numbers for the overall count without making the smaller states feel insignificant.  Even with the smaller states being fairly included people argue that candidates do not pay attention to them and disreguard their overallvotes so we should switch to popular votes. These accusations may be true in a sense but what is to be expected if they dont account for as much or maybe they are already accounted for as "decided", as stated by Richard P. Would you campaign in a place like that? Especially since having elections be decided by popular votes could result in run-off elections to which no clear winner is evident, they would result in a tie, as included by Richard A. Posner. Having a tied election would end up giving the HOR overall election power, as presented in Source 1: What Is the Electoral College, so their arguement is not considerate of all possibly outcomes.  All in all, sticking with the Electoral College seems to be the best bet for our democratic country. Electors are trustworthy, with few faults, and the system is set up in a way that is fair to all. Keeping this system just making elections easy, fair, and helps to prevent ties and future headaches for all whom are involved    		0
 The concept of a four-day workweek has been gaining popularity in recent years as a way to conserve energy and resources. While some jobs may be able to be completed during the weekdays, others may require work during the weekend days. However, it is not necessarily true that a four-day workweek would conserve much of the resources or energy even if it were implemented. This is because there are many different types of jobs that do not allow workers to work only during the weekdays. Additionally, some jobs may require work during the night or early morning hours, which would not be affected by a four-day workweek.  Furthermore, businesses may not be able to operate effectively with a four-day workweek. Many businesses have to be open during the weekends in order to accommodate customers who have time off from work. Additionally, some businesses may not be able to afford to pay their employees for a four-day workweek, which could lead to layoffs or reduced hours for workers.  In terms of schools, a four-day workweek could have both positive and negative effects on students. On the one hand, students could have more time to focus on their studies and engage in extracurricular activities. On the other hand, students may also have more time to spend on leisure activities, such as social media, video games, or watching TV, which could lead to a decrease in productivity.  Ultimately, the decision to implement a four-day workweek should be made carefully, taking into account the specific needs and circumstances of each industry and individual. While it may have some benefits in terms of energy conservation and work-life balance, it may also have unintended consequences that could negatively impact productivity and the economy.		1
A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is described by the author of the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile". This system enables computers to identify six of the human emotions. This technology should be used to read the emotional expresiions of students in a classroom, because it is a very valuable technology.  Firstly, we should have this technology because it would help explain how people would be feeling on a certain subject, lifestyle or in everyday life. "Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness." Since Dr. Eckman has programmed these emotions we can better understand how someone is feeling without having to ask him; each emotion inflicts a facial muscle movement which is recognised and is catagorized as an emotion.  In addiotion, we should have these identifiers because it could help students learn better. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This software could help someone who is easily distracted. This technology could find a way to help with this person, and the coding system could produce a lesson that this person can listen to and understand it because it was made for them.  Also, the Facial Action Coding System can help teachers and staff. Some students do not show what they are feeling. If this technology can figure out facial expressions then the teachers will know who is having a bad day, the teacher could then talk to this person privately and see how they are doing. "According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotuions, but also may even help produce them." Since studies show that if a student smiles they could have a better day. The teacher could recognise that someone is feeeling down so they could say a funny joke and sprout an emotion into a particualr student.  In the final analysis, we should have the Facial Action Coding System in school because it will help students feel better and learn better. If a student does not want to go to school then they probably do not want to learn either. If this system can make someone's day then students would want to come to school, and teachers would then have students who want to learn. "Making Mona Lisa Smile" is a great article and the technology that is included in the article may be the next big thing. The first step for the coding system is to use the technology to read the emotional expression of student in classrooms. This technology can help a student throughout their school work. It can also help the teachers to teach more passionatly to students who want to learn and are not forced to come to school, but come voluntarily.		0
It is important to be true to yourself and to be honest about who you are and what you stand for. In a world full of people who try to blend in and conform, it is important to stay true to your unique identity. Doing hard work and challenging yourself can be a way to prove who you are and to build confidence in yourself.   Personally, when I worked hard in college to achieve a difficult course, it made me realize that with the right effort and dedication, I was capable of anything. Achieving that course solidified my confidence in myself and pushed me to follow my passions. I now feel empowered to express myself freely and without judgement.   The same principle can be applied professionally. By working hard to exceed expectations I am able to show that I am trustworthy and dependable and that I take my work seriously. Doing hard work at my job has also opened up new opportunities for my career and has allowed me to advance more quickly.  No matter what the context is, I believe that demonstrating hard work and staying true to who you are can be an effective way to show yourself and the world that you are capable and resilient. Doing so can not only benefit you, but can help to inspire those around you too.		1
Hey, I'm just an average 8th grader, so bear with me on this essay! üòÖ  First impressions are like, super important, you know? Like, they can make or break how people view you. It's hard to change people's minds once they've formed an opinion of you, and that's like, really frustrating. ü§Ø  I mean, think about it. If someone meets you for the first time and you're like, really nervous or awkward, they're gonna think you're weird or unfriendly, right? It's hard to change that impression once it's been made. üòî  But, there are ways to change first impressions! Like, if you show people your fun and bubbly side, they might start to see you in a different light. Or, if you prove yourself to be really smart or talented, they might start to think you're cooler than they thought before. üòé  However, it's not always easy to change people's minds. Sometimes, they might be too set in their ways or they might not want to give you a chance. And that's like, totally unfair, right? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ ?  First impressions can also affect your reputation. If you make a bad first impression, it can be hard to shake it off and people might not take you seriously. But, if you make a good first impression, it can help you build a good reputation and people might be more likely to trust you and want to be your friend. ü§ù  So, in conclusion, first impressions are like, super important and it's hard to change them once they've been made. But, it's not impossible! If you show people your true self and prove yourself to be awesome, you might be able to change their minds and build a good reputation. üòä  I hope that makes sense! Let me know if you have any questions or if you want me to elaborate on anything. üòÉ		1
Over 85 percent of high school students do¬†extracurricular activities without being told to do so. I would disagree with the idea of forcing someone to do school activities because the student should know what is good for them by themselves, and making someone do it for you could never help. When a school chooses that you need to do something you lose the idea that when your done with school you should still do that sport or club.  There are many clubs or sports that you can do in a school but still there are less or more depending where you go but there is always quite enough activities. The chances of not going to a certain activity are high and there is not a lot you can do about it. If there is a point where there are no more places left or just to little choices that you like the school would force you to do something you dont like, giving no use to do that activity. There are many outside clubs or sports from the community that people can join and many students do. The school could never know if you were to join or not, because they dont know what happens in your life which brings me to my next point.  Time management is something many people need to build or are still working on it but no one is ever done because things keep coming into you life. The school does not always know how many test you have to study for, or how your house is being rebuilt after something broke or anything small that can still affect someones life a lot. Those reasons are just few of the things that can surprisingly¬†affect a lot of people and then too still have to put more work to do an activity is outrageous.  Making someone do something never seems to work for me my mom always told me to clean my room and I would do so but needed to make a fuss and fight about it for no reason. Now that I have grown a little older I do clean my room with no one telling because cleaning my room is no problem, but if my mom were to say I have to clean my room I would think of it as a crime against humanity, having no point and having it become a fight for no reason. The same idea can come to this argument that making something do it is worse than doing it yourself.  For a school to make a you do a activity is not fare and should not be done and doing so can harm the student in the future in many ways like time management, doing sports on your own without being told, or affecting there academics. Most students would already do a sport that they would like but not make it in because there are to many people, than this rule would force him to do a activity they would not like to do giving no point to do it anyway.		0
Dear Mr. Senator, It has come to my, as well as many other's attention, that the presidential election is something that could potentially have disastrous outcomes. You, and many politicians like yourself, have been using a system called the Electoral College that people such as Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, and Jimmy Carter have been suggesting to demolish for years now. Personally, I find it quite alarming that although this process has been with us for all of this time, we have found the flaws yet still continue to take the risks. This is not simply about picking a president anymore, this is about the freedom of America.  All in all, the Electoral College at face value seems like a good idea for choosing a winner. It seems to make sense that we would choose electorss who the president trusts that would elect him president, but when you think about it, something feels rather off. First of all, the general public places their ballots in the appropriate box believing that they are voting for their ideal candidates. In reality, however, they are voting for their electorss instead. Most people who vote are unaware of this factor, and the lack of information pertaining to it is unsettling. Not only that, but the electorss are not chosen by the people. Does this not contradict "By the people, for the people?" Where exactly do these people fit in?  Furthermore, the electorss cannot always be trusted with voting for their respective candidates. This is something referred to as the disaster factor. While most who are picked by the candidate themself are trustworthy, electorss are people who are not in office, therefore may not be as trusting. Electors are an uncertain factor and in some complex cases, even two slates for electorss can be sent which could create a hectic mess. If you are going to vote for a president who you wish to win, and your vote goes to an electors that won't come through, it takes all of the power away from the people and places it right back into the state's hands.  Another thing to consider when pondering the validity of this process is the potential of a tie with electorsal voting. In this case, the election would be in the power of the House of Representatives, and the representatives from each state would decide the winner. We have had many opportunities for a tie during the elections, one even being the difference of 5,559 in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii. The problem with this is the loss of power within the nation. Once again, the people will no longer have a say in the voting and the energy it took them to decide on a candidate and go out to vote will be for virtually nothing. The people will no longer be represented. If something like this were to happen to our country, surely people from every state would be outraged.  Now, you may be thinking to yourself, why should I be worried? Sure, it is unlikely to get a tie in the electorsal votes. However, something as huge as deciding the leader of this country should not have even a single flaw in it. Horrible and unexpected things happen everyday, why couldn't we get a tie as well? Now, the main problem with getting rid of the Electoral College is the possibility of runoff elections. In defense of this, the Electoral College is the main reason that we have runoff elections in the first place. It prevents people in certain areas from voting because they feel as if they will have no say in the final result. Even if people still voted for the fun of it, it was only because of chance or political preference. With an election by popular vote, the chances of a runoff election would be significantly lower as people would realize the power they had in deciding it.  As you finish reading this, I ask you to consider all of the points I have made. I am certain that choosing to elect by popular vote would have more benefits than sticking to the old and flawed plan, the Electoral College. Endless proof points to the conclusion that this theory is correct, as the process of picking electorss to elect the president is redundant and confusing. Finally, with all of the things that could go wrong, using a new system would be one step forward in making our nation even greater.		0
and a half hour school day would be beneficial for students and their families.  Having a school day that is one and a half hours longer could have numerous advantages for students and their families. In this essay, I will research and analyze the impact of a longer school day on academic performance, as well as explore the benefits for both students and their families. I will also compare and contrast the pros and cons of a longer school day and develop an argument as to why it would be beneficial.  Firstly, research shows that students who attend schools with longer school days tend to have better academic performance. A study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that students who attend schools with longer school days have higher test scores and are more likely to graduate from high school. This is likely due to the fact that students have more time to learn and practice new skills, as well as to complete homework assignments and study for exams.  Secondly, a longer school day could benefit students and their families in numerous ways. For example, students would have more time to participate in extracurricular activities, such as sports or music, which can help them develop important social and emotional skills. Additionally, students would have more time to spend with their families, which can improve their relationships and overall well-being.  However, there are also some potential disadvantages to a longer school day. For example, students may feel overwhelmed or stressed if they have too much homework or if they are not able to manage their time effectively. Additionally, families may struggle to find childcare or other support services if their children are in school for longer hours.  Overall, while there are both pros and cons to a longer school day, I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. By providing students with more time to learn and grow, as well as to spend time with their families, we can help them achieve their full potential and create a more supportive and inclusive learning environment.  In conclusion, a longer school day could have numerous advantages for students and their families. By providing students with more time to learn and grow, as well as to spend time with their families, we can help them achieve their full potential and create a more supportive and inclusive learning environment. While there are some potential disadvantages to a longer school day, I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks and that it would be beneficial for students and their families.		1
Hey there!  So, you know how people are always like, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" and you're like, "Uh, idk, something cool I guess?"  Well, let me tell you, choosing a career path is not exactly easy peasy. Like, have you seen the number of options out there?! It's like, what if you choose the wrong one and end up stuck in a job you hate?!   But, like, seriously, it's important to think about what you're good at and what you're interested in. I mean, who wants to be a accountant if you're not even good at math?!  And don't even get me started on the ones who are like, "I want to be a doctor!" but they're actually terrified of blood.  It's like, how are you gonna help people if you can't even handle a little bit of blood?!   So, like, I think it's important to research and explore different career paths. I mean, you could be good at something and not even know it!  Like, I'm actually pretty good at writing and stuff, so maybe I could be a writer or something.  But, like, I don't know if that's even a real career path or if I'm just, like, delusional.   And, like, education is super important too. I mean, you gotta have the right skills and knowledge to do most jobs.  Like, if you want to be a engineer, you gotta know math and science and stuff.  And if you want to be a artist, you gotta know how to use all the fancy art programs on the computer.   But, like, the thing is, some people might be like, "Oh, I know what I want to be when I grow up!" and they're like, "Okay, cool, here's a degree and good luck with that!"  And then the other person is like, "		1
 Hey Senator,  You gotta stop watching the news, man. Yeah, I get that the media is where you get your info, but believe it or not, sometimes they don't got the whole story. For example, concerning the Electoral College. Yeah, I know - it's not the most glamorous thing ever, but it's been in play since the beginning of our great nation, and I do mean great.  Truth is, the Electoral College is the only thing standing between us and a totalitarian democracy. You think I'm kidding around? Look at how closely divided the votes have been in the past ten years - it's a miracle that we've avoided a totalitarian democracy. And yeah, maybe some of the smaller states would get steamrolled by the bigger ones in a popular vote system, but that's literally the risk we have to take to strengthen our democracy, man.  But wait! There's more! The Electoral College is actually biased towards rural areas! Did you know that? The College gives more electoral votes to rural states than urban ones. That's antiprogressive, man! But the bright side is that it incentivizes politicians to pay more attention to rural areas. It's a trade-off, I know, but you didn't become a senator by avoiding tough choices, did you?  Look, I know that I'm kind of all over the place here, but I think that the Electoral College is pretty cool. It's not perfect, but if you ask me, it's a pretty good way to elect a president. If you want to become a senator who gets stuff done, you better get on board and lobby for the Electoral College. If you want to become a senator who watches the news all day and does nothing, you do you, man. Your call.   Sincerely,  Me  P.S. If you want to argue that the Electoral College is bad because it didn't go for your guy in 2016, well...that's a terrible reason to trash our electoral system.		1
 Venus, often referred to as the Earth's "sister planet," is the second planet from the sun and the closest planet to Earth. It is a terrestrial planet, much like Earth, with rocky terrain and a thin atmosphere. But what makes Venus so fascinating to explore?  Firstly, Venus is covered in thick, swirling clouds of sulfuric acid, making it one of the most inhospitable places in the solar system. These clouds create a greenhouse effect, trapping heat and making the planet's temperature extremely high. In fact, Venus is so hot that it's hotter than the surface of a boiling stove. The thick atmosphere and suffocating heat make it nearly impossible for humans to explore the planet directly.  The solution to this problem is to send robotic missions to Venus to explore its surface and atmosphere. NASA, for example, has sent several robotic missions to the planet, including the Magellan spacecraft in 1990 and the Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity rover in 2012. These missions have collected valuable data about Venus' surface and atmosphere, without putting human lives at risk.  One of the things that scientists have discovered is the presence of volcanoes, mountains, and even evidence of water on Venus. Venus has a similar day-night cycle to Earth, with daylight lasting nearly two hours. However, the planet's atmosphere is thick, with clouds that can reach up to 100 miles high. These clouds create an atmosphere that is both toxic and traps heat, making the planet inhospitable for humans.  Despite the challenges of exploring Venus, it is still a fascinating planet to study. Scientists hope that by studying Venus, they will learn more about how our own planet formed and evolved. In addition to geological features, Venus also has a unique type of volcanic eruption that is different from those on Earth.  In conclusion, Venus is a planet that presents numerous challenges to explorers. Its thick, toxic atmosphere and extreme heat make it inhospitable for humans. However, by sending robotic missions to study its surface and atmosphere, scientists can learn more about the Earth's sister planet and the formation of our planet. As technology advances, we may one day be able to set foot on Venus and explore its wonders up close.		1
I strongly disagree weth the decision that our principal made. I mean, like, why should we have to participate in extracurricular activities? It's not fair to people who don't want to do that stuff. Like, I'm just not into sports, you know? And I don't want to be forced to join a team or anything. That would be, like, super annoying.  And what about people who have, like, family obligations? My mom needs me to help her out at home after school, so I can't just go off and join a club or something. That would be, like, really rude.  I think it's important for people to have freedom to choose what they want to do. If someone wants to do sports, that's cool. But if someone doesn't, that's cool too. We should have the right to decide what we want to do with our own time.  I also think that this decision is, like, way too strict. I mean, what if someone wants to start a new club, but it's not one of the ones that the school approves of? That's not fair. We should be able to do what we want, as long as it's not harming anyone else.  I think that our principal should reconsider this decision. It's just not fair to force people to do things that they don't want to do. We should have the freedom to choose what we want to do with our own time.  So, in conclusion, I strongly disagree with the decision that our principal made. I think that we should have the freedom to choose what we want to do, and we shouldn't be forced to participate in extracurricular activities if we don't want to.		1

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is something you should definitly want to be.      		0
 Facial action encoding is a systematic coding system for interpreting the meanings behind facial expressions. It is a widely used tool in fields such as psychology and psychiatry, as well as in computer science and artificial intelligence. The system is based on the idea that different facial configurations are associated with specific emotional states or actions.  The facial action coding system is a relatively simple system, consisting of a limited number of facial configurations. These configurations are described using a combination of six basic facial expressions: smiling, frowning, squinting, raising eyebrows, lifting chin, and lowering chin. Within each expression, there are a number of specific sub-expressions that can be used to convey a particular emotion or action.  The system was first developed in the 1960s by Fritz Vlach, a German neurologist. Vlach spent many years studying facial expressions and developing a way to categorize them systematically. His system is based on three key principles: homology, invariance, and modularity.  Homology refers to the idea that different regions of the face can be mapped onto each other in a consistent way. For example, the eyes, nose, and mouth are all located in approximately the same position on the face, and the muscles that control these regions are also located in similar positions.  Invariance refers to the idea that facial expressions are inherently structured and that certain features are always present. For example, both smile and frown expressions involve the movement of the mouth, and both expressions involve the movement of a specific muscle above the eyebrows.  Modularity refers to the idea that the face can be subdivided into smaller units, each with its own set of muscle functions. This allows for more complex expressions to be created by combining different combinations of these units.  Since its development, the facial action coding system has been studied and refined by a number of researchers. It is now widely used in a range of applications, including the analysis of facial expressions in social psychology research, as well as in computer vision and robotics.  The facial action coding system has a number of advantages over other systems for interpreting facial expressions. It is relatively simple to understand and use, and it is based on a consistent set of principles that are widely accepted within the scientific community. This makes it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners working in a variety of fields.  Overall, the facial action coding system is an important tool for understanding the meanings behind facial expressions. It has a long history and has been widely studied and refined over the years. It is a simple and effective system that is widely accepted within the scientific community, and its use continues to expand into new fields and applications.		1
Sometimes in life, advice may be needed in any type of situation. Yes advice could be told by one person, but I believe it is better if a person is given advice from multiple people. I feel this way, because using different people's advice, in the same situation at the same exact time, could work better than listening to one person. Also seeing different perspectives from different people can make a person see a situation differently and how they might want to solve it.  First, Using multiple people's advice in unison can work better than just taking one person's advice. Look at different types of sports players. They learn different techniques from a line of coaches, teammates, and trainers to then use everything they've learned from all of these people at the same time. They know more than the average person and this makes them better in that sport. Take Stephen Curry for example, being one of the best guards in the league, he has had to get advice from all of his coaches, trainers etc. Now he uses everything that he has learned to become one of the best point guards in NBA history.  Secondly, seeing different perspectives or opinions from different people can make a person see a situation differently. Seeing how two people may think differently can make the person who is taking the advice see things differently and have another route to go with in their decision. In movies that have ghosts of Christmas spirits, the ghost takes the main characters to see themselves, but from a different view. This makes the main character change their ways. This is how seeing perspectives change the way people think.  In conclusion, advice from multiple people at a time helps a lot, because using different people's advice at the same time can make a person better at whatever they are doing. And also because seeing more than one perspective from multiple people can make whomever think differently about how they may want to solve their problem.   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
Dear Principal,  Community service is important for children to take part in I believe it should be a requirement for school. Helping out the community does take time away from what they need or want but in the real world you have to give time up for others. Community service is great way for kids at this school to grow. This task of helping will make them more giving and willing to help out , which is a great characteristic for a child to have. Simple tasks of service will help them be more responsible. They will have less time to finish what they need to, but it will have the children buckle down and be more efficient and responsible when it comes to time management. Community service also gets kids involved with their own community and have opportunities to help out and make the community a better place. By getting involved they are helping out the community and their self .Also it'll change the out look that many kids have about the community and they will have a better understanding of how a community functions and its problems. Community service does no harm it only helps the person participating in it . Simple services like cleaning up litter can make the community a much cleaner nice place to be in. That simple task will also teach the volunteer recycling methods and teach them how to treat things with respect. I believe community service should be a requirement it helps teach kids to be more responsible , giving, and caring. Children should have those qualities in their character and community service is a way they can explore the community and be a better person.  Sincerely ,  STUDENT_NAME		0
 Does failure play a significant role in success? This question has been pondered by many individuals throughout history, and the answer is a resounding yes. In fact, the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that "success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm." While it's true that failure can often lead to failure, I believe that Churchill's statement holds true, and that enthusiasm is the key to turning failures into successes.  First and foremost, many of the innovations and discoveries that we enjoy today are a direct result of failures. For instance, the lightbulb was invented by Thomas Edison, who failed countless times before finally discovering electricity. Edison's persistence and determination to succeed ultimately led to one of the most significant inventions in human history. Similarly, many scientists have made groundbreaking discoveries after numerous failed attempts. For example, the chickenpox vaccine was the result of countless experiments with different chemical mixtures and failed trials. It was only through perseverance and a refusal to give up that these scientists were eventually able to find a vaccine that prevents chickenpox from entering the body.  Secondly, many students have struggled in school, but with hard work and a positive attitude, they have been able to overcome their failures and succeed. For instance, I have had my own struggles in school, particularly with passing certain subjects. However, I have learned that it's important to keep trying and to never give up. I have spent more time studying with my teachers and have sought out additional resources to help me improve. As a result, I have passed all of the subjects I need to graduate, except for the one I am currently working on.  Despite my learning disability and ADHD, I have not allowed these challenges to discourage me. Instead, I have sought out extra help from my teachers and have made sure to follow the rules and attend class regularly. I have also learned to prioritize my time and to manage my attention more effectively. While many seniors may be tempted to skip class, I have chosen to stay focused on my goals and work hard to earn a high school diploma.  In conclusion, I believe that Winston Churchill's statement "success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm" holds true. While failure can be discouraging, it's important		1
I disagree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurriculars can provide benefits, mandatory participation should not be required for several reasons.  Firstly, not all students have the time or ability to commit to an after-school activity due to other obligations or circumstances outside of school. Many students have jobs or care for siblings after classes end, leaving no spare time. Some also have long commutes that prevent their involvement. Forcing these students to choose between academics and necessary responsibilities is unreasonable.   Secondly, extracurricular interests differ greatly between individuals. A mandatory policy disregards student preferences and denies them the choice to dedicate non-school hours to hobbies, relaxation, or independent studies based on their own values. Not everyone enjoys sports, arts, or student government in the same way. Forcing participation removes student autonomy over how they spend personal time outside the classroom.   Finally, a mandatory policy risks over-committing some students who may perform better focusing solely on academics. Juggling homework with additional meetings and practices could overwhelm below-average students and negatively impact their grades. A policy should consider each student's capabilities and workload limits, not treat all students uniformly.   In conclusion, while extracurricular activities provide benefits for many participants, making them compulsory denies student voices, unique circumstances, and autonomy over personal time. A flexible, optional approach allows those interested to reap rewards, while respecting others' right to choose not to participate based on individual priorities and abilities. Overall well-being, not just involvement numbers, should guide school policy decisions.		1
 Introduction:  The study of Venus has been a longstanding fascination for scientists and explorers alike. In her book "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," author Anne Lafferty proposes the idea that exploring Venus, despite the challenges it presents, is a worthy pursuit. In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.  Body:  The author's primary argument is that even though Venus poses many dangers to humans, such as extreme temperatures and toxic atmospheric conditions, it is still worth the effort to explore. The author provides several examples of past explorations to support her claim. For instance, she talks about the successful landing of the Soviet Union's Venera spacecraft on Venus in 2007. The author also discusses the ongoing attempts by NASA to send rovers to Venus, despite technical difficulties and potential risks.  Another way the author supports the idea that studying Venus is worthwhile is by highlighting its potential to provide valuable insights into the evolution of Earth. Venus is similar to Earth in many ways, such as its similar size and composition. As such, studying Venus provides clues about the early stages of Earth's atmosphere and climate. This information can be invaluable to scientists studying the effects of global warming and other environmental phenomena on Earth.  Finally, the author supports the idea that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit by emphasizing the scientific potential of the planet. The author notes that there is still much that scientists do not know about Venus, including its surface composition, climate, and geology. By studying Venus, scientists can gain new insights into the formation and evolution of planets, which can help us better understand our place in the universe.  Conclusion:  In conclusion, Anne Lafferty's argument that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is well supported by the evidence presented in her book. Whether it is the success of past explorations, the potential to provide insights into the evolution of Earth, or the scientific potential of the planet itself, Venus poses many opportunities for scientific discovery. As such, it is important that we continue to explore and study this fascinating planet, even if it means facing some dangers along the way.		1
 It's important that people stay out of trouble in order to succeed in life. This is why the city council should consider implementing a curfew law to keep teenagers out of trouble. While some teenagers may follow the law, those who do not will be breaking it. The curfew law will have many benefits, such as keeping teenagers safe and out of trouble.  For example, many teenagers stay out late socializing with their friends, and may be late to school the next morning. By implementing a curfew law, teenagers will be forced to come home earlier and be more responsible with their time. This will not only keep them safe, but also help them develop good habits that will serve them well in the future.  If the curfew law is in place, teenagers will be less likely to engage in risky behavior such as drugs, alcohol, and other dangerous activities. This will not only keep them safe, but also help them develop a strong sense of responsibility and self-discipline.  Of course, there may be some opposition to the curfew law. Some people may argue that it takes away a bit of teenagers' freedom, and that they should be allowed to make their own decisions. However, it's important to remember that freedom comes with responsibility. By implementing a curfew law, teenagers will be forced to take responsibility for their actions and make better choices.  In conclusion, implementing a curfew law to keep teenagers out of trouble is a wise decision. It will not only keep them safe, but also help them develop good habits and a strong sense of responsibility. As a society, we should prioritize the safety and well-being of our youth, and a curfew law is a step in the right direction.		1
Climate change is a pressing issue that affects us all. It's important that governments take immediate action to address it. There are several reasons why governments need to take action now.  Firstly, climate change is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and pollution. These activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to global warming and extreme weather events. It's the responsibility of governments to regulate these activities and promote sustainable practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Secondly, the effects of climate change are already being felt. Rising temperatures are melting polar ice caps, sea levels are rising, and extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense. Climate change is not just an environmental issue, it's also a human rights issue. It affects people's livelihoods, displaces communities, and increases poverty. Governments need to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change and protect their citizens.  Thirdly, delaying action on climate change will only make it more difficult and costly to address in the future. The longer we wait, the more severe the consequences will be. For example, according to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), if global warming exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius, the risk of severe droughts, floods, and storms will significantly increase. This will have disastrous consequences for communities around the world, especially those in low-lying coastal areas and small island nations.  Furthermore, taking action on climate change can have economic benefits. Investing in renewable energy sources like wind and solar power creates jobs and stimulates economic growth. In fact, according to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the renewable energy sector could support up to 46 million jobs worldwide by 2050. Additionally, transitioning to a low-carbon economy can reduce healthcare costs associated with air pollution and decrease the economic impacts of climate-related disasters.  Finally, it's important to note that climate change is a global issue that requires a global response. Governments need to work together to set targets and implement policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement, signed by almost 200 countries in 2015, is an example of international cooperation on climate change. However, more needs to be done to meet the agreement's goals of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and aiming for 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.  In conclusion, governments should take immediate action to address climate change. The reasons for this are numerous, including the responsibility to regulate human activities causing climate change, the already visible effects of climate change, the danger of delaying action, the potential economic benefits of transitioning to a low-carbon economy, and the need for international cooperation. Climate change is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention and action from governments around the world. They must take action now to protect their citizens, the environment, and the planet's future.		1
After researching the partnerships, local companies, and organizations associated with my school, I discovered many activities associated with each of them. For example, the local theater company offers volunteer opportunities, while the art museum provides educational outreach programs to the community. Additionally, each of these entities offers a unique workplace environment. The theater company has a relaxed and creative atmosphere, while the art museum has a more formal and professional environment. I must now consider which type of workplace would be the best fit for my interests and preferences.		1
  Car-free cities, such as Vauban in Germany and Paris, have implemented policies to limit car usage, leading to improved air quality and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. These efforts are part of a growing trend to prioritize sustainable transportation over car-dependent urban planning. According to a study by the New York Times, millennials are driving less than previous generations, with 23% fewer driving-age individuals on the road between 2001 and 2009. This shift towards more sustainable transportation options, such as biking, public transit, and car-sharing, has significant implications for the automotive industry.  However, some may argue that limiting car usage could negatively impact the economy and individual freedom. For instance, a report by the Federal Highway Administration states that the automotive industry is a significant contributor to the US economy, employing millions of people and generating billions of dollars in revenue. Additionally, some may view car ownership as a symbol of personal freedom and independence.  To address these concerns, it is essential to consider the long-term benefits of sustainable transportation. Limiting car usage can lead to improved public health, as air pollution from vehicle emissions is a significant health risk. According to the World Health Organization, exposure to poor air quality is responsible for over 7 million premature deaths worldwide each year. By promoting alternative transportation methods, cities can improve air quality and reduce the health risks associated with car emissions.  Furthermore, investing in sustainable transportation can stimulate local economies and create new job opportunities. A study by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy found that every dollar invested in bus rapid transit generates approximately $3 in economic returns. As cities prioritize sustainable transportation, they can create new industries		1
There is a lot controversy regarding the Electoral College system of voting in the United States. Some voting members would argue that the system, although flawed, has yet to make a monumental mistake, and say that the minor issues were resolved or at the very least barely effective in the overall outcome of the campaign. However, with the flaws and holes in the system we have already experienced, there is bound to be many more mistakes, and it would be shocking to very few that some of those mistakes are catastrophic. We should remove the system of the Electoral College because it is questionable, problematic, and does not represent well our democracy.  The electoral College uses a group of people from each state, numbers varying from each, to represent voters in an election. The voters mark down a candidate on a ballot. However, they are actually voting for a group of strangers to represent them. Many voters do not even realize that this is the case. In politics, there are many powerful and influential people who will go to drastic measures to ensure that their ideas somehow make it to power. Bribes and incentives could easily be given to electors in attempts to sway their vote. Speaking of, these electors can be anyone who are not in a public office position, emphasis on the anyone. Voters can never really be sure that they can trust those strangers who they did not even get to select. Once the votes have been counted, voters cannot fully control who the electors actually vote for. There have been instances where electors have attempted to completely avert the votes cast and choose a different candidate that they want in office. It only seems logical that voters should have a direct say in the presidential election by participating in an election by popular vote. This way, there is less opportunity for scandal and confusion in the voting process.  In 1960, a group of segretationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in removing electors who supported John F. Kennedy with those who opposed him. If this had happened, all of the states electoral votes would have been cast by biased electors, rather than by the actual voters themselves. In the same year, Hawaii sent two state electors to congress instead of one. It is sad that we maintain a system in our government that continues to let issues like this arise. Along with issues with the electors, why is it that the size of a state automatically gives it a bigger advantage in elections? Texas and California are the most two saughtafter swing states in every election. Candidates will do everything they can to win over those electoral votes. But what about the little states? Many of the smaller states do not get visited by candidates. Some never even see campaign ads. This system we are using creates target areas in the United States that are more valuable in elections than others. This is in no way fair to the voters in smaller states, despite having the exact same rights as voters of bigger states. The Electoral College is proving to be less and less glamorous with every passing election. Slip ups like this can create a monumentally bad situation, and unfortunately, this system is only bound to create more.  Many people remember the problem of the 2000 presidential election. The Electoral College had very effectively exemplified its flaws and unefficient ways of opperating. Al Gore and George Bush were running apposed, and despite winning the overall popular vote in the country, Gore lost the election to Bush. Bush had received the most electoral votes, therefore winning him the presidency. Basically, despite the fact that more citizens chose Gore to be president, Bush won out. In our constitution it is written that citizens of the United States have an unwavering right to vote and select who gets put into office. In this case, it sounds more like the number of electoral votes has an unwavering right to select who gets put into office. This goes against a democratic republic way of opperating our country and, in many ways, makes it more difficult for cititzens to take advantage of their rights.  For as many frustratingly resolvable problems that are created by the Electoral College, there are certain things about the Electoral College that could possibly make it worth keeping. For instance, there technically is no region of the country that has enough electoral votes to vote a president into office, so no one area of the controls large numbers of votes. Along with this, the system helps avoid RunOff Elections which complicate the election process and provide a clear winner. However, having a straightforward election where the votes come straight from citizens is most constitutional and much less problematic. The process has been used for a long time in our country, but it is time to make a change.  The Electoral College has proven to be more trouble than it's worth. Our country needs to decide what is within best interest for representation of our citizens, the most efficient way to opperate one of our most sacred constitutional rights, and maintain our democracy as members of our wonderful country. Remove the Electoral College system.		0
Cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives. They are used for communication, entertainment, and even education. However, the use of cell phones in classrooms has been a topic of debate among educators, parents, and students. In this essay, I will argue in favor of the use of cell phones in classrooms and provide examples to support my argument.  One of the main reasons why cell phones should be allowed in classrooms is that they can enhance student engagement. Students are more likely to be interested in a lesson if they can interact with it in a more interactive way. For example, teachers can use educational apps on cell phones to create interactive quizzes, games, and simulations that can help students to better understand the material. This can make learning more fun and engaging, which can lead to better academic performance.  Another reason why cell phones should be allowed in classrooms is that they can help students to collaborate and communicate with each other. Cell phones allow students to share information and work together on projects, even if they are not physically in the same location. For example, students can use group messaging apps to communicate with each other and collaborate on a project, even if they are in different classrooms. This can help students to develop important communication and collaboration skills that they will need in the future.  Finally, cell phones can be a valuable tool for teachers to use in the classroom. Teachers can use cell phones to access educational resources, such as lesson plans and teaching strategies, that can help them to better prepare for their lessons. They can also use cell phones to communicate with parents and students, which can help to build stronger relationships between teachers and their students.  In conclusion, cell phones can be a valuable tool for enhancing student engagement, promoting collaboration and communication, and supporting teachers in the classroom. While there may be concerns about the distractions that cell phones can cause, these can be mitigated through proper classroom management and the use of educational apps and resources. By allowing cell phones in classrooms, we can create a more engaging and collaborative learning environment that can benefit all students.		1
You may have seen venus, or sometimes called te "Evening Star", as you were stargazing, but did you know its actually a planet. Venus is also our twin in relations to density and size. It is also a planet worth exploring or pursuiting because of how much it is like Earth.  Venus is very similar to Earth in regards to size and density. This is one reasons why it's worth pursuiting. In the article it states that, "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." If Venus was like Earth long ago we can learn from it and figure out why it changed into a very hot and into unhabital conditions. Venus is also worhty of exploring because NASA has an idea on how to send humans to Venus. If they were to successfully send someone to Venus the advancement in technology would be astounding.  Exploring Venus does seem like a good idea but have you thought of the dangers of doing so. Venus' average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmosphere is almost 97% carbon dioxide. That is very dangerous conditions for a spacecraft let alone a human. In the article it says, "no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours." If a spacecraft can't even do it, can a human?  Yes it is very dangerous to explore Venus but the outcome weighs out the danger. If Venus is Earth's twin then Earth could do the samething. We need to research and explore the planet so we can see if they samething could happen to Earth. This can also give people at NASA a challenge to create something or some kind of ship that can withstand the harsh conditions. This could help with technology advancement and with the technology we may be able to go to place we've never been before.  Exploring Venus is worth it because of all the advanement that could happen. With exploring Venus can lead to so many possibilities. It can help with exploring other planets and maybe learn more about ours. It does pose a lot of risks but I feel like the outcome is greater than the risks.   		0
 In the United States, the electoral college is charged with the task of selecting the president. This system involves electors from each state casting their votes for a candidate. There has been much debate over the years about whether the electoral college works effectively and should be kept in place.  One argument in favor of the electoral college is that it represents the diversity of the country. Each state is given a number of electors based on its population, meaning that states with larger populations have more influence on the election than states with smaller populations. This ensures that the president is not just elected by densely populated cities, but also by rural areas and smaller towns.  Another argument in favor of the electoral college is that it prevents a candidate from winning the election by winning only in a few key states. Under the current system, a candidate needs to win at least 270 electoral votes to become president. This means that even if a candidate wins a large number of votes in a few states, they still need to win at least one state with a smaller number of electors to win the election. This ensures that a candidate who wins in just a few states cannot win the election with one narrow victory and lose it in the end.  However, there are also arguments against the electoral college. One is that it can marginalize the voices of voters in smaller states. Because each state has a certain number of electors, voters in smaller states have less influence on the election than voters in larger states. This means that candidates may not spend as much time and resources campaigning in smaller states, even though those states could be crucial in determining the outcome of the election.  Another argument against the electoral college is that it can lead to "winner takes all" politics. In some cases, candidates may ignore certain states altogether in order to focus on the "swing" states where they believe they have the best chance of winning. This can lead to a situation where a candidate focuses on a few key states and ignores the needs and concerns of many other voters and regions of the country.  In conclusion, the electoral college is a complex system designed to select the president of the United States. While it has its strengths, such as representing the diversity of the country and preventing a candidate from winning with one narrow victory, it also has its weaknesses, such as marginalizing the voices of voters in smaller states and leading to "winner takes all" politics. Overall, it is up to policymakers and citizens to decide whether the electoral college works effectively and should be kept in place, or whether it is time for a change.		1
The Electoral College has made everything easier on people. They keep votes fair, clear and concise and make them uncomplicated. Although there are some against the idea, the benefits outweigh the detriments immensely.  Bradford Plumer author of " " insists that "the electoral college is unfair to voters"source 2 paragraph 13. This is surely an opinion as he is just trying to deride the Electoral College. However majority of states vote in favor of the Electoral College anyway. It gives a simple vote to people and produces a clear winner. Also he states that "the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."p.12 He thinks that one representative cant speak for his region, but thats why they vote right? He represents the majority supplementing a clear representation of his stateregion.  Also columnist Richard Posner implies that the Electoral College has "a presidential candidate that has transregional appeal" Source 3 paragraph 19. So the presidential candidate can be based off a full region or more, not just a few states. This makes the vote obvious and is a more fair vote. Also the Office of Federal Register tells us there are 538 electors with a 270 majority int the Electoral CollegeSource 1 paragraph 3. Not only is there great variety present but with many votes they make the result concise.  Not only is the Electoral College making votes concise and fair, also it is currently working. Bradford Plumer states "The electoral college is...outdated"Source 2 paragraph 14. How can it be so obsolete if it is presently working out. The Electoral College is giving the vote meaning and depth in that it gives voters the choice of president and his electors. The Office of the Fedral Register informs us "You help choose you state's electors when you vote for your president"Source 1 paragraph 6. This gives the voters more voting power as the get to help choose other things in goverment.  Even though there are many counterclaims, the benefits surely outweigh the detriments. Its nearly a perfect system. The fair, multifarious choices, and clear voting of the Electoral college proves it deserves it's stay in the goverment.		0
Well in his artical "Driving Cars Are Coming" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of the driverless cars.  Lets start off by poining the good aspects out about the diverless cars. All of the driverless cars are forms of public-transport taxi systemes. They are more flexibility then a bus is.  Also let me point out that these (Driverless cars) have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. So therefore you know they are safe cars on one hand and on another hand they are not safe cars.  Let me give you some bad aspects about the driverless car. Some of those bad aspects would be that so far google cars are not truly driverless cars. They stiil need a driver to take over when pulling in or out of the driveway or dealing with trafic issues such as roadworks or accidents.  These are some positive and negative reason on way the driverless car is heplful an no-heplful. 		0
 Could a car-free city ever become a reality, and if so, what would the benefits be? In recent years, there has been a growing concern about air pollution, traffic congestion, and greenhouse gas emissions caused by cars. As a result, many cities around the world have started to explore the idea of becoming car-free, either gradually or in a single swoop. The prospect of living in a city without cars may seem impossible, but with the right policies in place, it might become a reality.  The benefits of a car-free city would be enormous. Firstly, air pollution would decrease significantly. Cars are the primary source of air pollution, and a car-free city would mean that there would be no more cars on the road to pollute the air. This would lead to cleaner air, healthier citizens, and a safer environment. Additionally, traffic congestion would be a thing of the past. Cars are the cause of almost all traffic congestion in cities, and a car-free city would mean fewer cars on the road, less congestion, and quicker travel times.  Car-free cities would also benefit the environment. Cars are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, and a car-free city would mean a substantial reduction in emissions. This would lead to a reduction in global warming, which is a major threat to the planet.  Moreover, a car-free city would promote a healthier lifestyle. People who live in car-free cities tend to be more active, as they are more likely to walk or cycle instead of driving. This would lead to a reduction in obesity, heart disease, and other health problems associated with a sedentary lifestyle. Additionally, a car-free city would be a more accessible place for people with disabilities, as they would be able to move around more easily.  A car-free city would also mean less noise pollution. Cars are a significant source of noise, and a car-free city would mean less noise, which would lead to a more peaceful environment. Additionally, a car-free city would be a place where children can play and enjoy the outdoors without the constant noise of cars surrounding them.  In conclusion, a car-free city could bring many benefits. It would allow for cleaner air, less traffic congestion, lower greenhouse gas emissions, a healthier lifestyle, accessibility for people with disabilities, and less noise pollution. While the idea of a car-free city may seem impossible, with the right policies in place, it could become a reality, and the benefits would be enormous. However, it is important to note that the gradual adoption of car-free policies might be more effective than an all-at-once approach.		1
I think the technology for the facial action coding system is a good idea beause the computer will be able to tell your emotion and see weather your happy or not. It can tell emotion from celebrity's and how they are feeling. It can also determan if someone is fake smiling or not just by the muscles in there face. the computer can tell 6 diffrent moods you might be in, happy, sad, angry, fear, disgust and surprised.  The articles says "The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles". That is telling you how the computer would be able to detect your emotions. The article also says "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal". Meaning if you are happy and act like you are sad it can still tell that your happy.  The new computer technology can even identify mixed emomtions as well. The article claims that "each expression is compared against a neutral face", meaning showing no emotion. Therefore you can tell how someone you know is feeling with the new technolgy. Its all about the muscular units in your face that tells it all.  That is why i think that the new technology called facial Action Coding System is a good idea. it is something fun to do and help figure out what people are feeling. To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.  .   		0
[Phones & Driving]  Technology and driving are a very dangerous pair they have taken so many innocent lives because people's faces are glued to their phone. In 2016 263 teen's age's (16 to 19) were killed by distracted driving. The NHTSA estimates that every day 660,000 drivers use electronic devices while behind the wheel. That's a lot of lives at stake because people are careless and can't just pull their eyes away from their phone's just to drive down the street.  In 2018 about 4,637 people died in car accidents related to distracted driving, by using cellphones. The technology of today has evolved or progressed to where there are so many new gadgets and apps that were constantly looking down at our screens. We also are always taking picture or videos while trying to drive and if you aren't recording yourself then you're probably trying to pose for the camera. Even when u don't like to drive and text or do whatever on your phone there are always going to be friends or family that encourage or want u to do something on your phone while driving. Out of all the crashes in the world 26% of those crashes are caused by texting and driving.  My reason for writing this essay is to agree that talking or being on a device while driving is dangerous. Here I will list my reasons for it being dangerous. First off it puts yourself and other drivers in harm's way and possibly hurt badly or even killed. That's you should put your phone away when driving or do whatever you have to do on it before you get on the road. Secondly you should think about the consequences before you do it such as, if I do this will it harm me and my drivers, or people in the vehicle with me. Even if you are a cellphone addict you should think about others before you drive and text.  So for the conclusion of my essay I will end it by saying this driving and text is a very bad way to hurt yourself and others on the road so if you care put down the phone, and put your eyes on the road. The world would be a safer place without people texting and driving and not paying attention to the road and their surroundings. We ask that the people that are texting and driving to please stop, because they are killing or are putting peoples children on the road in danger. I along with a bunch of other people feel distracted driving has to stop now.                     		0
  Dear [State Senator],  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I believe it is a necessary component of our democratic system.  Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that the President is elected by a broad coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones. This is particularly important in a country as diverse as the United States, where different regions have different political leanings and priorities. Without the Electoral College, a candidate could win the presidency solely by campaigning in heavily populated urban areas, ignoring the needs and concerns of rural and suburban communities.  Secondly, the Electoral College provides a mechanism for smaller states to have a voice in the presidential election. Without it, larger states would hold too much power, and smaller states would be ignored. This is particularly important for states like mine, which have a relatively small population but are still essential to the national conversation.  Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign across the country, rather than just focusing on heavily populated areas. This leads to a more informed and engaged electorate, as voters are more likely to pay attention to the campaign when they know their vote could make a difference.  Some argue that the Electoral College is unfair because it can lead to situations where the candidate who wins the popular vote does not win the presidency. However, this argument ignores the fact that the President is not elected by a popular vote, but rather by a group of electors chosen by each state. This system ensures that the President is elected by a broad coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones.  Furthermore, the idea that the Electoral College is und		1
Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some may agree that students can benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Taking classes at ones house can make them feel better about learning. Benefits of learning at home rather than having to go to a school include: concentration, comfort, and attendance to get ones education.  To be comfortable in whatever one wants to wear and seated wherever a student chooses to be in their home, can really help the student focus. Students have been aching and sore whenever it comes to sitting in the same plastic chair for hours every day to get their education. One can also take as many breaks and move around freely to do simple tasks like getting a glass of water and using the restroom. There are also not as many strict rules such as certain times someone can eat or dress according to the schools policy. Some students are introverts that dont like interacting with others and may be too shy to do thinks such as ask questions, which could result in a problem related to their education. With online programs, it can be easier to participate more and communicate with confidence.  Focusing on the lesson is the key to getting a good education. Many problems that students face in a school are distractions among peers and personal relationships with faculty and staff. In ones home, they no longer have to be concerned with who or what is going on around them rather than to concentrate on their education. students can also learn according to their own schedule. If for some reason one has to leave out of town on an emergency, they can still learn and do their work as long as they have a computer or another electronic device. It can also be less time consuming like not having to get on a vehicle, go to school, and walk between classes.  Some may say that getting on an electronic device rather than going to school to attend classes can be more tiring and stressful, because that would include staring at a screen for countless hours. Some may also complain that there isnt a person teaching the subjects, but whenever one gets tired or needs to rest, they can simply stand up, walk around, and take a break for as long as necessary. Students can also take as long as they want on whatever lesson their learning. If, for example, a student does not understand a topic, they can ask for help from a professor, or play back the lesson again until they understand what they have missed.  Staying at home rather than getting up to go to a school can be more beneficial in countless ways. Distractions are minimized at a large rate. Attendance as well, would not be a problem no matter the situation or place a student is put in. Also, being comfortable in ones own house results in the student being able to focus better. Staying at home to get an education can greatly increase the passing rate and also show better performance. Many schools should offer a program where students can attend their classes online from home.		0
First impressions are important because they are the initial thoughts and opinions that people form about someone or something. They can be based on a person's appearance, behavior, or actions. First impressions can greatly influence how people interact with others and can even determine whether or not they will have a second chance to get to know someone.  One of the main reasons why first impressions are important is because they can influence how people perceive a person's character and personality. If a person makes a good first impression, they are more likely to be perceived as trustworthy, reliable, and confident. On the other hand, if a person makes a poor first impression, they may be perceived as untrustworthy, unreliable, and even lazy.  Another reason why first impressions are important is because they can affect how people treat a person. If a person makes a good first impression, they are more likely to be treated with respect and kindness. On the other hand, if a person makes a poor first impression, they may be treated with disrespect or even hostility.  To make a good first impression on new people, there are several things that can be done. Firstly, it is important to dress appropriately for the occasion. This means dressing in a way that is appropriate for the setting and the people you will be meeting. For example, if you are attending a job interview, it is important to dress professionally in a suit and tie.  Secondly, it is important to be punctual and reliable. This means showing up on time and following through on any commitments that you have made. If you are late or unreliable, people may perceive you as untrustworthy and unprofessional.  Thirdly, it is important to be friendly and approachable. This means being open and welcoming to new people and making an effort to engage with them. It is also important to be attentive and listen to what others have to say.  Finally, it is important to be confident and self-assured. This means being comfortable in your own skin and believing in yourself. Confidence can help to project a positive image and can make you stand out from others.  In conclusion, first impressions are important because they can greatly influence how people perceive a person and can even determine whether or not they will have a second chance to get to know someone		1
working on a group project  Working in a group can have numerous advantages over working alone. Firstly, group work allows for the division of labor, which can help to get tasks done faster. When working alone, a person may become overwhelmed with the amount of work they need to complete, leading to a slower pace. However, when working in a group, each person can take on a specific task, allowing for a more efficient workflow.  Secondly, humor and laughter can provide motivation when working in groups. When people are laughing and having fun, they are more likely to feel relaxed and engaged in the task at hand. This can lead to increased productivity and a more positive work environment.  Thirdly, team-work and collaboration can improve the outcome of group work. When people work together, they can combine their strengths and skills to achieve a common goal. This can lead to more creative and innovative solutions to problems, as well as a better understanding of the task at hand.  Fourthly, working with people that you don‚Äôt usually interact with in school can provide new perspectives and ideas. When people come from different backgrounds and have different experiences, they can bring unique insights and approaches to the table. This can lead to more well-rounded and thoughtful solutions to problems.  Finally, it is important to understand a topic fully before working on a group project. When people have a clear understanding of the task at hand, they are better equipped to contribute to the group effort. This can lead to a more successful outcome, as well as a more enjoyable work experience.  In conclusion, working in a group can have numerous advantages over working alone. From increased efficiency to improved collaboration and motivation, group work can lead to a more successful and enjoyable work experience. However, it is important to understand a topic fully before working on a group project and to work with people that bring unique perspectives and ideas to the table. By doing so, groups can achieve their goals and improve their outcomes.		1
  Dear [State Senator's Name],  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system and its significance in the presidential election process. As you may know, there has been ongoing debate on whether the Electoral College should be abolished and replaced by a popular vote system. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I believe it is still a crucial component of our democratic system.  One of the primary arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a more accurate reflection of the popular vote. As Bradford Plumer from Mother Jones notes, "the Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states." (Source 2) By awarding electoral votes based on the popular vote within each state, the Electoral College ensures that the president is elected by a broad coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones. This system encourages candidates to campaign extensively in all states, rather than just focusing on the most populous ones.  Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it prevents a candidate from winning the presidency without receiving broad national support. As Judge Richard A. Posner from Slate Magazine explains, "a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible‚Äîit happened in 2000‚Äîbut it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote." (Source 3) The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, as no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This induces candidates to focus on the toss-up states, which are more likely		1
"So Mr. Ashwalt now that you've read the article what do you think."Mr. Ashwalt answering, "Well i think it pretty self explaitory it talks about Mars and that how he face on it from 1976 it has changed gradually in 2001." "Ah yes the atritcle also says that it had been twenty five years of change" I exlcaimed. Mr. Ashwalt questioned " Yes but i want to question how the rock formation happened to make a face in the ground." I anwsered "Oh yes good question it says here that it must have been degree of surprise among mission controllers on paragraph two of the article.  " Mr. Ashwalt asked "Yes and how come it has grabed the attention of many people about Mars having a face on it?" I anwsered "Another good question that i don't know the anwser to but my guess would be that, people have a interest on what happenes on something new." "Also Mr. Ashwalt what did you think when you first saw the picture?" Mr. Ashwalt anwsered "Oh I thought that it was partially real but it could have been fake but i kept reading and saw that it looked like a face because of the ilussions of the shadows by the sunlight reflecting." "Yes your right Mr. Ashwalt and where did you find that in the article?" MrAshwalt anwsered " I found it on paragraph three of the article."  "Good to know."  "I think I have a question for you." I answered " Yes sir? "Would you think that aliens have made this when you first saw it?" I anwsered "Not really because in the article on paragraph three that it was an illusion made by shadows." I questioned also would you think that. that's why it attracted so many people because people maybe thought it was created by aliens?" Mr. Ashwalt anwsered "I supose so but it's what other people think not me."         		0
I am againt the development of driverless cars. Driverless cars need a whole lot of sensors. Radar was a device on a hiltop that cost two hundred million dollars. We should be investing that money on things that are important. For example help people in need, feed the hungry ect. Why woukld anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't the drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive? we are becoming lazier by the time. Imagaine how much money the driverless cars will cost in the future. Most of of wouldn't even have the money to afford them. We will still buy them, why? Because everyone will have them and it will be the trend, we get carried away for what others get or do and we want to do the same. If technology failed and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacture? We shouldn't trust in techonolgy, failure could happen. hese werer some reasons why I am againt the development of driverless cars.   		0
When looking at the Facial Action Coding System and seeing what it did for this peinting, I think it would be a great idea to use in the classrooms to reqd the students emotional expressions. Dr. Haung observes that many artists likr da Vinci did, and he relized that tney studied human anatomy, this is how they were abel to paint facilmuscles precisely. Dr. Haung relized that by haveing a machine like this one, doctors would be abel to performe better surgery by useing video surgery and or better graphics for video games, beter quality images of human faces and better muscel pictures would become a huge hit in the medical field.  Dr. Eckman and Dr. Haung were both abel to figure out that if you raise your lips at the corner of your mouth, squint your eyes slightly, and raise the outer parts of your cheeks toward your eyes, your lab partner would be clueless on what emotion you were performing. These are the instructions on how to look happy says Dr. Haung. The Facial Action Coding System can even detect when you are forcing a fake smile instead of a real simle.  This is why I feel that putting the Facial Action Coding System into schools acros the globe would be a good thing. Not only would this give the schools feed back on how their students mental state changes throughout the day, but also this machine would help detect early signs of depression and posibly signs of bullying. When students tell teachers they are not getting bullied or hurassed, the Facial Action System might be abel to detect when a student is lying an d or not wanting to share all of the details in his or her life.  These are all the reasons I personally think the Facial Action Coding System should be placed in schools everywhere. People were interested in the face and how the mucels work even whe da Vinci was alive all the way to today when we are atill intdrested in how the fave and muscels not only work, but how they can be minipulated and how each emotion brings on different muscels.   		0
I am sure if a school has a options like this, many students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because the students they going to make extra work after school at home in online or video conferencing. That is mean the students spend more time in do it extra classes in online and also they can abvance more in some classes. Thus helping to them for graduation more fast from school. After they can started more fast the college and finish youngers high school and college.  For example a builder if he has a job with benefit is more probable his state and make extra hours in the job and finish more fast. Also when a builder have more benefit like good machinery or more people working together, he can abvance more fast in the construction. The builder is going to construct more fast with the machenery and spend less time in a work. Thus overtake more and he is going to finish more fast the labor in his job. After the builder he would started a new work.  For example my cousin the last year he was soo frustrate with some classes. But after he went to the office and there the counselor tell him, that he has to take the class in online if he wanted graduation next year. The conselor offer to my cousin a capple classes in online, the class my cousin need and that moment. After my cousin he said "thanks to god this school have this benefit ". Now my cousin is going to graduation this year he has only to pass 3 classes more and after he graduation.  However some people they has this kind oportunity and benefit but they don't take. Although some people really want the benefit and oportunity and they really want overcome they don't think to much and they take this benefit in anyplace at school,in a job, even in a sport. At the school the students take this benefit in online or video conferencing they abvance in class they not waste time and they graduation early. In construction the builder he has a good benefit with the machenery and working in a group of people his abvance in any working and also win more money. My cousin he pass 3 classes in only now he is closet to graduation, the option of to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a good benefit for every students in the school.		0
Introduction: Hey there! I'm super excited to share my thoughts on the Face on Mars with you. I know some people think it's this crazy alien structure, but let me tell you, it's actually just a natural landform! Yeah, I know, it sounds a little weird, but hear me out.  Body: First off, let's talk about how the Face was formed. According to the article, it's actually just a bunch of hills and valleys that, when viewed from a certain angle, look like a face. It's called "pareidolia," where our brains see patterns and shapes in random stuff. Like when you look at a cloud and see a rabbit or something. It's not actually a rabbit, it just looks like one!  But here's the cool part: the article says that the Face is actually a result of erosion! Yep, just like how rivers and wind can carve out rocks and stuff on Earth, the wind and ice on Mars did the same thing. It's like a natural sculpture! And the reason it looks so similar to a face is because, well, our brains are wired to recognize faces. It's like our brains are trying to make sense of this random stuff and they're like, "Hey, that looks like a face!"  And don't even get me started on the "alien" stuff. I mean, come on, if aliens were gonna build a face on Mars, wouldn't they make it, like, way bigger? And wouldn't they want to make it look, you know, more alien-y? Like, with some weird tentacles or something? But no, the Face is just a bunch of hills and valleys that look like a face because of how the light hits it.  Evidence from the article that supports my claims:  * "Pareidolia is a psychological phenomenon in which the mind perceives a familiar pattern or image where none exists." (para. 2) * "The 'Face' is a result of erosion, created by the wind and ice that have ravaged the Martian surface over millions of years." (para. 5) * "The Face is not a single structure, but rather a collection of hills and valleys that, when viewed from a certain angle, form a face-like feature." (para. 7)  Conclusion: So there you have it, folks! The Face on Mars is not some crazy alien structure, it's just a natural landform that our brains are interpreting as a face because of pareidolia. It's like a fun optical illusion, but on a much bigger scale! And honestly, I think it's way cooler that it's a natural part of Mars than if it were some alien thing. I mean, come on, we're talking about a planet here, not some little green men! üòú  I hope this essay helped convince you that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform and not some alien structure. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with! üòä		1
Limiting the usage of cars will bring a lot of advantages for everyone. Cars are creating massive amounts of smog, which is not good for our planet Earth. It has also been said by many people that they feel better without cars. People now a days are even losing interest in cars. Although cars do get us to places faster and they are very useful, there are more advantages for us as human beings and for our planet Earth. Without our planet Earth, we won't have anywhere to live in so let's get rid of cars.  According to source two, "Congestion went down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...". This all happened because paris banned driving and everyone was ordered to leave their cars at home or would have to pay a 22euro fine, better understood as 31 in the United States. The air of the city had "147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London" source 2. By banning driving for five days, the air in this city was cleared out tremendously. This is good for us because we need clean air to breath, we can't breath air that is not healthy for us. If we do, we're all going to die sooner or later and it's all going to be our fault.  It is also an advantage that by limiting cars, people feel better. According to source 3, in Bogota, Colombia, they have an event in which driving is banned for a whole day. Violators, of course, would get fined if they don't follow this event. A resident from here, Carlos Arturo Plaza, said that "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" Source 3. This means that cars have been having people stressed out and I know it's true. Imagine coming out of work at three in the afternoon and you have to sit through traffic for an hour. By the time you get home, all you want to do is sleep, rest and relax. Source three also tells us that "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city". It's so much better seeing everyone having fun and getting more involved in their community and not having to sit through rush hour after work. Because many people have been seeing that not being allowed to drive helps us in so many ways, "the Environmenta Protection Agency is promoting 'car reduced' communities" source 1. This will help everyone and they are hoping that public transport will play a larger role in the next upcoming years.  Since people all over the world have been noticing the differents advantages that banning driving has for us, they are actually losing interest in cars. According to source four, "a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...". Instead of making this be seen as a bad thing, it's actually a good thing. As I said before, less cars in the streets means less polluted air. And in this case since young people aren't that interested in getting their driver's license, there will be less accidents and less people dying. For example, source 3 gives us an example of how two adults of the age of 19 and 21 have not bothered to get their driver's license. They just don't make it their priority because they know that they can always just get on the publlic transit, walk, or carpool with their friends.  In Conclusion, banning driving will make people feel better, they will enjoy life more. The air will be less polluted because the streets will not have cars polluting it. Also, there will be less accidents and people will live longer because of this. We will all receive advantages by banning cars. Some peolple might complain at first but they will soon notice, it's all for their good.		0
Dear principal,  I am writing this letter to you regarding your idea of changing the school sports policy, I agree and disagree with what you are trying to do. Have you looked at the Pro's and Con's?  Did you consider that maybe the average C students have been having problems at home and sports is the only fun thing that they can really do? I'd like to know what you would do with this policy if every student willing to participate in school sports was a C or even possibly D student, would you leave it alone or change it?  It would be very unfair if you were to go through with your idea there are for sure students who are trying to be successful in school but do not fully understand the material that we are being taught. You're probably thinking well if sports were so important to them then they should make a better attempt with trying to understand the material being taught like going to tutorials. Well if you looked at the records you should see that there is a greater amount of students showing up.  My other point of view on your idea is that perhaps if they do care for sports so much this would be a bit of a drive for them and they would want to be on the sports team so it would be a win-win situation for both of you. You would win because you'd get to change it for what ever reason you'd like to change it; the student would win because they would be able to join the sports team and get they're grades higher as well. Of course there is no way of telling what the out come will be.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME  8th Grade		0
 The electoral college is a crucial component of the United States presidential election system. Since the system was established, there have been numerous debates and discussions about its effectiveness in determining the president of the country. Some argue that the electoral college system fails to accurately reflect the will of the people and should be abolished, while others believe that the current system works as intended and should be maintained. In this paper, we will examine both sides of the argument, discuss the pros and cons of the electoral college, and ultimately conclude whether the system works or not.  The main argument in favor of maintaining the electoral college system is that it is intended to ensure that the president represents the entire country, not just the most populous regions. Under the electoral college system, each state is awarded a number of electoral votes equal to the number of elected representatives in its Congressional delegation. This means that smaller states have a greater proportional say in the election than larger states. This approach ensures that the president is elected by the entire country, not just the most populous regions, which means that the concerns and rights of citizens living in smaller states are given more weight.  However, the electoral college system can also be argued to be problematic. One of the biggest problems with the system is that it can result in a candidate ignoring certain states or regions entirely. Since states with fewer electoral votes are less important than states with a large number of votes, candidates often focus on winning the more populous states, leading to a candidate neglecting smaller states. This can be a major problem, as voters in these states often feel ignored and neglected by the political establishment.  Another criticism of the electoral college is that it can lead to polarization and the formation of political action committees (PACs). Since winning a state can hinge on the votes of a small group of people, politicians often focus on winning the most urban and densely populated areas. This can lead to the formation of PACs that focus on winning key regions, rather than focusing on issues that affect all citizens, or on building bridges between different regions.  In conclusion, the electoral college system is a vital part of the United States presidential election system. While it has its drawbacks, it also has its benefits, such as ensuring that the president represents the entire country, not just the most populous regions. Ultimately, whether the electoral college works or not is a matter of opinion, and there will continue to be ongoing discussions and debates about its effectiveness in determining the president of the country.		1
Sports and activities. At this point in our lives, who doesn't really do one? Doing things like these keep our minds, and our body's active. It helps keeps us stay focused on our weight, grades, and the way we act. If our principle wanted to move the grade average to a B to play sports, I think that there would be a lot of chaos. Our schools practically revolve around our work, our sports, and our other activities. We are all on the same team no matter who you root for, it's still what we enjoy doing.  If you had to have the grade average of a B to play in any activities, i don't know what would happen. Maybe it could help people bring their grades up, or maybe it wouldn't. You never know til you try something, so it's always hard just to guess. I would go against the grade average being moved up, because I don't think it would really help. Sports or activities are always your choice, whether you want to play or not. Whether you should shoot, kick, jump, tackle, or just close your eyes. It's your choice, and no one else can change that for you.  I also think that if they moved it up, many people would just stop playing. If you don't understand a school subject, and yet you can still pass I think that it's okay. I mean, yes you would want to be able to understand things a whole lot better, but if they're not going to help you in the future what's the point? Getting good grades is a fantastic thing, but if you really want something it all comes down to you. It's your choice to follow your heart and do what you want to do, or to do what's best for you.  Whether you're for, or against something it's still your choice to do what you want. Making choices can be tough, but you can always try to find something out. That's why I would be against moving the grade average up to a B. I believe that it could be a good thing, or a bad thing but you'll never know til you try. Those are my reasons to be against it, but no matter what it's still passing. In the end, it will always come down to your choice, and what's best for you.		0
Dear principal,  All student should get to do sport and other actives if they have a good grade or a bad grade. But if they have a bad grade then the school should help them with the grades but not kick them out of the actives. The child should have warnings and be helped by the school. If a child is missing field trips, class experiments, and other things then he would be losing the enjoyment of the activity. If there was like a system could be set up that would take kids in at lunch and school breaks and help the child learn on the subject that are have a bad grade in.  If the children are getting no help from the teachers then you should be a after school program that the kids have to take if they have bad grades. Not take away activities. Children should force them selves to do work or get there parents to work on homework with them and help them learn after school. The parents should set up a system so they can do learn on the subject that is doing bad.  If most of the school have a grade c average then most of the school is not going to get on the field trips and stuff. If kids have field trips they can learn about stuff and bond with the teachers. For example if a field trip was going to the museum there kids can learn a lot about the artifacts there and how stuff came to be. What if a field trip was going to DC. The kids could learn about how the country came to be, where it all happened, and how it all happened. By these activities kids need them more. This is why I think child should not be limited on the grade average.		0
The author who wrote "The challenge of Exploring Venus" strongly supports the idea of humans studying Venus. Venus is one of the most deadliest planets in ur solar system, but that does'nt stop scientist from wanting to know more about the large gas giant. Scientist are stil fascinated witht his planet and want to travel to Venus. They've sent ships that have failed, and still keep trying. The author effectively shows that Venus worthy planet to study by using facts to show how it will benefit earth.  Most people who hear about scientist exploring Venus think, "Why should we explore an inhabitable planet?". According to the author Venus could possibly have been like Earth thousands of years ago. Paragraph four states, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans ans could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." This proves that the planet had sustained life a long time ago. Venus also shows signs that valleys and mountains could have been there in its sediment. The gas giant is closer to us in distance, humans could easily travel to Venus if the planets harsh conditions can change.  Now that we know life can possibly be sustained there in the future, how do humans get there? Venus's suface and atmosphere is extremely hot and dangerous to humans. NASA has been testing a few ideas such as mechanical technology and simplified computers to help explore Venus. Paragraph seven states, " some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chambers simulating the chaos of Venus's surface." .With this tech humans could possibly be on the surface of Venus without having to fear the dangerous conditions. When this technology gets more advanced scientist will be able to explore Venus with ease.  Venus is a very challenging plant to study and travel to. The author gives credible facts to explain how it could benefit humans. With traces of water and animal life humans could possibly live on Venus. Scientist have been making advances in creating better technology to explore the planet so it can be sustainable in the future. With the information and technology Venus might be in our grasp one day.           		0
Have you ever wondered what another person was thinking or feeling? With the help of the technology called the Facial Action Coding System, you can identify human emotions! There are several reasons why this system is valuable.  One way the F.A.C.S is valuable to a classroom is you can do more things in science contributed to emotions and human qualities. Even if you tried to fake your emotions in the classroom you couldn't. When you first start the process of detecting your emotions, it has to make a 3-D model of your face, and make sure all the mucles move like human muscles. According to the text, "Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness." These special skills can not only help you read people, but also F.A.C.S. teaches you about a whole new life to underatnd people, and they way they feel. Mnay different people will take this system and use it in so many different ways, and try so many new things with it. I personally think that this will be very valuable to normal people like us and, everyday scientists, and especially throughout the school coprorations.  This system is very valuable to the school system, because it doesn't just let you try new things but it can also keep you up to date on how people are doing and feeling. Imagine what kind of experiments you could do with a system like this! 		0
Dear Principal,  I am writing to you to express my opinion on the school's cell phone policy. I understand that you are considering two options, and I wanted to share my thoughts on which one I think is better.  First of all, I think that Policy 1, which allows students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, is a good idea. There are several reasons why I believe this.   Firstly, if students have their phones with them, they can contact their parents or guardians if they need to. This can be helpful in case of an emergency or if there is a change in plans after school. Additionally, students can use their phones to access educational resources, such as online dictionaries or calculators, which can be useful during class time.  Secondly, having phones during lunch periods and other free times can help students to stay connected with their friends and family. It is important for students to have social connections, and having access to their phones can help them to maintain these connections.  Finally, I think that Policy 1 is a good idea because it teaches students responsibility. If they are allowed to use their phones during certain times, they will need to learn how to manage their time effectively and make sure that they are not using their phones during class time.  In conclusion, I believe that Policy 1 is the best option for our school's cell phone policy. It allows students to have their phones for important reasons, such as contacting their parents and accessing educational resources, while also teaching them responsibility.  Thank you for considering my opinion.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
As an average 8th grader, I have to say that technology has had a huge impact on our lives. It's like, everywhere we go, there are screens and gadgets that we can't seem to put down. And while it's really cool to have all this tech stuff, it's also starting to make us forget how to live life.  Like, have you ever been on a hike or a camping trip without your phone? It's like, super hard. You're like, "Wait, how do I take a picture of this beautiful view? How do I check my Instagram? How do I text my friends?" It's like, technology has made us so dependent on it that we forget how to just be in the moment.  And it's not just the hiking thing. It's like, even when we're just chillin' at home, we're always on our phones or tablets. We're not really present in the moment. We're not really talking to each other or interacting with each other. It's like, we're all just staring at screens all the time.  And that's not the only thing. Technology can also lead to feelings of inadequacy and depression. Like, if you're not getting enough likes on your Instagram posts, you start to feel like you're not good enough. Or if you're not getting enough followers, you start to feel like you're not popular enough. It's like, technology can make us feel really bad about ourselves.  But, you know what? Technology can also be really productive if we use it the right way. Like, if we use technology to learn new things, we can become smarter and more knowledgeable. Or if we use technology to connect with other people, we can make new friends and learn about different cultures.  And, you know what else? Technology can have a big impact on our physical and mental health. Like, if we spend too much time on our phones or computers, it can give us eye strain and headaches. And if we're always connected to technology, it can make us feel anxious and stressed out. So, it's important to balance technology use with other activities that are good		1
Limiting car usage has many advantages. The most important advantage is reducing pollution. Vehicles emit greenhouse gasses from their tailpipe. "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse has emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States", as said in source one, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.  One of the main reasons the pollution is so bad in Europe is because of the diesel fuels. According to Reuters, "Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to 53.3 percent average in the rest of Western Europe. Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114, and London had 79.7. The numbers show that there is a direct correlation between the percent of diesel used, and the amount of pollution in an area.  Limiting car usage also helps cities grow. In Bogota, 118 miles of bicycle paths were constructed. Along with parks and sports centers blooming up, side walks have been replaced. Even new restraints and shopping districts have been built. And on top of all this, traffic has been majorly reduced. As said in the exerpt, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , "These people are generating a revolutionary change." Not only does reducing the amount of cars help the environment, it's better for your health. Pollution doesn't only affect the environment, it also damages the body. As the air gets polluted by greenhouse gas emissions, you breath in that air. And that contaminated air is the same contaminated air that is being cycled throughout our body. On top of that, reducing the usage of vehicles would force you to find a new way to get to your destination. You might resort to walking, jogging, bike riding, skating, or anything else you could think of. Limiting car usage would force you to exercise, which is obviously very beneficial to one's health.  Another advantage of limiting vehicle usage is the money that would be saved. Limiting vehicle usage would result in not buying gas as often. And as expensive as gas can get, that would would be a lot of money saved. If you went as far as selling your vehicle, there's even more money that you would benefit from.  So there are many advantages that result from limiting vehicle usage. For one, it reduces pollution, which is bad for the environment, as well as our health. Secondly, it would force us to exercise more. And lastly it would save us a lot of money.		0
Driverless care i think would be lack of motivation, and could cause lazyness. People around the world would want a driverless car, well because they're not driving it. The computer is, it would probably be another episode of WALL-E where everybody gets fat because our technology is to adavanced. If this situation comes in to play, who knows what would be next. If they started to release these smart cars, would that mean that everybody would have to own one? Since they're so safe. I do not think they should have these smart cars put into play, because it would just change the world, maybe in a good or a bad way, but whos willing to take the chance? The cars would probably cost millions also, with the technololgy that is inside the cars, say the smart cars d crash, would they still have them riding around on the streets?  dont really think so. But to the point, if they were to put these cars on the market, it cost people and companies millions, just start a conflict with the world. I dont think its a good idea.		0
The voting system is a very interesting thing. The electoral college is a good system that represents the population in the United States. The electoral college takes into considereation of how big the state is. Based on the population of the state is how many House of Representatives. The more House of Representatives the state has the more impact it will have on the Presendential election due to population. When you think about the presendential election and where the people that are mostly at in the United States the electoral college is a great system because it takes into considerationn where most of the population is.  There is also some wrong with the electoral college. It does have problems as most things do. The single best arguement against the electoral is what some people call the "disaster factor". The disaster factor is that the state legislators are responsible for picking electors, and electors can always defy the will of the people. For example, in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. Therefor a popular vote for Kennedy would not have acually gone to Kennedy. Soem electors have also occasionally refeused to vote for their party's canidate and cast their deciding vote for whoever they want. The worst possible thing with the electoral college is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In thisw case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. Many people do not like the electoral college.  The popular vote is probably the most logical and most simple way to have the presedential election. I think the popular vote shows which president the people of the United States actually want. The popular vote voting system simply counts up all the votes and see which president wins. It is a very simple process. However, the Popular vote means nothing to the Electoral college vote. If a presdident wins the popular vote but gets beaten in the Electoral college vote, the president who won the elctoral college vote wins because that is just how it is.  Both of these voting systems are very interesting. I think the Popular votes barely beats out the electoral college vote for me. The popular vote just seems more accurate and more simple. You should change the voting system to the popular vote for more accuracy. The popular vote is better and will make the United States voting policies better.       ¬†¬†¬†       ¬†    		0
Dear state senator, the people of the state want to choose the president by a popular vote of qualified for what president they want.  The electoral vote college is more like a process that mean it's of 538 electors , if more than the half vote for the president he is elected, but the people of the state want the popular vote because they want to choose their president.  Each candidate going for president has hes own group and the people of the states choose want side they want to be in, and what candidate they want to choose to be the next president, every 4 years they choose new candidates and presidents, in the electoral college the citizens dont vote for their president they vote for the ones who going to be the electors.  The electoral college is outdated, unfair,and is not democratic, thats why the people of the state want the popular vote.  thank you for your time to read this letter.    		0
Body actions say more than words could ever say. This can simply be tested by taking a glance at any individual you may come in-contact with; almost immediately, our brains can process exactly how the other person is feeling. In recent years, this process we do ourselves, has turned to technology. Professor Thomas Huang from the Beckam Institue for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois has worked close by Professor Nicu Seb from the University of Amsterdam, to accomplish creating a computer program that can capture and explain human emotions. After some time, this work in progress became a reality, and was named the Facial Action Coding System. This invention has sparked interest in many different groups of people and in many varying fields of work. One of these fields is education. The Facial Action Coding System can positvely be used in the classroom to improve overall student experience by effectively and accurately catching a glimpse of their nonverbal communication in hopes to result in lesson plan alterations and opening prime opportunities for vulnerability in teacher to student relationships.  This new technology advancement has been found to provide very accurate results based on anatomy; therefore, would be sucessful no matter where it was used. Creator, Dr. Huang, definitely did his research when creating the Facial Action Coding System. The text reads, "Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisley enough to convery specific emotions." Based on this information, it is easy to see that our body language, and simple expressions are simply coded in our human anatomy; Da Vinci knew it and now so do many others. All of the human muscles work together to deliver our innermost feelings and thoughts. The text reads, Eckman has classified six basic emotions -- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness -- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles." This information is essentially the way in which the Facial Action Coding System calculates human emotions in hopes to cause other people to potentially act differently. All humans use the same facial muscles, so this product can be effective on anyone.  Dr. Huang says, "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal...the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)." This piece of text is important to comprehend in order to fully understand the capabilities of the Facial Action Coding System. By using this structured and prepared system the results relayed back to an individual are extremely accurate. As a result of this accuracy, not only could the product be used anywhere; one of the most effective uses would lie in the classroom. In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System uses a sytematic process to determine any individual across the world's emotions; which is an important piece of evidence because many individuals may not believe its' accuracy.  The Facial Action Coding System can effectively used in the classroom to adjust lesson plans based on student preference. One aspect, Dr. Huang mentions is the prevelance of nonverbal communication; especially for young children who are in the education system. He says, "Most human communication is nonverbal, includimg emotional communication." This quote is significant when in the context of the Facial Action Coding System. Within the walls of a classroom this computer program could be used to dig deeper into a students emotions and feelings in order to understand them better and adjust to specific needs. For example, after using this program on a group of kids in the classroom; red flags may appear that gear toward frustration, stress, or confusion and this would give way for a teacher to step in and make a difference. If a large group of students were confused, the teacher would then know they may need to review the topic more thouroughly or by taking an alternate approach. If the computer system can reveal that a student is frustrated, the teacher would be able to console them positively in hopes they would be willing to take part in extra help or practice wihtin a subject. Dr. Huang also mentions, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student in becoming confused or bored." As previously mentioned, by using the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher will be informed of the emotions and feelings of their students that they are unwilling to first hand share with an adult. Overall, this computer program would offer many positive advancements to the classroom that help teachers better prepare for individual student needs and preferences.  As the Facial Action Coding System could contribute to a teacher's knowledge of student reaction in the classroom, it could also make the classroom a much happier place by opening up chances for vulnerability and positive emotions. As previously stated, as a teacher becomes more aware of his or her students' emotions and takes practical steps towards fulfilling their individual needs; a door to vulnerability is quickly opened. Within the walls of a classroom, the relationship between a teacher and student is very important and can make or break a students learning for a short span of time. If the Facial Action Coding System was able to spot a negative emotion, and enable the teacher to step in and help the student walk through that struggle; vulnerability happens in the classroom and can make it a much better place to be. In additon the text reads, "According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them." As the FACS enters into classroom usage, many students will become more aware of emotions they may be unable to verbalize. With this knowledge they may be able to better combat their negative body language and work on recognizing when their emotions may be going down a wrong path and be able to change it quickly. Just as that quote said, making a specific emotion may allow the individual to rapidly improve. Overall, the usage of FACS in the classroom would allow for students to have much more realistic and intentional relationships with their teachers and improve their emotions everyday.  All in all, the Facial Action Codign System is a computer system created that could have many important usages in the future. However, one of the most essential would be within the walls of a classroom. This opportunity would open many positive chances for emotions to be relayed accurately to a teacher in hopes that they would be able to alter lesson plans and change other aspects of their teaching style to better suit individual student needs. In addition, other studies and research completed with the FACS shows that this system can and will relay accurate results because body language is universal and our human anatomy does not lie. Lastly, allowing students to better understand their emotions will help them react to them before they may get out of hand. With early detection and acknowledgement of negative emotions the classroom could become a much happier place to be. This system is going to change the way many programs work, but mostly within the classroom. Teens emotions are always changing, body actions always say more than words could ever.                     		0
For many years now people have been cutting down on the usage of their cars. Their are many advantages to limiting car usage like you become happier, less pollution, and money is spent wisely. many different outcomes come from limiting the amount of time you use your car.  In many countries around the world people have reduced the amount of time they use their cars and the outcome has been phenomenal. Heidrun Walter was asked about how she felt about taking cars out of her life, she answered "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," Rosenthal par3. Cars have been liked stress and when cars were taken out of Carlos Arturo plazas life he said "It's a good opportunity to take away stress..." Selsky par24. When cars were taken out of their lifes they felt happier and stress free.  In these last few centuries we have polluted the world more than anyone else has. This is due our technological advances. One of the biggest advance in these centuries is the motor vehicle. The car has now become a household item. Cars are one of the main reasons why our ozone layer is open and we responsible for "50 percent...of greenhouse gases emissions" Roseenthal par5. It's shocking to see how far we have advanced but to see how much we have destroyed in the world at the same time is crazy. Paris has become so poluted that they had to get a "partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city" Duffer par10. "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after fivedays intensifying smog" Duffer par14. Imagine what would happen if cars were reduced in use for a month.  For many people in these countries they have gotten many benefits back. The government has always used "80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport" Rosenthal par9. Its shocking how much money goes to bulding roads and not things for the development of our communities. The people in Bogota,Colombia have cut back on their use of their cars anf the money the government usually uses for cars or gas is now going to other things. "Parks and sports centers also have boomed throughout the city."Selsky par28. many of the "uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramaticly cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up" Selsky par28. When the goverment did not have to pay for highways or streets they used that money for parks or smooth sidewalks.  Their are many advantages to limiting car usage like people become happierand stress free, less pollution, and money is spent wisely. If everyone cuts back on the time they use their cars the world would be healthier, the population would be heathier and happier, in addition the government would use money for more important things. Reducing the use of cars is step one in the world becoming healthy again.		0
In our daily lives, we are always encouraged to keep busy and to reach for bigger and better things. While completing tasks and taking on projects, we can certainly accomplish a lot, there is also much to be said about moments of inactivity and stillness. Inactivity offers the chance for reflection, rest, and a chance to practice mindfulness.   For example, take the physical activity of yoga. Intentional pauses are taken between poses and postures, which allow for deep breathing, calming the mind and emotions, and balance. Those moments of inactivity help to create a balanced experience and provide an opportunity for increased strength and flexibility, which is the overall goal of yoga.   Similarly, research has shown that pauses in work-related activities are beneficial. These short rests are believed to increase productivity and allow for better and more creative solutions. In preventing feelings of burn-out, moments of inactivity can lead to a higher quality of the work we produce and more job satisfaction.   In conclusion, it is my strong belief that a balance between doing and being is essential to success. Both activity and inactivity serve a purpose and, when incorporated into our lives, can greatly benefit our goals and accomplishments.		1
This country is built on democracy, the idea that all of its citezens have rights and a say in how the country is run. The Electoral College takes away the peoples vote, because in an election, the eligable citezens vote for a candidate, but in reality they are voting for a group of electors who will then vote for the candidate. I believe this is unfair and that the Electoral College should be removed from the country's government.  The first flaw with the Electoral College is that voters cannot directly vote for their favorite candidate. In  Source #2 paragraph 10 , it says; "  ... voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  " If citezens of the United States can't vote for thir own president directly then it takes some of the democracy out of the country. It rarely happens but the electors don't always vote for the candidate with the most popular vote, they can vote for whoever they want, if they really wanted to. This is just one reason I think the Electoral College should be removed, and replaced by a popular vote.  My next reason for replacing the Electoral College with a popular vote is that a tie in the Electoral College is possible. In  Source #3 paragraph 18 , it says; "  A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538-is an even number...  " If a tie occurs then the vote goes to the House of Representatives, but how will they know the feelings of voters if they vote one party for Congress, and another party for president?  My final reason to get rid of the Electoral College is that a candidate can win the popular vote, but lose the election. In  Source #2 paragraph 9 , it says; "...  Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the poular vote but lost the presidency...  " If the people's favorite candidate wins the popular vote, a vote representing the country's citezens, but loses the election because of the Electoral College then the system is unfair to voters.  People supporting the Electoral College may say like in  Source #3 paragraph 19 , "  The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to select a president.  " But this country should be about how the people vote, a popular vote would be the same, no region would have enough eligeable voters to elect a president, so a candidate would have to campaign all over the country.  In conclusion I think the Electoral College should be replaced with a popular vote. Voters cannot directly vote for thier choice candidate, ties can occur in the Electoral College, and a candidate can win the popular vote, but somehow still lose the election. The system is unfair to voters, and this country is based on fairness and rights to all of its citezens, so why should the Electoral College get to take away people's rights?    		0
I think you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it will feel great to help animals in need. From my experience of being a Seagoing Cowboys felt amazing because I was able to go to Greece and had a cargo filled with 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them. I had to feed and water them three times a day. Even though it takes a long time to get from place to place, keeping the animals healthy made me feel happy for me and everbody who participated. That's why I think you should participate in this program.  First, If you become a Seagoing Cowboy it could be fun from time to time. When we were still on a cattle-boat trip, I was able to see Europe and China on the way. Another thing that was fun was that one time me and the crew played volleyball and baseball games where the animals had been housed. Other times we would have table-tennis, fecing, and boxing tournaments to help pass the time. So that may be a thing to enjoy while you are a Seagoing Cowboy.  Next, When you are a Seagoing Cowboy it may open up the world to you like it did to me. From my experience, it made me more aware of people and their needs. So after the long adventure, I had lead my family to host a number of international students and echange visitors for many years. This program had mad me become a better person so, I can help people and their needs. I hope you will do the same too.  Then, when you are a Seagoing Cowboy sometimes it can be intersting but, other times it can be painful. One time when I was being a watchman, I had to watch the animals every hour to make sure they didn't wake up. When I went to make my hourly report to the captain, I had slipped on my backside when I went down a slippery ladder. That day I was lucky to be alive because a small strip of metal stopped me from going into the dark Altantic but I couldn't work due to my cracked ribs. I hope when you become a Seagoing Cowboy, you would not make the same mistake that I did.  Finally, from this huge experience of my life, I had enjoyed it for the most part. From the beginning, I started out as a a simple man then become a Seagoing Cowboy. This is why I highly encouraged you to become a Seaboy Cowboy becuase of all the experiences and fun you can have if you join. Sometimes you can have good times and sometimes you can have bad times, but the impotant part is that you are helping out every country in need. Also you are making a difference in the world and in your personality.    		0
Although the usage of motorized vehicles such as cars and motorcycles still remains at large, there is a significant amount of the global population that have realized the advantages of limited automobile usage. Cars and other diesel or gasoline dependant vehicles emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, which eventually lead to the progression of global warming. Not only this, but whether we notice it or not, cars and the spaces that are required to house cars take up valuable space that we can use for agriculture, the stimulation of the economy through the purchase of goods, even for progression of our education. The using of motorized vehicles is not something that should be banned by suburban life, but it, like its predecessor the transportation means by horse hauling has started to become obsolete.  As shown by Vauban, Germany, a community in which the usage of cars is virtually nonexistent, the extinction of car usage is something to be welcomed like a weight being lifted off the responsible shoulders of your average driver. Driving is not only a what is now viewed as a necessary activity for daily living, but it is also a hazardous chore that we as common citizens must place on ourselves on a borderline daily basis. When driving, we are subjecting our safety to the hands of chance, leaving our lives susceptible to being taken from us by an irresponsible driver, someone who we will most likely never cross paths with again.  "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," says a member of the carfree community Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. Aside from health related deaths, death by car accident is not something that is unheard of, it is actually one of the top theives of life found in the United States alone. It is estimated that a death of a teenager ages 1620 resulting from a car accident happens every 16 seconds. Without cars to drive, there would be no way these accidents may occur.  Within the last century, the rate of global warming has skyrocketed in an almost terrifying way. The natural process that would normally take several millennia to take place without the interference made by humans has been nearly cut by threequarters with the technological advancements that we as a species have made. In three of the four sources, it has shown that the emissions made by fossil fuel dependant vehicles have been the biggest contribution to the advancement of global warming. It is even shown in the article written by Robert Duffer that even a partial ban of car usage in Paris was able to reduce the amounts of smog there significantly.  In two of the articles, it has been shown that with the reduction of car usage, the space that was once consumed completely by these motorized psychological traps can be used to further flourish our enviornment with shopping malls, schools, parks and health centers that are readily available to us. Although we may not notice on a regular basis, but the amount of space that is used to give drivers a place to drive and to give cars a place to inhabit is more than likely bigger than the amount of space that we give an average citizen to live in. In Vauban, Germany 5,500 residents are able to live within a rectangular square mile, whereas a majority of that space in a place like Miami, Florida would be made vacant in terms of living, but prosperous in terms of space taken up by cars. In Bagota, Columbia as a result from their yearly "Carfree day" has increased their amount of publicly availabel park and sports center, and have also improved the sidewalks that are readily available to its citizens.  Physical activity has always been promoted, since we were small children who are incapable of driving. Some would say that we were conditioned to view exercise as the best alternative to driving, and it turns out that our conditioning has been proven as fruitful. Within the last several years, the amount of miles driven per person has decreased by nine percent as shown in the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the amount of those looking to receive their driver's liscense has also decreased. This is not because the generation of millennials has viewed driving as something not to their interest, but because we are conditioned to not want to partake in it. Even if our conditioning was not intentional, it has proven fruitful in terms of the improvement of our awareness of both human lives and the enviornment. Both cars and driving are making their way to ineffeciency, and that is not a bad thing. The lack of cars on the road is something to look forward to, both for our ability to look forward to new technological advancements in transportation and for our longevity as a species.		0
What is the electoral college?¬† The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes.¬† The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster? The electoral college should be diminished because it is an unfair direct election, and the disaster factor.  To begin, by keeping the electoral college we could avoid run off elections.¬† This would help our governmental system because as noted by Richard A. Posner, "There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast."¬† By keeping the electoral college, we could help resolve run-off elections.¬† What we dont know is if it will permanantly work for our governmental system and is it worth the risk? The electors are the ones voting for the president, so we should question whether they should have control to help avoid these run-off elections.¬† The writer notes, "... the pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by electoral college..." (Posner).¬† Although that is true, that is only one problem that would be resolved by the electoral college, and olne benefit is outnumbered by the numerous disadvantages to the electoral college.  Moreover, the disaster facor has a huge impact on the electoral collage.¬† The writer states, "The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse" (Plumer).¬† This disaster was not the first disaster to happen in the system.¬† According to Plumer, the system has had much more effect and damage on the United States and this should not be repeated again.¬† The writer also says, "electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please" (Plumer).¬† This goes to show, not only is the electoral college unbeneficial, but they can be sneaky.¬† The electoral college should be abolished because of the atrocious outcomes it is capable of doing to our government.  Not only is the electoral college capable of the disaster factor, but it also has no direct election.¬† As stated in "What Is the Electoral College?", "... when you vote for your candidate you are acually voting for your candidate's electors." (Office of the Federal Register).¬† This means, voters have no control over whom controls the country.¬† That is outrageous that the lives of these people will be affected by someone they did not want in the overpowering decisions of their country. Writer Plumer states, "At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair too voters" as well as "The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational" (Plumer).¬† Both of these point go to show that the electoral college is lowering our hopes for the government.¬† The writer also notes, "candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states" (Plumer).¬† This proves that the electoral government thinks about their winning chances instead of our countries government.¬† Are we going to sit here and let them take advantage of their power that will lead us towards disaster?  All in all, the electoral collage should be banished from the government.¬† Who wants our government to get weaker and more unfair to the citizens?¬† By taking away the electoral college our government would gain back its strength and become the hard- working government we know it can be!    		0
Dear principal,  I think students should only be required to perform community service if they would like, or have time to. Not all people like to help the community and it would be hard for them to participate in something they don't want to do. For other students who love to help out the community in which they live, they should do community service.  For example some people may have a busy family schedule after school hours or on the weekends. It may be a complication if they had to fit other activities in their daily schedule. It would be only fair to understand family schedules.  Another example is that many other students have school activities after school that they are already dedicated to. Community service could interfere with allowing people to do more of what they want with their lives.  Lastly, some students who live in the community may like where they are but don't think they could be of any help. No one should have to do community service they don't want to. They could already be doing something small to help out but not everyone has time to do something big.		0
Quite often, we find ourselves needing advice on things we don't know much about. On certain occasions, we search for more than one person for it. People may end up gaining multiple viewpoints from doing such, as well as grasping a better understanding on a matter. They may also think their final decisions over more thoroughly.  When multiple people are questioned about a matter, it's not all likely for all of them to have the same viewpoints. In that way, someone looking for advice from multiple people could possibly gain a more unbiased and logical opinion. From an unbiased standpoint, someone could see a situation with an open minded¬†view.  Questioning multiple people for advice often gives more information on the topic itself. When more is known, it's practical for someone to feel less confused than they may have been before they began asking others for help and advice. One may also feel more at ease with knowing more than less.  A person who may not know how to handle a certain situation may become stressed from the lack of knowledge and experience. With acquired information and opinion, it generally becomes easier to ponder over a situation at hand. While knowing the pros and cons, someone could figure a decision that would be best for them and others involved, if anyone at all.  From derived information one could obtain by looking at multiple views, one could gain more knowledge, peace, and less bias overall. In conclusion, it would be a better idea to search advice on situations from multiple people, if possible, than over a singular individual, to avoid bias.		0
 Working with a group or working alone both have their advantages and disadvantages. For me, I prefer working with a group because it allows for collaboration and the exchange of ideas. However, there are times when working alone can be beneficial, such as when I need to focus and complete a task quickly without distractions.  One advantage of working with a group is the ability to bounce ideas off of others. When working with a team, I can share my thoughts and get feedback from others, which can lead to new and innovative ideas. Additionally, working in a group can be more enjoyable, as I can have fun while working on a project.  On the other hand, working alone has its own advantages. When I need to focus and complete a task quickly, working alone allows me to do so without distractions. I can also work at my own pace and in my own preferred style, which can lead to a more efficient and effective work process.  However, working alone can also have its disadvantages. For example, I may not have access to the same level of resources or support as I would when working with a group. Additionally, working alone can be isolating, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and a lack of motivation.  Overall, I believe that both working with a group and working alone have their own unique benefits and challenges. It ultimately depends on the task at hand and the individual's preferences. However, I do believe that working with a group can be beneficial in many situations, as it allows for collaboration and the exchange of ideas.		1
Dear Principal,  I believe that there are many reasons that both students should have phones in school and that they shouldn't. But really, the negatives to this issue outweigh the positives. So I think that your second policy of not allowing cell phones in school is the better choice.  First, cell phones are a major distraction to learning. Even if they aren't supposed to have them in class, many kids still will. Texting will happen in all the classes. Also, when kid's are caught with their phones in school, I don't believe the rule will be clear enough to get them in any real trouble like they most likely should have been.  A second problem to the idea of having cell phones in school is bullying and gossip. The problem has gotten so bad now in schools, that we learn about different types of it in class. It has definitely become a problem . So why add more fuel to that fire? Having cell phones during school would allow rumors and secrets to spread faster, bullies to find victims easier, and even the problem of bullying through technology would be greater. It's already a huge problem, it even has it's own name; Cyber bullying.  Cyber bullying is becoming a huge problem. It has sent many teenagers to suicide. Kids say things over technology they would never say in real life, face to face. Sometimes they do this because they know how mean what they're saying is. Adding to the amount of things that these kids already endure everyday after school through computers, phones, and other communicating devices, letting them have cell phones during school would just make it much worse. I honestly can't think of why anyone would want that to happen to those kids.  Looking from the side of those who think you should choose your first policy, they might say that it's best for the student's safety, in the case of an emergency or personal problem. Which is a good point, besides the fact that there are many phones in the school, most the teachers have cell phones of their own, and the office always has access to multiple phones. Even if every single phone is unavailable and all the teacher's cell phones have been gotten rid of somehow, it is very rare. So rare in fact, that I don't believe it to be an issue. Another thing they might say is that if kids are going to turn them off in class, there isn't a problem. Well, yes there is because most kids won't actually turn them off in class.  If you give them a chance, most of them are going to take it.  Having cell phones in locker rooms and bathrooms could lead to many horrible problems also. Things could be done with cell phones that could ruin someone's life forever. It's not good to even take that chance. I personally have seen something like that happen, and it does not end well for anyone.  My point is that cell phones in school might seem fine, until something bad happens. There may be a few positive things about it, but many negatives. I hope you take this into consideration.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME            		0
The use of the Facial Action Coding System, to read emotional expressions of students, isn't valuable. It is in fact an incredible use of technoogy and it also would be neat to see how people are feeling, but you shouldn't be able to know how people are feeling without them personally telling you themselves. What if there is something someone is trying to hide? Something that is very personal and other people shouldn't know about, but you an see how they're feeling so you insist they tell you.  The technology might not actually work. I t might jut be a scam to make people think that they're feeling certain way about something. It shoudn't be possible to just use a machine to tell how someone is feeling inside.  The Facial Action Coding System was a very clever device. You could see how someones feeling in a picture, in person, you could even see how people feel towards homework. Even though it is a very interesting use of technology, you shouldn't be able to tune into other people's emotions, even if they are your students. Which is why this use of tehnology is not valuable.		0
The advantages of taking classes online or via video conferencing are a great option for students who cannot pay for college, as well as those who had previously been unable to go to college due to financial reasons. Online classes can give students who are working and going to school at the same time the flexibility they need to manage their time and responsibilities.  Additionally, with the growing issue of limited parking space on college campuses, online classes can alleviate a large amount of stress on students as commuting is no longer a requirement for attending class. Online classes can also provide students with a focused environment to learn, without having to worry about the hustle and bustle of a traditional campus setting.		1
Having extracurricular activities at school can be enjoyable for students but they shouldnt be forced to have to participate in them. Extracurricular activities should be a choice not a rule. Most kids have things they want or need to do after school and dont have time to participate in extra activities. Also keep in mind that students need to be able to spend time with their families and themselves. Students shouldnt have to participate in extracurricular activities because students may not have time, also students have other responsibilities than school, students should not¬†have to participate in something that they dont want to do.  Students have things they want to do after they get out of school. If that student has to stay after school¬†they will miss out on the things that they were interested in doing. School takes up the majority of a students day, so students should be able to have that freedom of having time to do the things that they want to do. A students life shouldnt just reflect on school, they should be able to go out and have fun and live their lives without having to worry about school all the time. Students also need to be able to have time to spend with their friends and family.  Students have other big responsibilities beside going to school. Some students may have to go home and take care of a younger sibling or some may have chores that they need to complete. A student may need to be at home at a certain time, extra activities could interfere with that. Students may have pets or other things they need to take care of when they get home. Also, students need time to be able to take care of themselves and practice personal hygiene.  Making it a rule for kids to have to participate in extra activities should not be allowed. Students should be able to participate in things if they want to, not if they have to. Especially, being forced to choose from things that may not fit your interests. Having to be involved with a certain activity can interfere with what students need to complete at home or anywhere else. Activities are supposed to be enjoyable, but they arent when you are required to do them.  In conclusion, activities are better when chosen and not required. Students need to have that kind of freedom where they can choose if they want to participate in something that takes up their time. Students should be able to leave school and have time to enjoy themselves without worrying about school. Students will try harder in activities that they enjoy, rather than what is forced. Students should be able to have a choice of what they want to put their time and energy into.¬†   ¬†   ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬†		0
The development of driverless cars has been a topic of debate. In the article ‚ÄúDriverless Cars are Coming, ?the author presents both positive and negative aspects of these cars. I believe that driverless cars should be developed because they can make our lives easier and safer.  The article states that driverless cars can reduce the number of accidents caused by human error. This is because these cars use sensors and advanced technology to detect and avoid obstacles on the road. As a result, they can prevent collisions and minimize injuries.  Furthermore, driverless cars can make our lives more comfortable. The article suggests that passengers can use their travel time more productively, such as working or relaxing, instead of focusing on driving. This can save time and reduce stress, especially during long trips.  In addition, driverless cars can be more environmentally friendly. The article notes that these cars can optimize routes and reduce fuel consumption, thereby minimizing carbon emissions. This can help address the problem of climate change and promote sustainability.  However, the article also mentions some concerns about driverless cars. For example, these cars may not be able to handle unexpected situations, such as construction sites or adverse weather conditions. Moreover, they may be vulnerable to hacking, which can pose safety risks and privacy issues.  Despite these challenges, I believe that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the risks. With further research and development, these cars can become safer, more efficient, and more accessible to everyone. Therefore, I support the development of driverless cars.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize transportation and improve our lives in many ways. While there are some concerns and challenges to address, I believe that we should embrace this technology and work towards its responsible deployment. By doing so, we can create a smarter, safer, and more sustainable future for ourselves and generations to come.		1
Americans around the world gather around their televisions, frantically waiting to see who the next leader of the USA is. The first Tuesday of November is always an exciting time for American citizens. Citizens watch the number of votes go up, thinking their vote counted, when in reality, it did not. Many people are aware of the electoral college. The electoral college are the ones truly voting for the United States leader. While we may have had this process for years, it's time for us to take a vote to change the way we vote. Citizens of the United States of America should be able to vote by popular vote because the electoral college is outdated and ruins the American freedom.  The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens." Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance techonology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur. This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world. Bradford Plumer of source 2 tells us that in 2000 "Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency."¬† If this is truly a land of democracy and of the people, how could we let such a mistake happen? How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose?  Another factor to this problem is the American freedom. The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, "...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors." American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that ""faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..." We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these "faithless" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.  While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states, it's a one-sided deal. It may be beneficial to candidates but what about the voters? Source 2 reads "during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." If these candidates expect to lead the third largest country (population wise), they should have to put out the extra effort to visit and campaign to every state. The candidates need to show they care for this country and they are here for everyone. If they cannot put in the extra effort to see the lives they are going to change, do they deserve to be president?  All in all, the electoral college is no longer needed to today. The electoral college is made for the modern world and also disrupts our representative democracy. Times are always changing, we, as a society, are always changing, and the electoral college needs to change as well.    		0
### Limiting car usage has many advantages  There are many reasons why we should limit our use of cars. Here are just a few:  * Cars pollute the environment. The burning of fossil fuels in cars releases harmful pollutants into the air, which can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. In fact, the transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. * Cars contribute to traffic congestion. When too many people are on the road, it can lead to traffic jams, which wastes time and fuel. It can also be frustrating and stressful. * Cars can be dangerous. Car crashes are a leading cause of death and injury in the United States. In 2018, there were over 36,000 deaths due to car crashes. * Cars can lead to obesity and other health problems. When people drive everywhere, they don't get enough exercise. This can lead to obesity, heart disease, and other health problems.  There are many things we can do to limit our use of cars. We can walk or bike instead of driving whenever possible. We can take public transportation, ride-share, or carpool. We can also live in a more walkable or bikeable community.  Limiting our use of cars has many benefits. It can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, make our roads safer, and help us stay healthy. It can also save us money on gas, car insurance, and parking.  So next time you have to go somewhere, consider walking, biking, taking public transportation, or carpooling instead of driving. Your wallet, your health, and the environment will thank you.  In addition to the environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on our communities. When people walk or bike instead of driving, they have more opportunities to interact with their neighbors and build relationships. This can lead to a stronger sense of community and a more vibrant public life.  Limiting car usage can also help to reduce urban sprawl. When people live in more compact, walkable communities, they are less likely to need a car. This can save space and resources, and it can also make our cities more livable.  In conclusion, there are many reasons why we should limit our use of cars. It is good for the environment, it is good for our health, and it is good for our communities. Let's all make an effort to walk, bike, take public transportation, or carpool more often. It will make a difference.		1
The author supports further Venus expiditions because of the insight we would gain from it. However, the author seems to forget that these kind of enviromental hurdels take time and money to jump over. A mechanical computer would have slow the process of gathering intel from Venus's surface. Even though silicon carbide electronics sound more appeasing because they last longer, it costs money to buy the materials and build these devices. Rocket fuel is also a bit pricey as it has to have enough fuel to launch and leave orbit and direct itself to Venus. The engineers and scientists have to be paid as well. The author doesn't have an explaination as to where all the money would come from. Venus will chew through the devices and even people we send there.  The idea of sending humans to Venus sounds dangerous, especially since Venus is a hostile enviroment. Venus has a ground temperature of more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit, as mentioned, that temperature will melt tin. If tin can't survive in that heat, so can't humans. The author brings up the idea of having the scientist float thirty miles or more above the surface. This idea seems legitiment except for one thing. Earlier in the article, the author mentioned that the clouds are made out of highly corrosive sulferic acid. The author does not mention how to overcome that obstacle. How are we supposed to explore Venus further if we can't get the money and we can't find a safe way for humans to explore it?  The author does not have many ways as to how to accomplish exploring Venus. Only radical concepts that would only work in a perfect world. They propose these ideas yet they won't elaborate further on them. Maybe this article was meant to inspire some one else to find out a way to explore Venus. However, The author has many ideas, they just need to exlain them. The idea of float in a zeppline above the surface, how do we do that? They need to go into detail as to how we accomplish these things. The author doesn't do a good job of supporting the study of Venus because they don't give an explaination to their ideas.		0
 A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves: The Life and Times of Duke Kahanamoku  Duke Kahanamoku was a man of many talents. Born in Hawaii in 1880 to a white father and a Hawaiian mother, Kahanamoku was a champion swimmer, a renowned cowboy, and a dedicated promoter of Hawaiian culture. Throughout his life, Kahanamoku traveled the world, spreading his knowledge of surfing, rodeo, and Hawaiian traditions to countless people.  One of Kahanamoku's greatest accomplishments was his success as a cowboy. In the late 1800s, when rodeos were gaining popularity in America, Kahanamoku caught on quickly. He spent his early twenties traveling across the United States, competing in rodeos in places like California, Texas, and New Mexico. At first, Kahanamoku focused on bull riding and calf roping, but he eventually took up bareback horseback riding, becoming one of the most skilled cowboys in the country.  Kahanamoku's reputation as a talented cowboy quickly spread, and he gained a following of fellow cowboys and lovers of the rodeo scene. Whether he was competing in a rodeo or simply riding through the streets of a town, Kahanamoku was always impeccably dressed in his signature cowboy gear: a large-brimmed hat, a pair of leather boots, and a bandana tied around his neck in a traditional Hawaiian style.  Despite his success as a cowboy, Kahanamoku never forgot his Hawaiian heritage. He was a passionate advocate for Hawaiian culture and spent much of his time promoting it to the wider world. In addition to rodeos, Kahanamoku also performed traditional Hawaiian dances and surfed, showcasing his impressive swimming skills to crowds everywhere.  Kahanamoku's travels took him all over the world. He spent time in Argentina and Australia, where he taught surfing and cowboy techniques. He even represented the United States in the 1912 London Olympics, winning gold in both the 100-meter freestyle and the 4x100-meter freestyle relay.  Throughout his life, Kahanamoku remained a dedicated advocate for Hawaiian culture and traditions. He worked hard to preserve and promote these traditions, encouraging people around the world to embrace them as well. In doing so, he helped to make Hawaii a more widely recognized and appreciated part of the larger global culture.  In conclusion, Duke Kahanamoku was a man of many talents who made a significant impact on the world of cowboyry and Hawaiian culture. He was a skilled rodeo competitor, a talented surfer, and a devoted advocate of Hawaiian traditions. Through his travels and work, Kahanamoku helped to make Hawaii a more recognized and appreciated part of the world, and his legacy continues to inspire people around the globe today.		1
Asking for advice is a crucial part of making a big decision. Many people ask for second opinions when they don't know what they should do, or can't decide on their own. When you as a decision maker do this, it benefits you by giving you a chance to learn from the experience of others, view your situation in a different perspective, and learn more about your choices. All of these are valuable assets that will help you later in life, and maybe even help others if they come to you for advice. Experience is one benefit that definitely will help later on.  The main reason everyone asks for a second opinion is for experience. People who have had to make your decision before will have experience with what happened to them when they made the decision. This will help you try to find the result that will best benefit you. My friend Generic_Name always asks for the opinion of others when trying to make a decision. A great example of this is when she couldn't take a important test, but didn't know when she should make it up. She asked me what she should do, and I told her that when I missed a big test, I tried to find a solution with our teacher beforehand, like taking the test early, or a few days after the actual test date. Generic_Name knew she couldn't take the test early, as she had another activity taking up her time, but she went to our teacher and asked if she could take it later. Generic_Name figured out a solution by asking others for advice, and found the best choice for her using my experience. Now, she can also use both mine and her experience to make decisions later on inn life. Using my experience to find a solution is not the only way for Generic_Name to solve her problem though. She could have asked for a different perspective instead.  Advice from others come in many forms, but most come in the form of a different perspective. Different perspectives help others understand your problem so they can help you, and also you can now rearrange the pieces of your situation to find a solution.¬†It's always better to look at your choices in a new perspective, because you might find it easier to choose the best one for you from that angle. When I was trying to decide which sleep-away camp I wanted to attend this summer, I had to ask my parents and my friends to decide. My parents told me that because one of the camps was extremely expensive, it would be better for me to go to the other one. My friends, on the other hand, told me that instead of choosing one or the other, I should go to a completely different camp, one that has the activities of both previous camps mentioned and cost less than each one. I did not know about this camp, and didn't even consider trying to find a camp with the benefits of both the ones I wanted to attend. But using my friends' wider perspectives, I was able to find a completely new and customized solution for me. They also could have provided important information about the new camp that I was not aware of to advise me on my decision.  Information is a big asset when making a decision, and you can get that information by asking for advice from others.¬†Different people may know certain things about the decision that you need to make. Asking for advice from these people will allow you to gain this information and make a better choice. A study from Harvard University found that when given the choice, 99% of people chose to make a decision with advice from multiple strangers who has had to make the same decision before. Out of that 99%, 98% believed that the choice they made was the best for them. They also believed that the knowledge they gained from talking to the strangers was a big contributing factor to their success. This study shows how truly beneficial advice from others is. It not only helped people make the best decision possible, but also provided new information for the decision maker, who can now pass on that knowledge to others who need help from someone with experience.  In conclusion, when making a decision, asking for multiple opinions is extremely beneficial. You can learn from the experience of others, choose the right choice more easily when looking at different solutions in a new perspective, and gain new information you can pass on to others, thus helping the whole process come full circle. It will benefit you greatly in the long run as well, as you can use anything you gain from these different opinions in future decision making processes. Clearly, it is always better for you to ask for a second opinion, no matter the decision.		0
" What's wrong with the Electoral College?" To be honest, have you ever thought where our vote goes. Just in case you forgot, when we vote we're not voting for the President. We're voting for slate electors who would vote for the President, but how could we be sure that they make the right decision for all Americn Citizens.  I write this letter in favor to inform you that the electoral college is an unfair advantage for American citizens. I see how from a stand point you may trust the electoral college due to abundance of knowledge and critique they have. Yes, I can tell why you'd chose them in a way that they may have strong critique. But how can you trust them with a decision held in their hands with willing citizens to think about. " At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the " swing" states". Why is it continuing base it off of this knowing how American's feel about this matter? Which brings me back to why Americans have to feel like they have an unfair say on who the President can or could be? Perhaps reasoning is the EC Electoral College knows whats best for the American future. Thinking about the effects of the EC voting for the President could possibly vary in results and mat be right. But shine a little light on the situation, it should be in America's people hands and hearts who the president should be."... candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning..." Why should we feel like that? American's sould have the right to vote for our leader not people who vote for our leader.  Hold on, I'm not finished yet. Another reason why is when American's vote how could we be sure who to vote for. I agree that Americans can make and exercise their decisions when voting for the Eletoral College. American's are depended on voting , another fact I agree on. But American's sometimes dont know better when voting. " The American people should consider themselves lucky that the two thousand fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse. Consider the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people." Sometimes it would be the Americans that throw off the vote for the EC, but in other perspective that wouldn't be the case. Americans should vote wisly upon the information given. but yet the electoral college shouldn't vote for the citizens of the United States, Info should be viewed. I can visaulize someone else perspective it could be with different electorsl parties. But in reverse think about the the biggest election crisis in 2000." Consider the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people". Keeping in mind that we should still vote for our President but at the same keep in mind who citizens are voting for so another voting crisis wouldn't happen again.  In conclusion, I hope you clearly thought it through and thorough. Its hard to rely on other's with a big responsiblity like this. So the Government should let us trust our instincts and but at the same time think them out.		0
Single-use plastic products have been a topic of debate for quite some time now. These products, which include items like straws, plastic bags and water bottles, have been found to have a significant impact on the environment. While some people argue that these products should be banned, others believe that they should continue to be used. In this essay, I will be arguing against the ban of single-use plastics.  Firstly, single-use plastics are incredibly convenient. They can be used once and then disposed of, which makes them very practical for people who are always on the go. For example, if you are out running errands and you get thirsty, you can quickly grab a plastic water bottle from a convenience store. This is much easier and more convenient than carrying a reusable water bottle around with you all day.  Secondly, banning single-use plastics would have a negative impact on businesses. Many businesses, particularly those in the food and beverage industry, rely on single-use plastics for their day-to-day operations. For example, fast food restaurants use plastic cups, straws and utensils for their customers. If these products were to be banned, these businesses would have to find alternative, more expensive products to use. This could lead to higher prices for consumers.  Lastly, while single-use plastics do have an impact on the environment, there are ways to reduce this impact without banning them completely. For example, many companies are now using biodegradable plastics, which break down much faster than traditional plastics. Additionally, recycling programs can be put in place to ensure that these products are disposed of properly and do not end up in landfills.  In conclusion, while single-use plastics do have their drawbacks, I do not believe that they should be banned. These products are incredibly convenient and banning them would have a negative impact on businesses. Instead, we should focus on finding ways to reduce their impact on the environment, such as using biodegradable plastics and implementing more recycling programs.		1
At first, the idea of not using a car may seem like an extreme inconvience that comes with endless problems. However after looking into the matter there are many hidden advantages. One can lessen emissions, and help create a less polluted environment for themselves. One may also be able to save money by simply taking alternate types of transportation.  By using a car less, one can help decrease the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Paragraph five by Elisabeth Rosenthal, states that up to fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are due to passenger cars. While these numbers may seem daunting, some cities have reduced their pollution in simple ways. For example, Paris experienced record breaking air pollution caused by emissions. This drove leaders to put in place a ban on certain cars driving during specific days of the week. Not only did the smog clear within one day, but sixty percent of car traffic was down too. If parishes problem was fixed by making a simple switch, then less polluted cities could easily decrease their emissions swell.  One can also save money by avoiding cars. Not only are cars expensive in the first place, but as explained by Rosenthal in paragraph twenty nine, the bridge and tunnel tolls are rising. Bikes on the other hand, are a great alternative because they are inexpensive and they have free paths. One may argue that it is impossible to get the public to ditch their cars for human powered machines, but in Bogota, colombia, this is already happening. For one day each year cars are banned, and only certain types of vehicles are allowed. Selsky explains in paragraph twenty that millions participated, even on rainy days. Here one can see that this alternative transportation idea is not a couple of people, but a widespread movement.  Overall, lessening ones usage of cars has many benefits. Not only can one help ensure cleaner air, but they can save money while their at it. By making small changes in ones everyday life, huge impacts can be made on the community.		0
dear principle , i think that it is not okay for people to always text of use their phone during school . it can be unsafe for those around and those that are texting or calling on their phones. I think that we should have a look out for people that are texting or calling in class. a lot of people one day are all gowing to get caught with their black berrys and smart phones , and by the looks of it ,a lot of people are gowing to get their phones taken away.  i just hope one day that people are gowing to realise that its not safe .  and its not part of the school rules to use a phone at all. its okay touse a cell phone as long as its outside the school campus and not seen by an teacher.  Phones are okay , but not okay when you fake reading and use your iPhone 4 to talk to your friend in class. and usualy in class a guy would be texting		0
 The cowboy culture is deeply rooted in the history and psychology of the American West. It is a lifestyle and a way of life that embodies the rugged individualism and independence of the pioneers who settled the West. However, what happens when a cowboy leaves the dusty trails of the desert and sets sail on the vast ocean? Can he truly ride the waves like a pro?  The cowboy who rode the waves is an interesting example of a cowboy who transcended his traditional role. This cowboy was a rugged individual who enjoyed the freedom and independence of the cowboy lifestyle, but he also had a passion for surfing. He spent his days riding the waves on a surfboard, just like any surfer, but he still wore his cowboy hat and boots, a nod to his past.  Riding the waves is a challenging sport that requires skill, balance, and courage. It requires you to be in sync with the ocean, understanding its currents and waves, and adapting to them. The cowboy who rode the waves was no stranger to these challenges. He had spent years learning how to ride a horse, how to navigate the rugged terrain of the West, and how to survive in the wild. These skills served him well on the waves, as they helped him stay balanced and control his movements on the surfboard.  But riding the waves is more than just a physical challenge. It is also a mental challenge. It requires you to stay focused, calm, and disciplined, especially in the face of danger. The cowboy who rode the waves had honed these skills through years of experience in the wilderness. He had faced threats from predators, dangerous terrain, and extreme weather, and he had always come out on top. These skills served him well on the waves, as he had to stay focused on the water and navigate through the surf with precision.  The cowboy who rode the waves was an inspiration to many. He showed that it is possible to blend different aspects of life, to find a balance that works for you. When many people thought of cowboys, they imagined them as rugged individuals who could not adapt to change, who were stuck in the past. The cowboy who rode the waves proved that this was not true. He was a cowboy who embraced change, who was open to new experiences, and who was determined to follow his passions.  In conclusion, the cowboy who rode the waves was an interesting example of a cowboy who transcended his traditional role. He showed that cowboys could adapt to change, find new passions, and live a diverse life. Riding the waves was challenging, but the cowboy was up to the task. He had the skills, the mental toughness, and the discipline to succeed on the waves. He proved that cowboys were not limited to the dusty trails of the West, that they could find their place anywhere in the world.		1
Dear, Mr./Mrs. Florida state senator  I am writing to you about the Electoral College and i would like to share my opions with you. As we know the Electoral College chooses the president by having 538 electors and the winning president must have at least 270 electoral votes to claim the presidency. States get a number of electoral voters and depending on the size of the state depends how many voters that state gets, bigger states get more electoral voters and smaller states for example Rhode Island get less. The way the Electoral College is set up it seems that the men/women running for presidency would try to get the minds of the bigger states with more electoral voters to choose them so they can reach the 270 mark. It is clear to me that we have done it this way ever since the founding fathers created it. Its time for a change, the Electoral College is out of date and needs to be replaced with popular vote. Lets not forget the 2000 election when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost because of the Electoral College, Al Gore quite frankly should have won, I mean he did have more votes.  The Electoral College is a system that doesnt work, popular vote on the other hand does work. If the United States of America wants a "fair" election then we should give them one with the popular vote. It is simple and easy to understand, the man/woman with the most votes wins the presidancy. Its time to let the Electoral College go bye-bye, the 538 electoal voters need to leave and make room for a more efficeint election. Most Americans are done with the "winner-take-all" style, if we can let the Electoral College go we can have more "fair" elections, not "winner-take-all" elections. Sometimes though even the electoral voters don't even vote for who won that state they also vote for whom they want to be president. The Electoral College is not effitient, in "1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election," and again in 1976 a tie could have happened if some voters voted the other way, in that case they were only a few votes away from a disaster. If we have the popular vote then canidates would try to get everyone from every state, but with the Electoral College some canidates dont even visit a state or a region they know they won't win over. So that means they will try the bigger states or a region they came from with that said its unfair to the voters.  The Electoral College is a good way for the voters within the college to cheat their way into having the candiate they want to win, win. So if this country wants a more fair vote every four years on a Tuesday after the first Monday then we must have popular vote.  I hope you will take my facts and opions into consideration and give it time to think and discuss what you think, but if everyone wants a more fair election I say we give them one.  Thank you for your time, from: a student from a high school.    		0
 Car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular in the world today, with the focus on reducing pollution and promoting sustainable transportation. Car-free cities are cities that have limited or no cars on the road, and instead rely on alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transportation. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of car-free cities, as well as the challenges that come with implementing such a system.  One of the main benefits of car-free cities is the reduction of air pollution. Cars are one of the biggest contributors to air pollution, as they emit harmful gases and particulate matter. When cars are removed from the road, the air quality improves significantly, and the environment is healthier. Additionally, car-free cities can also reduce noise pollution, as noisy vehicles are eliminated from the streets.  Another key advantage of car-free cities is increased physical activity. When people no longer need to drive to work or run errands, they have more time to exercise and stay active. Car-free cities often have bike-sharing programs and sidewalks, making it easier for people to cycle or walk around. This can help improve public health by reducing the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health issues associated with a sedentary lifestyle.  Car-free cities can also improve economic outcomes. By reducing the number of cars on the road, urban areas can prioritize the use of public and private transportation infrastructure such as bike lanes, bus lanes and pedestrian pathways. This infrastructure can bring economic benefits, such as increased public revenue from public transport fares and reduced costs of running a city's transportation network.  However, implementing car-free cities is not without its challenges. One of the main challenges is how to provide people with access to goods or services without their own cars. This can be addressed through public transportation systems or bike-sharing programs, but it can be difficult to achieve a comprehensive solution that meets the needs of everyone in the city. Additionally, there may be concerns over job displacement among taxi drivers or car rental workers, and the need for businesses to adapt to new transportation systems.  Another challenge is how to manage a city with increased traffic when people are walking, biking, or using public transportation. This can be addressed by creating bike lanes, pedestrian pathways, and bus lanes to separate cars and pedestrians, but it can take significant investment and planning to create such infrastructure.  In conclusion, car-free cities have numerous benefits, including improved air and noise quality, increased physical activity, and economic outcomes. However, implementing a car-free system is not without its challenges, such as providing access to goods and services, and managing increased traffic. Despite these challenges, the growing trend towards car-free cities is an important step towards a healthier and more sustainable future.		1
 Michelangelo once said, "The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving mark." This statement highlights the importance of setting the right goal, or else we will end up missing it. However, there is a better way to express this idea. When people aim to achieve their goals, it's like shooting an arrow to hit the target. To aim it right, you need to focus, believe, think positively, and let go of your arrow to hit your goal. For example, to aim it at the target, you need to focus on your goal, believe in yourself, think positively, and let go of any distractions or doubts.  However, some people don't take their goals seriously and just try to aim for them without putting in the necessary effort. They may miss their shot towards the target because they are not prepared, not focused, negative, and not giving their best effort. For instance, if someone wants to aim for their goal of becoming a successful entrepreneur, they need to study, work hard, have faith, believe in themselves, take risks, be proud of their accomplishments, and never give up. But if they don't put in the necessary effort, they may miss their one shot towards success.  Another example is when people aim for their goal, but they aim too low or too high. The goal is to aim in the middle, but Michelangelo is right in one part because you only have one arrow to make it to the target. It's mostly saying that you have one shot to aim for your goal without making any mistakes. For instance, if someone wants to aim for their goal of becoming a doctor, they need to aim for the middle, which means studying hard, working hard, taking risks, and never giving up. But if they aim too low, they may not achieve their goal, and if they aim too high, they may get discouraged and give up.  In conclusion, Michelangelo's statement is still relevant today, but there is a better way to express the idea of aiming for the right goal. When people aim for their goals, they need to focus, believe, think positively, and let go of any distractions or doubts. They also need to put in the necessary effort, study, work hard, take risks, and		1
There are many advantages that come with the limitation of car usage. The limiting of car useage can help bring down pollution, to help clear the air that we use every single day on a daliy basis. With the limiting of car usage, congestion drops down dramaticly. Also, it helps lower down stress and have an increase in improvement campaigns.  Car usage has a big impact on air. With car usage, pollution increases in the air, but the limiting of car usage can help drop the pollution down. The author, Robert Duffer, stated "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France..." Not also does the limiting of car usage drops car traffic, but the effect from the decrease of car usage drops down polloution in the air.  Improvement campaigns start to increase because of limitation of cars. Constructions start to rise and more communites understand each other more. The author, Andrew Selsky, stated "It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city..." The construction of the 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin Amercian city, was made due to the limiting of car usage and its now one of the biggest ones. Also, parks and sport centers have bloomed throught the city. There have been pitted sidewalks replaced by smooth sidwalks, rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic, and as well as new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.  The limiting of car usage comes with many great advantages like stated. It will help drop down pollution, congestion will drop down dramaticly, and it will help lower down stress, as well as an increase in improvement campaigns. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†    		0
When summer finally begins, the last thing a student even considers thinking about is anything that is school related. The infamous summer project stands to change that. This topic, the summer project, coupled with my predetermined ideologies to what summer should represent lead me to the conclusion that if summer projects are to be a requirement for students, they should be designed by the student, for the student. The reasons students should have the right to design their own projects include, but are not limited to, the fact that giving students a say would let them express, and learn about, themselves creatively, the fact that students can make something they are passionate about, and the idea that summer is not a time to be doing school work.  If students acquire the right to design their own summer projects, they would most likely make the project in a manner that would be both fun and educational at the same time. This is exactly what I did in the 10th grade, when I was assigned a video project in the class Driver's Education. I had never recorded a video for school purposes, and I never learned to edit either. The video project made learning to edit a necessity. I not only learned how to edit because of the video, but I also learned that making and editing videos can be extremely fun! It showed me that I love to make people laugh, and honestly, I may want to pursue making and editing videos one day. Students could choose a video project, or any other way to channel their creativity through this project. In doing so, in choosing how the project is designed, they may learn something new about themselves, and it gives students a chance to show, or maybe even find, their creative side.  By giving students the right to design their own summer projects, you are giving students the chance to make something with the passions they have. This would have an extremely positive effect, as they would now be working on the project with an unconventional mindset, at least in the context of school work. This change in their mindset would make it easier for the project to be done, as the unique things each student loves are being incorporated. This would also drastically increase the quality of work, as they are doing something they love. Allowing students to incorporate their passions would also show teachers how each student is unique in their own way. Student designed summer projects may also create a new interest for whatever topic the project is on, as students would be more inclined to make a cocktail of their interests and school-related topics rather than isolating the two.  Over the 10 months that make up the school year, students are in a constant state of stress, due in part by the work that they must do. Summer is a time for students to unwind, and to forget what it means to be a stressed out, overworked, and sleep deprived student. A time to relax. A time, for once in a student's life, to put the work, and the stress that comes with it, down for an extended period of time. If students are to be required to complete a summer project, they should, at the very least, have a choice in how they will design said project. As it will ease the sting of having to do school work in a time where no school work should be done in the first place. One may say, "Anytime is a time to do school work!" And while I see where they are coming from, school is out of session for a reason. Summer vacation is a time to be away from school and all of the psychological endeavors it brings with it. Which is why I know, definitively, that school work should not be issued out during the summer in the first place, and because of this, if school work is to be issued, the school, at the very least, should give the students the right to design their summer projects.  In conclusion, students, without a shadow of a doubt, should be given the right to design their summer projects. Through designing their summer projects, students can learn about who they are creatively, they can incorporate what they are passionate about into the summer project, and finally, students can feel better about having to do a project during the summer, as they will at least have a choice in what that project is. All of these benefits are extremely valuable, as they will have a positive effect towards a student's life, as they can learn new things about themselves, and show people a bit of who they are. These positive effects would be an impossibility if the flexibility that comes from giving students the right to design their summer projects is not given in the first place.   ¬† ¬†¬†   ¬† ¬†¬†		0
How does asking others for advice help someone make a better choice?  A while ago, a podcast had been going around asking random people one specific question. The question was if asking others for advice on a problem helps them make better choices. Majority of them said that it does help and most of their reasons were similar. I agree that asking for advice from others helps you make better choices. This can benefit you in the way you make hard choices in many ways. Asking others for advice helps someone make a better choice because you can see the persons perspective on the situation, it gives you more options, and you will not have to face the problem on your own.  When you ask for advice from others, you will be able to see and understand the persons perspective on the situation. Seeing and understanding that persons perspective really does help because you might see the problem differently. It will also probably make you rethink your choice. Almost everyone has a different opinion on a problem. The times we face our own problems, we have our own opinion¬†on it. We may see it as a big problem and others may see it as a small one. Eventually, there will be times when we do not need others people advice.  However, when they explain the way they see the problem, you might see it too. You may not like it, but at least you were able to see things differently and try something new.  There might even be a possibility that you might change the others persons way of making choices. Peoples¬†perspective and opinion can change¬†over time  Asking for peoples opinion can give you more options. It is hard to make a choice when you do not have a fresh idea. This will give you the opportunity to think carefully and choose the best choice. Personally, I think that it is easier when you have more options to choose from. Our choices can sometimes make the problem worse. That is why you need to have an open mind. Having an open mind can lead to a better outcome.  Lastly, this benefits you because you will not have to face the problem by yourself. Most of us think that we need to resolve our problem on our own. It is always better to have people by your side when you need to make a choice. Even if it is just one person, that one person can help a lot more than you think. Also, nothing positive will really come out when you do stuff on your own. There is a certain point where you can not do it alone anymore. We are growing more everyday. Growing up comes with a lot of responsibility and with a lot of new responsibility comes hard choices. You will make mistakes and just will want to give up, but making mistakes leads you closer to success. It will not be easy, but all you need to do is trust in the right people, Later on, you will see that the outcome isbetter than you expected.  In conclusion, asking others for advice helps you make a better choice because you can see the persons perspective on the situation, it gives you more options, and you will not have to face the problem on your own. These are the reasons why I personally believe that asking for advice will help you make better choices. There will be times when you have to make difficult choices and you will not know what to do. You may think that you need to do it own. We will face challenges, but there are people who will be there for you. Asking for help does not make you weak. They will help you in making your choices; they will lead you toward your success.¬†		0
Hey there!   So, I know this might sound kinda weird, but have you ever thought about how inactivity can affect our lives? Like, seriously affect our lives?  I know I haven't, but after doing some research, I realized that it's a real thing. And let me tell you, it's not just about being lazy or anything. Inactivity can have serious consequences on our health, relationships, and even our careers.  First of all, let's talk about how inactivity can impact individuals. When we're not moving around enough, our bodies start to suffer. We get tired more easily, our muscles weaken, and our mental health can take a hit. It's like, our bodies are like cars, and if we don't drive them enough, they'll start to break down. And trust me, no one wants a breakdown in the middle of the mall.   But it's not just about us as individuals. Inactivity can also affect our families. When one person in the household is not active, it can rub off on the others. It's like, if one person is a couch potato, the whole family might start to become couch potatoes too. And that can lead to some serious problems, like obesity and other health issues.  Now, I know some of you might be thinking, "But what about all the successful people who are inactive?"  Like, hello, Mark Zuckerberg is a billionaire and he's not exactly the most active guy out there. But here's the thing: being inactive doesn't mean you're not successful. There are plenty of successful people who are active and healthy, like LeBron James and Serena Williams. They prove that you can be successful and still take care of your body.  And let's not forget about the impact of inactivity on employment and economic growth. When people are not active, they're not as productive, and that can affect the economy. It's like, if everyone in the country was a couch potato, we'd all be in a whole lot of trouble.   But here's		1
Peple think that the only way of transportation is by car, well that isn't true. There are many ways in which you can go from A to B without a car. The people have gotten to depenent on cars and it just can't be that way because the gas used to power the cars are whats causing so much pollution and we need to stop that.  For places like china that has the most population in the world since a lot of poeple use cars over there, it made china the most polluted country in the world, which is never good pollution can cause serious problem that we the people do not want. All people have to do drive less and walk more or just drive less you don't even need to walk, but the less we drive the less polluted our world can be the better it is. People in Europe who live in Vauban, Germany which is a suburbed area, most of the people there dont use cars; 70 percent of the families that live in Vauban do not use cars and 57 percent of the 70 should there cars to move there. A population of 5,500 people, more than half of them dont use cars; now that sounds crazy but it works the area is less polluted and that life style is being adopted around the world in attempts to see if we the people can be less dependent on our cars and use them less.  Places like paris have banned driving because of to much smog in the air, and people who cantinued to drive got fined for 22-euros ($31) and more than 4,000 drivers got fined and there cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Also in places like Bogota, Colombia they have a day were people are not allowed to use there cars besides buses and taxis and violaters were to face a $25 fine. That helped promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Other columbian cities have also adpoted this no car free day and are using it to also help with smog.  People do not need to stop driving all around but we need to start driving less to prevent smog and pollution, the less we drive the less polluted our world is, and it takes everyone to do that. In the United states there is a study were every year less people are driving and getting there liscens and that right there is a start. We the people must realize that we can not depened on car to much there are many alternitive ways of transportation we just need to learn to use those ways instead of cars.    		0
 Venus, the second planet from the sun, is a mesmerizing world that has captured the imagination of scientists, artists, and dreamers alike. Known as Earth's sister planet due to its similar size and composition, Venus is a vast and mysterious place that has yet to fully reveal its secrets. The planet's thick atmosphere, crushing gravity, and scorching surface conditions make it one of the most inhospitable places in our solar system. However, despite these challenges, scientists and engineers have been working tirelessly to develop the technology needed to explore Venus and unlock its secrets.  One of the most significant challenges when it comes to exploring Venus is the dense atmosphere that blankets the planet. The atmosphere of Venus is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and is over 95% thick, making it difficult for spacecraft to penetrate. The thick atmosphere also results in a runaway greenhouse effect, which causes Venus to have an average surface temperature of over 400 degrees Celsius (752 degrees Fahrenheit). This extreme heat and atmospheric pressure make it virtually impossible for humans or even robotic vehicles to explore the planet's surface directly.  To overcome this challenge, scientists and engineers have developed innovative technology to explore Venus from above. NASA's Magellan mission, launched in 1999, is a prime example of this technology. The Magellan spacecraft orbits Venus and uses radar to create detailed maps of the planet's surface. This technology has allowed researchers to study the planet's geological features, including mountains, volcanoes, and vast plains, from a safe distance.  However, to truly understand Venus, scientists need to study its surface up close. To achieve this, NASA's upcoming Venus Emissions and Radiometric Opportunity (VERO) mission aims to study Venus' atmosphere by deploying a suite of instruments to analyze the planet's atmospheric composition and behavior. The mission's primary goal is to understand how the Venusian atmosphere creates the planet's extreme heat and how it interacts with the planet's surfaces. By studying Venus' atmosphere, researchers hope to gain insights into the formation of Earth's atmosphere and the potential for extraterrestrial life.  In addition to technological challenges, there are also ethical considerations when it comes to exploring Venus. The extreme heat and pressure on the planet's surface make it one of the hottest environments in the solar system, making it difficult to determine whether life could exist there. The potential for discovering extraterrestrial life raises ethical questions about the impact that our exploration could have on the environment and the potential consequences for any life that may exist.  In conclusion, exploring Venus is a challenging but essential pursuit for scientists, artists, and dreamers alike. Despite the immense technological and ethical challenges that come with the exploration of this fascinating planet, we must continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge and understanding its secrets. As we unlock new discoveries about Venus, we will undoubtedly gain a better understanding of our own planet and our place in the universe.		1
Honesty is a virtue that is highly valued in our society. It is often said that honesty is the best policy, but is this always true? While honesty is important in most situations, there are times when telling a lie might be necessary in order to avoid hurt feelings or potential consequences.  One example of when telling a lie might be necessary is in the situation where a person is terminally ill. If a person is terminally ill, they may not want to know the truth about their condition. Telling them the truth could cause them unnecessary distress and pain. In this situation, it might be better to tell them a lie that will give them hope and comfort. For example, if a person is terminally ill and asks for their doctor's opinion on their condition, the doctor could say that they are improving and that they have a chance to recover. This lie could give the person hope and help them live the rest of their life in peace.  Another example of when telling a lie might be necessary is in the situation where a person is in danger. If a person is in danger, telling them the truth could put them in harm's way. For example, if a person is being pursued by a dangerous person, it might be necessary to tell them a lie in order to get them to safety. In this situation, the lie could be something like "The person who is after you has gone away" or "There is no one after you." This lie could help the person get to safety and avoid danger.  In conclusion, while honesty is important in most situations, there are times when telling a lie might be necessary in order to avoid hurt feelings or potential consequences. It is important to be honest in most situations, but it is also important to be compassionate and considerate in certain situations. We should strive to be honest in most situations, but we should also be willing to tell a lie in order to protect someone's feelings or keep them safe.		1
Distance Learning  The program of education for schools, had develop a way for the students to attend classes from home. Distance Learning , is a program that allows students from an specific region, that has approved this method to assits class by home. They required the students to have access to internet and a computer, because the assignment for the class will be provided in a file with instructions by the teacher in charge of it. I desagree with the distance learning program that would not benefit the students, becuase the better method for learning is seeing the person and oral explenation about the topic giving examples and interaction in the classroom.  First, the distance learning program, can create communication barries. As all the assignmemt are post it online, the student will be most of the time working and doing activities alone. Taking the program at home, he or she won't have the opportunity to demostrate the abillity to work as a team. In result, the issolation of communication can cause conflict in future jobs, as certain jobs assign to work with a partner to find a soluton or to interact with the different ideas that each one has.  Second, distraction in the learning process. Distraction can happen any time while the student is working in the class material. The computer is the essential tool for the work field, and an eassy method for distractions. As the computer have access to internet the student can open many windows at once as, video games, facebook, and many other social media apps with out being notice by the teacher making the learning process longer¬†to complete. No having an educator that supervise his/hers process in work can lead the accumulation of work and the grade might decrease.  Lastly, distance learning program, can cause unscrupulous work. As the assignment are online, and the teacher can not monitor the correct procedure that the students are applying in their assignemts it can cause consecuences. The understament and knowledgemet can be questionable by the teacher, when the student is presenting a well knowledge in homework, but not in thes test of every unit. All this can result in an alegation by the teacher to the student in the way of he/she is not using the rule of plygiarism.  In conclusion, there is not benefit from the students in attending class from from home, becuase it is not productive for the students in certain ways. The correct process of doing class material, is not garanty to a hundred percent. the students can cheat and forget the use plagarize easely. For this reason I do not consider the use of distance learning in the field of education.		0
I have been burdened with the fact that our nation's president is not decided by us but rather by a slate of electors who we vote for. I sincerely feel this is unfair to the people of the U.S.There are many reasons to be against this its hard to choose, but I'll give you my three best ones. The slate of electors could change their political views, the decision for our president is not decided by us insteadby other people and their views ,but most of all its unfair to most states because the candidates only worry about the swing states.  To begin with the slate of electors we choose could change their political views. In the world we live in nothing is certain so if we choose a slate of electors whats stoping them from changeing their view on politics. This problem makes it harder to choose a slate of electors because you are putting your trust in them to represent you, and they can change their views. However ifthe people got to decide their views would be represented by themselves so at least they know their vote counts and it wont be changed. This also takes away the worry of their vote changeing because they themselves voted. And this in the end will give you the president that most people need. So this is one potent reason to abolish the electoral college.  Moreover the president being decided by thers and their viewsis another significant reason to end the electoral college. This country was made to be a nation made by the people,for the people,and by the people.  So if our vote is decided by others that aspect is destroyed. Also if there is a tie in the electoral college the house of representatives decides who is president. The decision will be made by the house of representatives views on politics so you are giving them more power than the people. So the electoral college should be destroyed and the people should decide the outcome. This will let the voice of the people to be heard.  Last but not least most states wont ever even see the candidates because they mainly focus on the swing states. This means that most states wont see the candidates. And if the electoral college is abolished people wont feel left out and they will know that their vote mattered. This will make people feel like their still part of the nation and that their not left out. Also the candidates foccusing on the swing states truly isn't fair to the states with little votes in the college. And that is why the electoral college should be destroyed. And then after this is done the non swing states will feel important.  To concludeI sincerely feel the electoralis unfair to the people of the U.S. There are many reasons to be against this it washard to choose, but Igave you my three best ones. The slate of electors could change their political views, the decision for our president is not decided by us insteadby other people and their views ,but most of all its unfair to most states because the candidates only worry about the swing states.		0
## The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  As a high school student who excels in research, I have been able to gather a lot of information about the advantages of limiting car usage. In this essay, I will use evidence from multiple sources to show that limiting car usage can have a positive impact on the environment, public health, and the economy.  **Environmental benefits**  One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is that it can help to reduce air pollution. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. According to the EPA, transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help to lower emissions and fight climate change.  In addition to greenhouse gases, cars also emit other pollutants, such as particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. These pollutants can cause a variety of health problems, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Limiting car usage can help to reduce these emissions and improve air quality.  **Public health benefits**  In addition to the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have a number of public health benefits. Walking and biking are both good forms of exercise, and they can help to reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, and stroke. By limiting car usage, we can encourage people to walk or bike more, which can improve their overall health.  **Economic benefits**  Limiting car usage can also have a number of economic benefits. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce traffic congestion and improve traffic flow. This can save people time and money, and it can also help to reduce accidents.  In addition, limiting car usage can help to reduce the need for parking spaces. This can free up land for other uses, such as parks, schools, or businesses. It can also make cities more walkable and bikeable, which can attract new businesses and residents.  **Conclusion**  The evidence shows that limiting car usage can have a positive impact on the environment, public health, and the economy. By walking, biking, or taking public transportation more often, we can all help to create a cleaner, healthier, and more prosperous future.  **Misinterpretation of a fact**  In the passage above, I stated that "cars are a major source of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change." This is true, but it is also important to note that not all cars are created equal. Some cars, such as electric vehicles, produce zero emissions. Therefore, it is important to consider the overall environmental impact of a car when making decisions about how to limit car usage.		1
Seeking multiple opinions when asking for advice is beneficial because it allows you to gain different perspectives on your situation or problem. Each person you talk to likely has had different experiences than you and sees the world from their unique viewpoint. By hearing what more than one person has to say, you can get a well-rounded understanding of your options rather than just one narrow view.   For example, let's say you're debating whether to accept a new job offer or stay in your current role. If you only spoke to one friend, they may be biased based on their own career path and push you towards the choice they personally made. However, if you talked to several trusted colleagues and friends, you'd get input from people at different stages in their careers. Somebody early in their career may encourage the new opportunity for more experience, while someone more senior may advise staying put for stability. Considering opinions from multiple vantage points ensures you don't miss important factors in your decision from only seeing it one way.  Furthermore, different people are likely to point out aspects of each choice that you may not have thought of on your own. Even those close to you don't have access to your exact thoughts and likely missed key details. The more perspectives you hear, the more complete a picture you'll develop of both options. Someone could note a downside that had not occurred to you or draw a link between your situation and past experiences of theirs that proved instructive. The accumulation of unique insights and feedback from varied advisers helps guarantee you make the choice fully aware of both its pros and cons.   In conclusion, seeking counsel from multiple trusted individuals provides a well-rounded perspective that allows for a more informed decision. You gain different viewpoints, uncover factors you may have overlooked alone and end up with a clearer picture of your options to choose the best path forward. While any one person's advice could be biased or incomplete, considering input from several sources helps ensure you make the choice you'll feel most confident about in the long run.		1
Sure, here's my essay response:  Topic: The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health  Project Idea: Create a Social Media Detox Challenge  As an 8th grader, I'm no stranger to social media. I'm constantly scrolling through my feeds, checking notifications, and sharing updates with my friends. But have you ever stopped to think about the impact social media has on our mental health? From cyberbullying to FOMO (fear of missing out), social media can have some pretty negative effects on our well-being. That's why I want to design a project that explores the impact of social media on mental health and encourages my peers to take a break from it.  My project idea is a Social Media Detox Challenge. Here's how it would work:  1. Research: First, I would research the impact of social media on mental health. I would look for studies and articles that explore the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes, such as anxiety, depression, and loneliness. I would also consider the potential benefits of taking a break from social media, such as increased productivity and improved sleep quality. 2. Brainstorming: Next, I would brainstorm ideas for the challenge. I would think about how to make it fun and engaging, while also encouraging participants to reflect on their social media use and its impact on their mental health. Some ideas I have include creating a social media-free day each week, taking a break from screens for a certain amount of time each day, or setting limits on the amount of time spent on social media. 3. Plan: Once I have a solid idea for the challenge, I would create a plan for how to execute it. This would include setting up a website or social media account where participants can sign up, providing resources and support for those participating, and promoting the challenge through school announcements, flyers, and word of mouth. 4. Implementation: During the challenge, I would check in with participants to see how they're doing and offer support and encouragement. I would also create a social media account where participants can share their experiences and connect with each other.  Possible Sources of Information:  * Studies and articles on the impact of social media on mental		1
I could see how someone could think that theres some kind of aliens living on Mars and thats what created this human face looking thing. there are more reasonable explantions, then the aliens. This rock formation is actually very comman in mars.  This is a natural formation that happens on Mars. it is very similiar to a formation we have on earth. It was very difficult to figure this out, but thanks to the the new technology we have today we can have better images, and a better understanding of what this is. We have gotten very good answers and clear evidence, even with the difficulties to finding this formation.  It is a more solid, and proven answer to this rock formation. most theories people have created ,dont have good backup infromation in thier statements. In conclusion there are many good reason to why someone could say that alien could of done this, but with the proper equipment we can find out the more reliable answer to this kind of situations.                   		0
While extracurricular activities provide many benefits for students, mandating participation is not the ideal approach. Here is my perspective on the topic:  Requiring all students to join an extracurricular activity limits their freedom to choose how to spend their time outside of academics. Not all interests and talents align with existing clubs or sports, so forcing involvement could cause dissatisfaction. Each individual's circumstances also vary - some may need to prioritize jobs, family responsibilities or other commitments over extracurriculars. Rather than mandating participation, the principal should strongly encourage exploration of opportunities and help students find clubs that fit their unique skills and passions.   If the goal is to teach time management, teamwork and leadership, extracurricular activities can certainly help. However, these skills can also be developed through alternative means such as volunteering, hobbies or part-time work. A one-size-fits-all mandate would not account for the multitude of paths for personal growth. Instead of requiring involvement, the school could emphasize the merits of extracurriculars while still respecting each student's autonomy over their after-school schedule.   Some may argue that mandatory participation would help youth become well-rounded or improve chances of college acceptance. However, quality of engagement likely matters more than quantity alone. Forcing participation could backfire if students strategically choose clubs just to satisfy the rule rather than find activities they truly enjoy. A well-rounded education comes from diverse opportunities, not from fulfilling an obligation.   In conclusion, while extracurricular activities offer tremendous benefits, mandating participation against some students' interests or needs is not ideal. The principal's goal of involvement is good, but respect for individual choices would better serve students in the long run. Encouragement, guidance and promoting the merits of extracurricular engagement are preferable to rigid requirements. Overall well-being, not just credentials or compliance, should be the priority.		1
Dear Principle,  I think having students that cannot part take in sports, unless they have a  B average is outrageous! Students express themselves in sports, B average or not. If my pupils are wonderful at sports but have a C average, and are not allowed in sports is a waste. All that talent would be thrown away if you keep the policy.  Students all want to do something that they love. It keeps there spirits high and they have a good childhood life. I wouldn't want to have a school that is always under the weather because they cant play sports. Kids need time to burn off all there energy to keep them fit and strong. Just having B average or above kids be able is not going to benefit the school in anyway.  Students need motivation in order for them to keep there school work up. If they cant play sports then there grades will drop even lower. The student will feel depressed and confused, if they cant do something that they love. To take away sports for some kids will make them feel like they have had a part of them torn out of them.  The students will work harder if they are in sports. They would want to keep there grades up in hope for a scholarship. Brain cells need activity in order for them to function right. Sitting down all day is tiring and boring. Having all student be able to play sports would also mean less fights. When you are active you burn off those emotions. Students will have a more tight schedule if they play sports and keep there grades up. This will mean less time for goofing off and having bad actions. I hope you take this information into thought, and will disband the policy.  Thank you,  STUDENT_NAME      		0
Have you ever looked at a freind and have no clue what he or she is feeling? well with the new invention the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) could tell what your freind is feeling just by reading their face.  I think the technology of having a divice that could read a human emotions is a impressive and could be valuable.  One reason why I think the FACS is a good thing is because it would be great for the cosulasr at the school that could help ceritain kids out if they are feeling low, depressed, sad and any other negitive feelings. a sentence from paragraph 3 says "Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear , and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscels."  Another reason why i think FACS is a good thing for studenst in the class room is it could read the studnce and if the student is having trouble or confused , the FACS could see it and make the assiment less difficult for the student wich would help alot, I thought this because in the text it says , " A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confusd or bored, Dr. Hang predicts. " then it could modifiy the lesson, like an effective human instructor" this shows that it could be useful for students .  Thses are some reason of why i belive that the FACS is a good thing for students at school .  		0
Relying on others is an essential part of life. We often don't realize the importance of relying on others until faced with a challenge that we cannot handle on our own. This doesn‚Äôt mean that complete dependence on another person is ideal. Instead, we should strive for a balance of individual action and cooperation.  Individuals should strive for independence and self-sufficiency. These are valuable traits, and often, they can carry a person through difficult times. But relying on others gives us the support we need to tackle even greater challenges. It allows us to pool resources and ideas, expanding the range of possibilities. Working with others forces us to think outside the box and break away from our limited perspectives.  More importantly, relying on others helps us to build meaningful relationships. We can learn from their experiences and share our own, creating an environment of trust, encouragement, and understanding. Without these connections, individuals can be left feeling isolated and disempowered.   In the end, knowing when to lean on others and when to be independent is the key to a fulfilling and successful life. Relying on others is not about being weak or dependent; it is about seeing the strength in community and recognizing the importance of our shared resources. With the help of others, there is no end to the heights that we can reach.		1
Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.  Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.  Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.  In concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.   		0
The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Do you disagree or agree with him that all students must participate. Because 1 out of 5 kids do not have extracurricular activities at there school. I agree because the kids can learn some thing new, have help on a topic, and to have fun.  My first reason is that the students can learn something new. When they stay for a new club they can make friends and learn the new skill that the club is teaching . The club is a good way to learn some new things, make some new friends, and learn how to use this¬†skill in life. When you join a club you will learn to love it. For instance not a lot of people came to Girls Who Code until we started to tell everybody how nice and fun it was. Now people are racing for spots¬†in Girls who code. People who come to Girls Who Code will learn about programs and how your favorite game was made.  My next reason is that the students can get extra help in the many of clubs. Some of the clubs such as homework club can help you study. The school provides many clubs to help you with all of your topics. When you come to certain clubs there will be tutors there to help. The tutors are your fellow students that show up to help there class mates. When you stay after to get help your grades will go up by a lot. When they do you will be proud of them that you came too homework club.  My final reason is that the students need to have fun in the clubs. when the parents leave ore work the student is home alone. when the stay after they can hang out with there friends. The different clubs have different activities for the students to learn and have fun. Some kids just want to hang out with other kids. Students have to have some time relax and have fun in the clubs.  In conclusion all students must participate in a extracurricular activity so they can enjoy the clubs that the school has to offer. When they participate in the clubs they will be more ready to learn about that subject.  All of the clubs are really fun and educational.  You schools join a club today¬†¬†		0
Cell phones are a big issue while driving. Lots of accidents have happened in the past because of people being on their cell phones while driving. The main people that do text or play on their phones while driving are teenagers. There are many ways of solving this problem, but I am only going to be talking about one way to solve it.  One way that we can solve this problem is we can put blue tooth radios in our cars so that if someone calls you there would be a way to answer your phone without picking it up. Most of the newer cars have a Bluetooth radio in them so you don't have to buy one. Although older model cars don't have them you can buy them and install them. Over half of the accidents in the us happen because of people being or checking their phones.  Although it is never okay to use your phone while driving I think that if you solved that problem by getting a radio. If you have a Bluetooth radio, then there should be less of a chance of you getting in an accident because you would be on your phone less. Even though that is a solution you should still never touch you phone while operating a vehicle.    		0
In modern society, cars are obviously popular. They are one of the most used means of transportation, and driving can be exciting for some people. Now because cars are so popular today, many wrecks occur consistently. Rather it be because of the person who was driving the car's fault, or another car accidently or purposely hitting the other car, this is why I am against driveless cars. So many wrecks happen already with an actual person driving the vehicle, imagine no one driving the car. The level of safety would not be exceeded, and would rise the statistics of deaths in cars.  First, an issue with driveless cars is not only do we need the technology to make the car driveless, we also have to change our surroundings. "Originally, many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads." The passage explains that some roads will need to be changed for driveless cars to work effectively. These "smarter roads" would need electricle cables to send signals to the car, magnets for alternating polarity and binary codes. Now no one is saying this can not be done because it has been accomplished before, but there will be an expensive price that comes with it. If these prices are not dealt with, no smarter roads and definitley no smarter cars.  Although today, driveless cars technically exist, they are not 100% reliable. "The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel." This places a lot of responsibility for the driver and those seated in the car. Due to the car not being completely driveless, one will have to pay attention to the road, accidents, and where they are heading. If the driver located in the car is not paying attention this can cause car wrecks and even death. To add more safety to the car, the manufactures have created signals. The signals let the driver know when there is danger ahead. But if the driver misses these signals, they are again at risk and their safety becomes their responsibility.  Another problem that arises with driveless cars is the relatonship between the manufacturers and the driver or those in the car. Accidents happen often, and if an accident were to happen it is hard to choose who would be at fault. Would it be the manufacturer who is supposed to create their inventions to perfection for an individuals safety? Or would it be the drivers fault because if something were to happen, they should be aware at all times? "As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars." It is very difficult to answer these questions, therefore safety regulations have been admitted in certain states including California, Nevada, Florida and the District of Columbia.  In conclusion, driveless cars have a long way to go before they can be considered safe. Deaths are skyrocketing as it is with humans driving cars and we certainly are not ready for a car to drive itself. Until we have the proper technology that will work at all costs, driveless cars are useless and better left untouched.         		0

As a student in grade 7, I believe that homework is an essential part of learning. Homework is an opportunity for students to practice and reinforce the concepts learned in class. It also helps develop good study habits and time management skills, which are important for success in high school and beyond.  One reason why homework is important is that it allows students to apply what they have learned in class to real-life situations. For instance, when we do math homework, we are applying the problem-solving skills we learned in class to solve real-world problems. Similarly, when we do writing assignments, we are applying the writing skills we learned in class to express our thoughts and ideas in a clear and concise manner.  Another reason why homework is important is that it helps develop good study habits. When we do homework, we are forced to sit down and focus on the task at hand. This helps us develop the discipline and concentration needed to study effectively. Additionally, homework helps us develop time management skills, as we learn to prioritize our tasks and manage our time wisely.  Some people argue that homework puts unnecessary stress on students. While it is true that too much homework can be overwhelming, I believe that the benefits of homework outweigh the drawbacks. Homework is an important tool for learning, and it is up to teachers and parents to ensure that students are not overloaded with too much homework.  In conclusion, I believe that homework is an essential part of learning. It allows students to practice and reinforce the concepts learned in class, and it helps develop good study habits and time management skills. While it is important to ensure that students are not overloaded with too much homework, I believe that the benefits of homework outweigh the drawbacks.		1
 Driverless cars have been something that people have only dreamed about for the past few decades, but now, that dream is becoming a reality. This is a technology that has been developed to a high level of detail and it  s being tested, and implemented in many areas. Driverless cars use sensors, cameras, and some artificial intelligence algorithms to drive a car by themselves. They can make lane changes, take turns, and even navigate traffic on busy roads. This technology is going to change the way we live in the future.  One of the main advantages of driverless cars is that they can significantly reduce the number of accidents on the road. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 34,772 people died on American highways in 2020 alone, and it  s estimated that 94% of accidents are due to human error. Driverless cars can potentially eliminate all of these accidents because they are equipped with various sensors and cameras that can detect obstacles and other hazards and take the necessary actions to avoid them.  In addition, driverless cars can potentially save a lot of time on the roads. Traffic congestion is an issue that affects cities all over the world, and it can make people late to work, appointments, and other important events. Driverless cars can optimize their routes and help reduce the congestion, allowing for smoother and faster travel. This can also help commuters catch some much-needed rest during the commute, which can be especially important for long trips.  Also, driverless cars can improve accessibility for people who are unable to drive. This can include people with disabilities, the elderly, and those who don  t have a driver  s license. With the help of autonomous vehicles, these individuals can travel to places that were previously inaccessible to them, giving them more independence and improving their quality of life.  The potential for driverless cars to revolutionize transportation is almost limitless. For example, they could be used for delivery services, allowing for faster and more efficient delivery of goods, which could benefit businesses and the economy as a whole. They could also be used for ridesharing services, making it easier and more affordable for people to travel around the city.  In conclusion, driverless cars are a technology that is on the brink of becoming a reality. While there are still some challenges to be addressed, the benefits of this technology are clear. With the help of these cars, we can hope to see a significant reduction in accidents, improved mobility for people with disabilities, and more efficient transportation. The future is bright when it comes to driverless cars, and we can  t wait to see what  s in store for us.		1
Hey there!   So, for this essay, I'm gonna talk about how important it is to persevere when learning something new, being responsible, and being yourself in the world.   First off, let's talk about learning a new art form.  I mean, it's super cool to learn something new, but it can be really hard at first. Like, I'm trying to learn how to play the guitar, but my fingers are all like, "Uh, nope, we're not doing that."  But, you know what? It's important to keep at it, even when it's hard. Like, if you really want to play the guitar, you gotta keep practicing, even if your fingers are all, "Ugh, this is so frustrating."   And, you know what's even better? Volunteering to help out in schools or other places.  Like, I volunteer at my local animal shelter, and it's so much fun!  You get to help animals find homes, and it's just the best feeling ever. Plus, it's a great way to give back to your community.   But, let's not forget about George Washington and Mrs. Locker's King.  They were like, superheroes, man.  They helped so many people, and they didn't even have to. Like, they could've been all, "Screw this, I'm outta here," but they didn't. They were all, "Nah, we gotta help these people, 'cause that's what's up."   And, lastly, let's talk about staying healthy.  Like, it's so important to eat healthy and exercise.  I mean, think about it. If you eat all this junk food, you'll be all, "Ugh, why did I do this to myself?"  But, if you eat healthy, you'll be all, "		1
After careful consideration of the topic, it is clear that there are valid benefits to both working alone and working with a group. Working alone has the advantage of allowing an individual to work at their own pace and without having to answer to or coordinate with other people. Additionally, research has shown that people who are typically given more autonomy and decision-making power over their own work tend to perform better and have more productive results. Similarly, working with a group also has its advantages, as it offers the opportunity to work collaboratively with others to achieve a common goal. Working with a group also allows an opportunity to brainstorm, divide tasks, and have built-in accountability partners. Furthermore, research conducted by Harvard Business Review found that companies that promote collaboration within their teams achieved higher success and out-performed other organizations who relied primarily on individual work.   In conclusion, both working alone and working in a group offer unique advantages. Depending on the individual or the nature of the task, one method may be more advantageous than the other. However, the most successful teams often combine both methods to capitalize on the strengths of both.		1
Advice is needed a lot¬†in life, and when it is needed seeking multiple people for advice is very helpful. Seeking multiple people for advice is very helpful for making a better choice because it gives more overall information and more points of view. when you ask only one person you only¬†receive¬†one point of view and much less information overall, which in the end may be faster but it is less helpful when you need advice.  When you get advice from multiple people it gives you multiple points of views. This is very helpful because it gives different ways to think, and it can also change your mind about what advice you are looking for. When you speak to multiple people it puts you in other peoples shoes and hearing advice from multiple people can make you feel different about the advice your looking for. you could be researching and be stuck to one point of view, but after hearing multiple people, your opinion could completely change.  Another reason to ask more people when looking for advice is there will be more overall information gathered. When you talk with multiple people it helps you understand what you are looking for because you hear more information which helps greatly when you need advice. Looking to multiple people for advice is also helpful just because it will let you know more about what you are looking for, or it will just let you understand what your looking to find better.  talking to multiple people is very helpful when you are looking for advice, because you get more points of view and you get more overall information for advice. There is very little reason to only look to one person for advice when you can look to a few, because with one person you get less information and only one point of view, but with multiple you learn what multiple people believe and you get much more information which will help you much more in the long term. advice is something needed lots in life, but this is why you should ask multiple people when looking for advice.		0
Some students are really busy and do not have time for sports or extracurricular activities while others may have a lot of time and really like stuff like that so I think it should be the students choice. A lot of students have other things to do when they get home but some students may really enjoy doing sports or extracurricular activities. Everybody has a life outside of school or work so they may not have to do any extracurricular activities they may have something going on in their personal life.  I think it should be the students choice weather they do extracurricular activities or not. Some students may have other things to do when they get home and can't do anything. They may really enjoy sports or being on the yearbook, or being student council. Some students could also be doing sports outside of their school distract and cant handle doing two sports at a time. Maybe they are really shy and are scared¬†that they will not make friends. Some students can make friends easier than others.  Sometimes they could just have other things going on in their life. All students have homework so they could be really stressed out about their homework and getting it done. Students also have a personal life outside of school so they could have something going on in their personal life and cant do an extracurricular activity. Sports or any other activity could just be really stressful for some students and they just dont want to do it.  They could really like sports or being on yearbook, or being students council. Some students are really good at sports and other activities and may really like it. Extracurricular actives are not always everyone¬†thing but some students really like it. All students are different and some might just find it easier.  Everyone should chose what they want to do and sports or any other extracurricular actives may just not be what they want to do. Everyone has lives outside of school and you never know what is going on it someone else life. Everyone is different and some people may just not want to do extracurricular actives. Thats why I think students should chose what they want to do.   ¬† ¬†¬†   ¬† ¬†¬†		0

I hope this essay really expired you in excellent, many ways TO BE CONTINED!!      		0
Did you know 4/5 people when asking for advice they ask more than 1 person to get different opinions? When we ask people for advice we tend to seek for more opinions to help us make a better choice. I will talk about why this could benefit your overall decision. For example, seeking for more opinions from a diverse selection of people could benefit you because it would give you a advantage to see pros and cons more and really do research on you major or simplistic decision, Also asking for more than one opinion would help because it would guide you to see who will support you through changes and who will not agree with them, Finally you would also have a better idea who to ask advice for for upcoming or later on major or tiny life decisions. In conclusion those reasons listed are beneficial¬†when asking multiple people for advice.  One way that asking for more diverse opinions is beneficial is because it will show you a vast majority in pros and cons things that may be reasons for the decision but also showing the not so great differences. For example, when someone comes up to you and ask what they should do today you think of everyday activities but you think in depth of why they should do that activity for it may be exciting but draining in energy mapping¬†in your head pros and cons. Another example on why asking more opinions from a large group is important¬†in seeing pros and cons is because, you can envision the similarities in different situations like seeing pros and cons you also see similarities. Lastly, A reason why asking for more than one opinion is important is because you can compare unalike decisions and compare them to one another helping you to get a wider verity in decisions helping you to make the right one.  Secondly, Another reason on why it is very beneficial asking multiple people for advice is important is because it will indicate you the people who will support you through changes in appearance, attitude, etc. Initially¬†going through changes can be hard even if they don't change¬†a lot¬†about you can still leave you venerable to a lot¬†of self damage like insecurities. By asking people you will start to notice a lot or a little majority of people who asked my think of you differently as a person. Secondly, you start to see the people who would not support leaving you will the people who will stick by you through and decisions in life. Also you notice a lot¬†of backlash from people and it may be harsh or may build you stronger but always your are left with the people who are unconditionally¬†supportive of you. In conclusion, by asking a larger verity¬†of people it would benefit you by making decisions is useful because it would guide¬†you where your supportive resources are.  Lastly, A reason on why you should use the method of asking asking a large verity of people when it comes to advice is you would understand more who to turn to on decision making. An example of this all around the world written in books, religious books, themes in stories, and you may have been told this. But when you ask for an opinion on something a wise person would¬†have¬†told you the right thing because wise people have been through the same thing at a different point in life. By getting results by different people on opinions on what you should do may open your eyes and show you people that are open minded that have came across a struggle¬†like you may be trying to overcome. For example, people seem to turn to god by preying. A lot of people may turn to nature to seek a opinion on a path to become happy or any emotion¬†you want to feel. But also I have seen people turn to loved ones and old traditions. In conclusion, by seeking more then one opinion and basing your results on more opinion are helpful because they help you see who you can turn to for more advice in different¬†period point¬†struggles.  In conclusion, when we ask for advice we seek more than one opinion from different people. It may benefit in time because it would give you a advantage to see pros and cons more and really do research on you major or simplistic decision, Also asking for more than one opinion would help because it would guide you to see who will support you through changes and who will not agree with them, Finally you would also have a better idea who to ask advice for for upcoming or later on major or tiny life decisions. So in my opinion using the method of asking more people around you on advice for situations¬†is ideal helping you make decisions that are right and may help you.		0
The impact of technology on the economy and human interactions has been a topic of discussion for many years. The advancements in technology have led to significant improvements in various industries, including Ford, restaurants, and Walmart. This essay will explore the impact of technology on these industries and how it has improved the economy and human interactions.  Ford is an excellent example of how technology has improved the economy. The company's use of technology has led to significant improvements in production processes, which has resulted in increased efficiency and productivity. This has allowed the company to produce more cars at a lower cost, making them more affordable to consumers. The use of technology has also led to the development of new products and services, such as electric cars and self-driving cars, which has further boosted the economy.  Restaurants have also benefited from technology. The use of online ordering systems has made it easier for customers to order food from their favorite restaurants. This has led to an increase in sales and revenue for restaurants. Additionally, the use of technology has allowed restaurants to optimize their operations, such as managing inventory and scheduling staff, which has improved efficiency and productivity. The use of technology has also led to the development of new products and services, such as food delivery apps, which has further boosted the economy.  Walmart is another example of how technology has improved the economy. The company's use of technology has led to significant improvements in supply chain management, which has resulted in increased efficiency and productivity. This has allowed the company to produce more products at a lower cost, making them more affordable to consumers. The use of technology has also led to the development of new products and services, such as online shopping and mobile payments, which has further boosted the economy.  In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on the economy and human interactions. The improvements at Ford, restaurants, and Walmart are just a few examples of how technology has improved the economy. The use of technology has led to increased efficiency and productivity, which has resulted in lower costs and increased affordability for consumers. Additionally, the use of technology has led to the development of new products and services, which has further boosted the economy. While there are concerns about the impact of technology on human interactions, the benefits of technology on the economy and human interactions cannot be denied.		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I think that you should require all students to do community service at least five hours a week. Community service is a good way to teach the students to be responsible and learn to manage their time between school and homework. The students who do the work will learn how much work it takes to keep the community clean and projective. These students will be able to interact with other people that are working in the service with them too. They will be able to take responsibility of their actions. They can also learn new skills depending on the task they take on in the community. Vandals and delinquents who do the services will learn how hard it is to do the tasks and act better out of fears of getting more hours to the service they already have to do .  My friend OTHER_NAME was always acting up in class and causing trouble in or out of school. He just enjoyed being the center of attention because of things he would do or come up with. Later all the things he had caught up with him and he had to serve hours of community service out of it. OTHER_NAME would have to serve a minimum of two hours a day until he does all sixty of his penalized hours. Now he is behaving in class because he learned all those hours of extra work are not worth a couple minutes of laughter. OTHER_NAME has gained more knowledge and responsibility due to all the work he spent paying off his debt and helping all those people. He had to find out the hard way that his were worse than he had. I admire OTHER_NAME for becoming a better student and learning that the way he acted was not the best way.  This is why I urge you to make it a requirement that students serve at least five hour of community service to help out the people who need it. It will help them become better people and learn to be responsible like my friend OTHER_NAME other trouble makers will also learn to be better people. They will be able to learn and give out respect to people when they deserve it. Maybe t they will act out every other while but they will do it less often then they do now without being required to do the work. They will learn to be responsible with how they with use their time and what they do to make those hours every week. The new skills they learn will help them grow as a person and a member of their community. People who don't so their hours should be require to do an extra hours every week until they make it up. These are some reasons why you should make it a requirement to do community work every week.  Sincerely your student,  STUDENT_NAME		0
Can you imagine what would the future be like if there wasn't anymore gasoline for our cars or other thing that we use it for? We can't use gasoline forever with the cars we have today. There are many different ways that we could drive cars without using gasoline. The sun isn't there for no reason. I'm going to tell why i think i see cars in the future, but made different.  Earth does not have a life time supply of gasoline. We can desgin cars in different ways to make them drive. I think cars should be desgin to take over sometimes, but only at times when you need them. There are probably car crashes every day because someone has fallin asleep on the road, or texting, or drunk. Texting and drinking & driving have became a big thing these days for people these days.  Instead of using gas we could use energy for the sun to drive to car. such as solar power. but just imagine how much those cars would cost. Would they cost way more thsn the cars as of today? Would it have to have less people in the car because what if it takes a sertin amount of people bepending on how much people are in the car. Like i said before the sun isn't there for no reason. Many things as of today live off the energy of the sun's energy.  I believe there are so many ways we could drive cars in the future. I've seen videos where the car was suppose to stop on its on sincer in it. The main two things that i think we could use to keep cars running is solar power in water. The Earth is covered with 75% of water and pretty soon the ice up North is going to start melting and land is going to start over flowing with water in the future.  This is why i think we will still have cars in the future.		0
 I agree with Emerson that if you try to do something different of what you are doing, you will grow. However, if you cap doing that same thing, you will never grow. For example, in life, you do different things to know more about that world, you experiment with different things to know things that other people don't know, to become a strong person. Doing different things, you will grow. For example, when you become a father and a man, you change your experiment things that you never imagined how that works. Like some people, they still act like kids because they talk to young men like their age is 17 and 19, this you men they still don't know how to act like men, when their age is 40, that's how you will never grow. Because a man changes to a man is when he is 25, this is that age that you are changing things, and that's the way people get old and they still act like kids.  Other people grow fast because I think that the way that family teaches, like in all families, they are not the same, they grow in different types. Like some families star teach to their kids things that they don't be doing, try to teach the better things. For example, when they are having dinner all together in a restaurant, some parents talk to their kids before they go in. They are having the food they need to be put off they table & phone, to not talk when they have food in their mause at that time, you start grow. In the culture, you be different that other people. Like when you go to other houses, you will be a better person for example, your friend, they say, hey what are you going to do after school, you like to have dinner with my family, you know more better that how your parent teach when you are kids. Because when you are young men, and you still know how that works, you will cap doing that way how you learn. Like other families, they don't that, when they are eat, they use table & phone that way you will never grow, you get to old person, and you will cap doing that same thing that you be doing when you where a kids and I think you main, don't grow.		1
The face on mars is most known as a alien creation , however people don't know if its a natural landform or a alien creation. People who would actually try to look in to it to find facts if its a alien creation or a natural landform.  People don't always think that creations like that can be made by a natural landform. If you see in the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" they give ecidence showing that the face on mars was actually a natural landform. It states " A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see . The caption noted a "huge rock formation ... which resembles a human head," The qoute is saying that when they out the image closer it looks like a human head made by rocks "  "The image first appeared on a JPL website, reavealing ... a natural landform , there was no alien monment after all." According to the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars". This qoute is saying real evidence that there was no alien monument the face on mars was a natural landform.  Although few scientists believe the face was an alien artifact, a scientist named Jim Garvin proved them wrong by saying "What the picture is actually showing is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms comman around the Amercian West." Scientists Garvin is proving that the face was a nautral landform.		0
Have you ever needed advice? Well as it turns out, a bunch of people as have asked for advice. People should seek out multiple opinions when asking for advice because it gives you different views, it can help you think it out, and it opens up more options.  When you ask for advice, you may want different views. First, if you ask just one person, you only have their view on the topic. Only having one person's view doesn't really help you out a bunch. Also, when you have different views, it helps lead you to the correct way. The more views you have, the more it helps you out. Lastly, talking to multiple people helps you find the best choice that suits you. Sometimes someone's view may not suit you well, so asking multiple people can help you find the one that suits you the best. These are some reasons why having different views helps you when your asking for advice.  Most of the time, you need to think the topic out, so getting multiple opinions can help you do just that. First, when you ask a bunch of people their opinions, it can help you think out the topic. When you can think stuff out, it can help you a bunch. Also, when you ask only one person, it can be harder for you to think the topic out. The easier it is to think out, the easier it is to find the best choice for you. Lastly, some people needs to take time to think things out before deciding on what their going to do. Those people should seek out multiple opinions to help them decide what their going to do. These are some reason how seeking out multiple opinions can help you think the topic out.  The final reason is that when you ask more people, it opens up more options to pick from. First, when you ask multiple people, it opens up more options. Sometimes when you ask for advice the might give you something you didn't think of. Also, hearing more options can help you. It is a lot easier to pick from a bunch of options instead of just 2 or 3. Lastly, most of the time, not having multiple options can lead to the person picking a not so great option. The more options you have, the more likely you are to pick a great one. These are some reasons why having more options can help people when asking for advice.  People should seek out multiple opinions when asking for advice. It can give you different views, it can help you think the topic out, and it opens up more options to pick from. And when is all said and done, people should ask a bunch of people for advice when they are looking for advice.		0
Do you have what it takes to be in a classroom? Some people would say that students would not benefit from distance learning because they wouldn't get to be as hands on as the students who are in the classroom. However, students would benefit from distance learning because some students might not have the financial ability to make it to a classroom everyday, there are students that just cant handle being in a classroom environment, and it might just be easier for them to attend classes from home.  To begin, some students might not have the financial ability to attend classes everyday. There are many factors like gas prices that keep students from attending class. For example, there was a girl in college and her parents were very poor. They couldn't afford the gas that was needed to be able to drive their daughter across town to classes everyday. She ended up doing online classes and it worked out great.  Furthermore, there are many students that just can't handle being in a classroom environment. 60 percent of students in the classroom have a mental illness that prevents them from being able to focus. 40 percent of students in the classroom have a hard time interacting with others. For example, in middle school there was a boy and he had a hard time concentrating on the tasks that he was given. Well his parents decided to teach him from home and do online classes and it worked out just fine.  Finally, it might just be easier for students to attend classes from home. As mentioned before, gas prices are extremely high these days and not everyone can afford them. The classes online might be easier than the classes in the physical classroom. For example, let's say you are taking a history class online. The course that is online might be easier because you get to go at your own pace. Taking classes online just might be easier.  To conclude, students would benefit from distance learning. They would benefit from distance learning because some students might not have the financial ability to attend a classroom, there are many students that can't handle a classroom environment, and it might be easier for students to take the online course. So next time you are having trouble in class, try distance learning. You won't regret it.¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
Dear principle TEACHER_NAME,  I think the principle should not force the kids to do community service for their school. i think that for multiple reasons, many people have busy schedules especially people in middle school or high school. A lot of people have sports, after school clubs, a busy life just with the family, goes out with friends or a boyfriend/girlfriend. If the principle then puts community service they might not be able to do it and it could become stressful for somebody who already has a busy life.  Also it could be a good idea because there are a lot of lazy people who don't really get outside to much and the community service could be good for them. Then for bad kids they would get forced to do it as like a discipline thing, or like it could teach bad kids to do good because they are doing good stuff. Or just for kids who want to do the community service. the kids who want a little bit or excitement and achievement in their life. High schools look at community service and volunteer work and those people who want to get into a good high school that will help them.  I say in this situation for wether or not to put in community service to schools i say they have kids choose if they want to do it, for either a grade for school high-school recognition or both. If kids don't want to do it they don't have to but if kids want to they can o eerybody is happy.  Your student STUDENT_NAME		0
Of the many planets in our solar system, Venus would be the worst to travel to. This planet is highly dangerous. The conditions are horrendous, and some people are thinking of traveling there. The cost of building a ship capable of withstanding Venus's conditions would be crazily high. The fact that the author would want to travel to, and support the idea of, Venus is outrageous. Even then, they did not support their claim too well in their article.  Venus is the second planet from the sun. Accoring to the text, the surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Also, the planet has many earthquakes, erupting volcanoes, and often has many lightning strikes that take down probes that wish to know the secrets of the surface. Pressure levels are also off the charts and could crush the ship anyone was travelling in.  The author of the text was not too convincing of their claim to explore Venus. The title itself does not help the claim either This planet, as said by the author, is very dangerous. Traveling to Venus and making sure conditions are suitable for people, is not very achieveable. The author seems to want to travel there and supports the idea, but they do not support their claim very much. Most of the article talks about how perilous the planet is for people to travel to. They could have supported themselves better if they talked about the benefits instead of only the dangers.  All in all, travelling to Venus would be a waste of time and money. If NASA risks the lives of people by sending them, then the trip would be for nothing. With the dangrous conditions to consider, the contemplation of whether or not to travel there is out of the question. The answer is no. It's too unsafe to put peoples' lives on the line only because scientists are curious about a dangerous planet.		0
 In today's digital age, the idea of attending classes from the comfort of one's own home has become increasingly popular. While there are certainly advantages to this approach, such as increased focus and flexibility, there are also potential drawbacks that must be considered.  One of the main advantages of attending classes from home is the increased focus that students can bring to their studies. Without the distractions of the classroom, students can more easily concentrate on their work and achieve their goals. Additionally, attending classes from home can provide students with a sense of control over their own education, allowing them to study at their own pace and on their own schedule.  However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. For example, students who attend classes from home may struggle with social isolation and lack of interaction with their peers. This can be particularly challenging for students who are new to the school or who are struggling to make friends. Additionally, students who attend classes from home may struggle with time management and discipline, as they may be more likely to procrastinate or become distracted by other activities.  Another potential drawback of attending classes from home is the lack of access to resources and support that students may receive in the classroom. For example, students who attend classes from home may not have access to the same level of support from their teachers or classmates, which can be particularly challenging for students who are struggling with their studies. Additionally, students who attend classes from home may not have access to the same level of technology and resources that they would in the classroom, which can limit their ability to complete assignments and participate in class discussions.  Overall, while attending classes from home can have its advantages, it is important for students to carefully consider the potential drawbacks and to ensure that they have the necessary resources and support to succeed in their studies. This may include seeking out additional support from teachers, classmates, or online communities, as well as developing strong time management and discipline skills. By taking these steps, students can maximize the benefits of attending classes from home and achieve their academic goals.		1
February 22, 2011  Principle TEACHER_NAME,  As a student that participates in sports, I know how myself and the other athletes feel about the new academic standards. Many students have been working on raising their grades, and this can be achieved only if time is allowed. I understand that this school strives for academic excellence, but students also need exercise and after-school activities in order to succeed in and out of school.  Students have learned how to make time for studying and sports, and have kept to the previous standard of an overall C average. I believe many of these students' grades would drop if they did not have to keep to those standards. They might also drop if the students weren't also challenged in other ways. My fellow students agree that we can all keep a B average, but should not be penalized right away due to the short notice of this change.  Raising a grade does not happen over night. These students will still be studying as much as possible, and doing their absolute best on all assignments as usual. Of course, tests can be weeks apart. The school should have a testing period before they decide the new policy is the official one. During this period, no student should be penalized.  Sports keep students focused. If you suspend the student from an extra-curricular that he/she loves, the student won't be trying to learn, they will be trying to memorize enough to barely pass. By accepting that students can achieve the acceptable average while still playing with their team, both parties will be happy in the end. Especially while this new standard is still being thought out.  The athletes believe they should be allowed to keep the C average standard for the rest of the 2010-2011 school year. If the school board still in the end decides to make their new standards the official policy, the students will be coming in with a new attitude on the first day.  The school's standards have been effective for some time, each student graduating and moving on to exceptional high schools; some even with sports scholarships! Why would the school want to change a good thing? Our school has pride due to academic, religious, social, and sporting excellence. By allowing students to work at their own pace, the school will be able to keep their high standards and reputation.  Please consider this proposal because it comes from the core of the school - from the students themselves. They know that it is possible to keep to academic standards while participating in something they love. By working together and hearing all sides of the argument, I am certain that a final decision can be arranged; one in which all parties are happy.  Thank you for all of your time and consideration,  John Doe,  Student and Athlete of SCHOOL_NAME      		0
 Online learning has revolutionized the way students can access education. With the advancement of technology, students can now attend classes from the comfort of their own homes. This has made education more accessible and flexible for individuals who may not have had the opportunity to attend traditional schools.  One of the biggest advantages of online learning is that it allows students to attend classes from anywhere in the world. This is particularly beneficial for students who live far away from a traditional school or who have other commitments that make it difficult for them to attend classes in person. With online learning, students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, which can save them time and money.  Another advantage of online learning is that it allows students to learn at their own pace. In traditional schools, students are expected to keep up with the pace of their classmates, which can be challenging for some students. With online learning, students can take classes at their own pace, which can help them to better understand the material and achieve their goals.  However, there are also some potential disadvantages to online learning. For example, some parents may be hesitant to enroll their children in an online school because they may not be able to monitor their child's progress as closely as they would in a traditional school. Additionally, students may miss out on the social aspects of attending a traditional school, such as interacting with their peers and participating in extracurricular activities.  Overall, online learning is a great opportunity for students who may not have had the opportunity to attend traditional schools. It allows students to attend classes from anywhere in the world, learn at their own pace, and save time and money. While there are some potential disadvantages to online learning, the benefits far outweigh the costs.		1
To the principle  I have heard that you are considering to require all students to perform community service. To be honest I think it's a great idea. But some students don't think it will be. But there is a large variety of things you can do for community service. For example, there is cleaning up litter, tutoring, cleaning other peoples yard, and a whole bunch of stuff.  I think the one that is well liked by students is tutoring younger kids. It's actually a lot of fun! It actually makes you feel like you are a teacher. The younger kids will ask you a lot of questions about how to do their homework. But most of the time they catch on to it pretty quickly. Of course you will think that their stuff is easy. But remember, you more than likely had the same problems when you were their age. If students like tutoring other students, they will probably encourage other students to consider students for tutoring. Then maybe the principle will consider making it an elective for the school. Of course it won't be mandatory but it could be for students that enjoy tutoring younger students in a lower grade level. By my opinion, it's probably the most enjoyed by students than doing other stuff.  Most students enjoy cleaning up their environment. For example, they clean up litter, pick up after pets, and growing trees and planting flowers. Some students get straight to it right after school. But most of the time students do it on their free time. I say free time because they probably have electives after school or play sports. Most students play sports after school to get a scholarship for a college they want to attend. Their practice only lasts for an hour or two. The best thing about community service and playing sports is that you have a lot of time to clean up your environment. Instead of cleaning up the environment, kids like to plant flowers and trees. I say the easiest thing to grow is flowers. Trees take longer to grow a full height then flowers take a couple of days. Trees take months or years to grow! Besides flowers come in a variety and you can choose what you want to grow. Trees grow into whatever they want to.  The last thing kids might interested to is cleaning up neighbors yards. Some people pay the kid like 5 dollars but some people don't pay them at all. It doesn't really matter if you get paid or not. You are doing a nice thing for your neighbor. He or she should appreciate that. Sometimes you just have to mow the lawn or pick up trash. So it's not really that complicated to clean up someone's yard. Well i guess it depends on how big the lawn is. If it's huge, then it wouldn't be hard to pick up trash but if your mowing the lawn, it might take you some time to finish. But on a good note, you did something nice for someone. They probably can't do it because they could be injured or something.  Those are a couple of things you should consider doing for the school.		0

Reducing car usage has several environmental and social benefits for communities. One of the main advantages is improved air quality. According to Sources A and C, vehicle emissions are a major contributor to air pollution in cities. By using cars less often and switching to alternative modes of transportation like walking, biking, or public transit, there would be fewer pollutants released into the atmosphere from vehicle exhaust and gas stations. This would lead to cleaner, healthier air for all citizens to breathe.   A second advantage of limiting car usage is reduced traffic congestion. As explained in Source B, a large number of private vehicles on the roads causes traffic jams during rush hour periods. By having fewer vehicles on the roads at these times if people chose other options, the flow of traffic would improve considerably. Commutes would be less stressful and time-consuming for workers and other drivers. Less idling time in traffic also means fewer emissions generated from more free-flowing traffic patterns.    A final benefit highlighted in Source D is improved community interactions. When more people walk, bike or take public transit rather than driving separately in cars, there are increased opportunities for casual social encounters and conversations between neighbors, friends and local residents. Stronger social bonds and a greater sense of community can develop from these interactions in public spaces rather than isolation inside private vehicles. Overall quality of life would increase in neighborhoods with reduced car reliance and more alternative transportation usage.		1
I think its a good idea to ask people for other people opinion because people might have better thought on something, they can have different options for you, and it also can help you later in life.  I think we should ask people for there opinion because they might have a better thought. For example if you wanted to go shopping for cloths and you dont know which one to pick. People will give options of what they think and they can tell you which one they prefer more. There are variety options you can pick from. You can choose your own and ask people if they like it or not. If you dont know which one to pick between two options. You can ask friends, family, or anyone you feel comfuterble¬†with you can get an idea which one you want more. Its always a good thing to ask for people opinion.  Asking for people opinion is good they can have different options for you. You can ask on different flavor of ice cream you can get as many options as you want . People can give you differnt opionions on what they think which ice cream taste better than other ones. different options is always a good thing to use. Its bad sometimes haveing only one option the more options the better. The more options you get you wont have problems with picking things of what you want. It is easier to to pick and and you can have what you want.  All these opinions can help us out later in life. In the future you might need help on which flavor ice cream is good. You can ask someone and they can give you an opinion which one is good. Its good to have opinion some of them you might not like. Everyone dont have the same opinion which is okay everyone can have different opinion on different types of things. over time you might need an opinion on something and you can thing what people have said before or you can ask someone to help you out.  Different opinions and thoughts can help you more in life and you wont have problems with picking things. its good to have different opinions on different things that people give you. All these opinions people give you can help you later in the future and different kinda of opinions. I think it is better choice to ask someone on thier opinions and get an idea of what other people think about different things.   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
The Electoral College shows many reasons why we should change it to popular vote. Like for instance The Electoral college is not fair, but by voting with popular vote not only will more people vote but more people will vote for who they want to vote and not get confused and vote for the wrong candidate.  Theres many reasons why the Electoral College isnt fair like, how Bradford Plumer stated during the 2000 campaign a variety of states that didnt vote because of not being able to see a campaign ad and they did that because some candidates dont focus on the states that they know theyre not gonna win. But by voting with popular vote you get to vote for who you want, everone gets to vote because every state would be equal and people would vote for the president and not for the slate of electors.  yes, maybe the Electoral College could be good for something for like winning. Also if you think about it, it could be worse like even worse than the 2000 fiasco election, and plus the Electoral College avoids run-off elections so thats a good thing if you want a clear winner.  Other than that popular vote is much more sufficient than Electoral vote because its much more fair and with popular vote everyone votes on who they want to vote and every state gets the same, equal treatment as the others.    		0
Some schools offer distance¬†learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. In other words, Students should have the option of attending a public school or online school at home. If students choose to do online school at home, the education should be the same as public schools. Some individuals may disagree because they believe students will not to do their work, or take online school serious. Students should have the option of taking online school at home because their able to get a full night sleep, allowed to start online school whenever they want, and can control how fast or slow the lessons are going.  Students are able to get a full night sleep. Studies have shown that students should get about seven hours of sleep per night. On an average school night most students get five to six hours of sleep. On a normal school night, that is the most students are going to get. The biggest reason why students do not get a lot¬†of sleep is because they stay up doing homework. Most people in high school¬†either have activities or sports they are involved in. These activities can make individuals tired to the point where they end up doing their homework late at night. Students should have the option of doing online school so they are able to sleep in, and feel well rested in the morning.  Teenagers have the ability start school whenever they choose. In this time period teenagers are treated like young adults and our capable of making decisions by themselves. If the student feels tired in the morning, there is no start time for online school. For example, if there is a test they have to take the individual should be well rested and not tired. In Virginia, most high schools start around seven in the morning. These students are still teenagers and their brain has not fully developed yet. Teachers expect students to have gotten plenty of sleep the previous night. In fact, some students only get three hours of sleep which is not good for the body or the brain. With being said students have the opportunity on when they can start their lessons for school.  High scholars have the option of going at their own paste. Everyone is different and moves at a different speed than some people. With various classes students have to pass, not every student will quickly finish them. People tend to take a longer time with math, and may need extra time to understand the concept their learning. With taking school online you will not have a teacher at the front of the class room teaching. If you are a student who understands what is being taught, you dont have to wait on others to understand the concept. Working at your own paste can possibly help the student stay on task, and help them learn the lesson more efficiently. By working at your own paste and slowing things down can potentially help the student in a positive way.  Offering online learning for students at home might be beneficial to students. If students got nine or ten hours of sleep each night, their grades for their classes could be very high. With getting nine or ten hours of sleep students could start school in the middle of the day if they wanted, feeling well rested. Everyone is different in their own ways, and taking some classes in a slower paste doesnt hurt the student. If some schools offered online school for students to attend at home, this would open a positive aspect¬†in a students life.¬†		0
Dear Principal,  A large majority of students in our school have cell phones. Cell phones are big now because of texting, chatting, emailing and whatever other stuff a phone can do. They are a great way to communicate with other people. Maybe you want to meet someone somewhere it's easy enough to just pick up your phone and send the person a quick text message or call. Lots of teenagers have them. But cell phones are also a major cause of problems. I do not think you should allow kids to have their phone on them during school hours.  There are bullies in every school no matter where you go, there will always be some sort of bully. They take can take embarrassing pictures or videos of you and send it out. It will spread like wild fire once you take that video and send it out to even one person. But a lot of the time bullies take these pictures/videos on their phones because that is all they have handy. They can take an inappropriate picture of you and send it out. During school someone could take out their phone and take a picture or video of you doing something when you really don't want your picture or video taken. People have killed themselves over getting bullied because there is a picture out there of them that they personally don't like and wish no one had ever seen. Well that picture can originate from a bullies cell phone. It's easy enough to take a quick picture and send it out. If you were to let kids have their phones that might happen more often.  On the other hand, another reason why I don't think you should let us kids have our cell phones is because it will distract from someone learning and that is what school is all about. If someone had their phone they would most likely text one of their friends. Therefore they are distracted from the lesson the teacher is trying to teach and they will not get what is going on in that class. Also I have seen people text each other answers to a test. This is very common for students to do because they do not know what is going on because during that lesson they were to busy on their phone or just being distracted. Texting another person the answers to a test or quiz is cheating.  Yes, I would love to have my phone to text all my friends but there are more important things like learning. Again, I do not think you should let us kids have our cell phones with us because it will lead to bullying and also cheating. It can lead to many other things, but those two are the main problems of having a cell phone on during class.		0
Yes, I do think School's should offer online class;¬†for¬†the students who live far away, or any students¬†who would like¬†to take a¬†online course. It is very beneficial for students who learn better in a quieter environment. There are up's and down's for online classes. Some positive things could be, Its taken online, where ever you want, on your laptop, computer, smart phone, tablet. Some negative things could be, you feel like you have enough time to finish your work but the deadline sneaks up on you or if you have bad internet. It has for me, when I took an online course over the summer.  I once took an online class through my public high school. It was terrific, I had received a total score of eighty-eight percent¬†in that online course. The course I took was Algebra two, and I took the course¬†over the summer when I was in Generic_City. I did have many complications when I was there. I had terrible internet over there, because I had many cousins visiting and so many electronics devices were connected. The online course site was terribly made, it wasn't student friendly at all. The site¬†froze many time when I was using it. It had many other computer bugs too.  The only¬†good thing about the online course¬†that I liked, was that you can turn in your assignment any time before the course actually ends, it will not cause you to lose points. When I was taking the online course, I wasn't doing much I was just goofing around with my cousins and not getting my assignments submitted. I was really behind by four or five¬†chapters. When the deadline was coming up, I started doing the assignments after everyone was asleep. I stayed awake for three days straight, until I had finished all my assignments.  Online classes are really beneficial for the students who like to work in a quiet area, also the students who don't like to come to school. These online classes take nine months of information and work and fit¬†it to three months of work. Schools should have online courses for the students who want to take¬†it.		0
The Face on Mars, is it really what NASA says it is? The Face on Mars is really what they say it is;a face on Mars. Most belivers in the alien world believe that aliens did do it, while most scientist do not. I am a scientist at NASA working on the "project" and most scientist believe that it was just a giant mesa or a "mountain" or something that was formed by natural effect.  I see why most belivers, in aliens, believe that aliens did it; its out of the ordnary,just not answerable,or because it's more questionable than anything. Now you can go around saying that aliens did do it, but be positve and ahve evidence on why you think that. In April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Cydonia, for the first time ever, and snapped a very "sharp" picture of the "site'.  Web surfers were anxious while waiting for the image to be reveled on the JPL web page. The image showed what appeared to be just a natural landfoorm, not an alien monument or anything that had to do with aliens at all.  The belivers in aliens were still not satiisfied on the image they had seen on the internet due to the weather that day. Belivers thougth that the alien makers were just covered up by the haze or fog. Then the next time on April 8, 2001 on a cloudless day the "reasearchers" spotted the face again after a complete orbit around Mars and snapper another quick shot. It wasn't as easy as it sounded, they had to roll the spaceraft 25 degrees to the middle so you could see the face entirely.  After they had gotten the second picture they "blew it up" and made it 3 times bigger than its original size. When that happened, you could see anything and everything else that was around on the planet in that particular spot, if there were any airplanes or any other pyrmids. The picture acutally showed that it is the, Martian equivalent, size of a buttle or (a. k. a. a mesa) which are landforms most commonly made by nature in the American West.  "It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," says Gavin. "Thats's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."  I hope this has convienced you to believe that the picture is real and that aliens did not build it and that the pictures and people that have spoken told you that it is just a natural landform that was created by "mother-nature."       		0
As an eighth-grade student, I believe that implementing a program in high school that allows students to finish their course classes ahead of schedule would have numerous benefits for students. First and foremost, it would prepare students for college by allowing them to complete their coursework early and take more advanced classes. This would give them a head start on their college applications and increase their chances of getting into their preferred schools.  Additionally, finishing classes early would give students more time to be with their families. High school can be a stressful time for students, and it's important for them to have a strong support system at home. By finishing classes early, students would have more time to spend with their families, which could lead to stronger relationships and a more fulfilling life.  Finally, finishing classes early would provide students with extra time to work on their personal interests and hobbies. Many students have passions and talents that they would like to pursue, but they don't have the time to do so because of their busy schedules. By finishing classes early, students would have more time to work on these interests and potentially even turn them into a career.  It's important to note that finishing classes early does not mean that students can slack off and not work hard. In fact, hard work is crucial for success in any aspect of life. By working hard and completing their coursework early, students will develop important skills such as time management, self-discipline, and perseverance. These skills will serve them well in college and beyond.  In conclusion, implementing a program in high school that allows students to finish their course classes ahead of schedule would have numerous benefits for students. It would prepare them for college, give them more time to be with their families, and provide them with extra time to work on their personal interests. While hard work is crucial for success, it's important to remember that it can bring blessings in many ways. By working hard and completing their coursework early, students will set themselves up for success and fulfillment in all areas of their lives.		1
 Based on my experiences, I would say that it is not entirely true that people cannot change. In my opinion, people say that because they are not interested in the person they are talking to or meeting.  The first impression is not always accurate, and it is not a definitive judgment of a person. People can change and grow over time, and it is important to remember that first impressions can be misleading.  One reason why people may not believe that the first impression is impossible to change is because it can be influenced by external factors such as a person's mood or environment. For example, if a person is not having a good day, they may not be comfortable talking or having a conversation in that moment.  If I had to give an example, I would say that my relationship with my best friend started off on a rocky foot. The first time we met, he was not interested in talking to me and did not want to be my partner. When I asked him about problems I was having with math, he ignored me and did not answer.  However, over time, we got to know each other better and became good friends. This shows that the first impression is not always an accurate representation of a person, and that people can change and grow over time.  In conclusion, while the first impression can be misleading, it is not entirely impossible for people to change. People can grow and develop over time, and it is important to remember that first impressions can be influenced by external factors.		1
 In today's world, it can be challenging to find authenticity in the midst of a sea of fake people. It is easy to get caught up in the desire to fit in and please others, but ultimately, being true to oneself is the most important thing. In the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, "To be Yourself in a world full of fake people is the greatest accomplishment."  While it may be tempting to try to fit in and be like everyone else, the truth is that people will always treat you like a piece of garbage no matter what you do. It is a waste of time and energy to try to be someone that you are not just to make others like you. Instead, it is much better to be yourself and be happy.  It is also important to remember the importance of cultural heritage and not to forget where you came from. Many people are ashamed of their roots and try to distance themselves from their past, but this can lead to a sense of disconnection and a lack of identity. It is much better to embrace your culture and share it with others, rather than trying to fit in with a new group.  Additionally, it is important to remember that trying to make others feel inferior in order to feel superior is not a healthy or productive way to live. It is much better to focus on your own personal growth and development, rather than trying to tear others down.  In conclusion, being true to oneself is the greatest accomplishment in a world full of fake people. It is important to remember the importance of cultural heritage and to avoid trying to make others feel inferior in order to feel superior. By focusing on our own personal growth and development, we can create a more positive and authentic society for everyone.		1
 If you're considering pursuing a career in business, it's essential to explore your interests and gain practical experience through internships and shadowing opportunities. Many schools have partnerships with companies that offer these types of experiences to help students discover their passion for a particular occupation.  As a student interested in pursuing a career in business, I believe that I have the skills and qualities necessary to make a valuable contribution to your company. I possess strong communication skills, a positive attitude, and the ability to come up with innovative ideas. I am also a hard worker and have experience working with others in a professional setting.  During my time working as a makeup artist at a salon, I developed a strong understanding of the beauty industry and gained valuable experience working with clients and managing a team of artists. I also had the opportunity to work with some of the biggest names in the beauty industry, including Anastasia Beverly Hills, Morphe, and Huda Beauty. My ability to learn quickly and adapt to new situations would be an asset to your company, as I am always looking for ways to improve and grow.  I am passionate about pursuing a career in business because I believe that I can make a positive impact on the industry. I am eager to learn more about the opportunities available to me and am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to your company. Thank you for considering my application.		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  Many people believe it is appropriate to take care of our community.  Whether it is helping someone in need, or picking up a couple of cans off the side of the road.  Although some people think that this is a great opportunity to make our community a better place, some people find it as being a waste of time.  They don't see the importance of community service.  I find it very important to help out in my community.  Every little gesture of kindness is great!  In my opinion, the people who don't want to help out, are selfish.  They would rather spend time benefiting themselves than to benefit others.  It is also a sign of laziness.  What people don't understand, is that helping out in our community is fun, and if its the right kind of job, it will earn you credits if you are in Honors Society!  If you are not in honors society, it just might be on a college application!  Having community service on there might get recognized when it comes to finding a job these days.  So TEACHER_NAME, I think you should require all students to perform community service.  It could be a great way to help our children in school(if they are tutoring), making our community look nicer(by planting flowers, trees, etc.), and to teach them respect for their community.  This could be beneficial to everyone here in Brunswick County.  But why stop there?  Spread the word!  We could tell our friends in South Carolina to make their community a better place!  If we keep this going, our world will be a better place for everyone to live in!  Thank you,  Student at SCHOOL_NAME      		0
If you thimk it is a alien civilisation you are mistaken. If you think it is where is the evadence like houses. I think it is a natural land like we have here on earth. It can be an astriod hiting the earth or it could very well be a mountain like we have on earth. Another thing i think it could be is an un earupted valcanneo like an other thing we have on earth. Also it can be where the inside of the planit has bin pushed out to cause a natural land form. There can also be other things it can be. The people that think that it is an alien civilisation they have to back there rason up with a lot of information and very detaild information to get me on there side. Even then I probibly wont believe them it would have to be a very low chance i would take there side.		0
 The topic of extracurricular activities and their impact on students is a widely debated one. While some argue that schools should control students' involvement in such activities, I believe that the decision should be left to the students themselves. This is because extracurricular activities play a crucial role in helping students learn how to manage their time effectively, make new friends, and increase their chances of getting into college.  Firstly, extracurricular activities can help students develop important time management skills. By participating in such activities, students are forced to create a schedule and prioritize their tasks. This can help them learn how to effectively manage their time and become more responsible. Additionally, extracurricular activities can help students develop a sense of commitment and follow-through, which are valuable skills that will serve them well in the future.  Secondly, extracurricular activities can provide students with an opportunity to make new friends and develop important social skills. By participating in activities with like-minded individuals, students can learn how to communicate effectively and build strong relationships. This can help them develop a sense of belonging and improve their overall well-being.  Finally, extracurricular activities can help students increase their chances of getting into college. Many colleges look at extracurricular activities as a way to gauge a student's interests, dedication, and potential. By participating in activities that align with their interests and passions, students can demonstrate to colleges that they are well-rounded and have a lot to offer.  In conclusion, I believe that the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to the students themselves. By allowing students to choose their own activities, we can help them develop important skills, make new friends, and increase their chances of success in the future.		1

Working alone and working in groups are two different approaches that people often use to accomplish tasks. Each approach has its own set of advantages and disadvantages that need to be considered. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the pros and cons of working alone versus working in groups, and consider the implications of each approach in terms of understanding the work, reaching a successful conclusion, and fairness.  Working alone has its own set of advantages. For one, it allows for a high level of focus and concentration. When working alone, individuals can work at their own pace and tailor their approach to the task at hand. Additionally, working alone can be more efficient, as there is no need to coordinate with others or wait for their input. This can be particularly beneficial in situations where time is of the essence.  However, working alone also has its own set of disadvantages. For one, it can be isolating, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection. Additionally, working alone can limit the amount of perspectives and ideas that are considered. This can lead to a narrow focus and a lack of creativity.  Working in groups, on the other hand, has its own set of advantages. For one, it allows for a diverse range of perspectives and ideas to be considered. This can lead to a more well-rounded understanding of the task at hand and a more creative approach. Additionally, working in groups can foster a sense of collaboration and teamwork, which can be beneficial in both personal and professional settings.  However, working in groups also has its own set of disadvantages. For one, it can be more difficult to coordinate and manage the group's efforts. This can lead to conflicts and delays. Additionally, working in groups can be more time-consuming, as there is a need to wait for others to provide input and coordinate efforts.  In terms of understanding the work, working alone can be more effective, as it allows for a high level of focus and concentration. However, working in groups can be more beneficial in terms of reaching a successful conclusion, as it allows for a diverse range of perspectives and ideas to be considered.  In terms of fairness, working alone can be more fair, as there is no need to consider the contributions of others. However, working in groups can be more fair, as it allows for a more equal distribution of work		1

Venus is the second planet from our sun. Venus is also the most like Earth. We know little about this plannet. One thing is for sure we do know is, it is dangerous. Is Venus worthy of pursuit even though it is dangerous?  The author of the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" propposes it is a fantastic idea. The dangers are a small risk to take to gain more information about this planet. The author states all of the following reasons to support his point.  Venus is the most Earth-like planet, this may mean that the planet could support other life forms. It is the closest in size and in some cases distance to Earth. Venus has shown to have earthquakes, erupting volcanoes and lighting. These are all things that happen on earth as well and no other known planet. Venus probably had large bodies of water at some point as well, making it able to support life forms of some sort. The structure of Venus is made up of rock, valleys, mountains and craters. Earth and Venus have multiple simalarities.  There are also many dangers to visiting Venus. The atmosphere is made up of 97 percent carbon dioxide and has great amounts of highky corrosie sulfur acid from clouds. The pressure on Venus is 90 times greater than Earth. A huge danger is the temperature of the planet. Venus can get to over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. All of these things are a hazard to life.  The author of the article states all the pros and cons, but also states the knowledge that would be gained. As the phrase goes knowledge is power. The Information gained from pursuing Venus would be a huge advancement in history.		0
Drivers should not use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There are a few key reasons why cell phone use behind the wheel is dangerous and should be avoided.   Firstly, cell phone use is a major distraction for drivers. Talking, texting, or otherwise interacting with a phone requires the driver's visual attention to be directed away from the road. This increases the likelihood of the driver not noticing potential hazards like other vehicles or pedestrians. Studies have shown that driving while distracted is as dangerous as driving drunk. The brain needs to focus entirely on the complex task of navigating traffic safely. Even hands-free phone conversations siphon away too much mental bandwidth to stay fully aware of one's surroundings.  Secondly, cell phone use increases reaction time in emergency situations. When a prompt response is needed to avoid an accident, a driver on their phone simply cannot react as quickly as one with their full attention on driving. Braking distances and the ability to maneuver are diminished. The extra seconds it takes to process road conditions while distracted can mean the difference between a near miss and a collision. Reaction time is a critical factor in avoiding accidents.   Finally, the act of holding and manipulating a phone physically takes a driver's hands off the wheel. This further impairs control of the vehicle and ability to respond to any rapid change. Driving requires having both hands on the wheel to steer as needed. Taking a hand off to hold a phone leaves much less control available in split second situations.   In summary, cell phone use, even hands-free, introduces too much risk and potential for distraction while driving. The complexity and responsibilities of operating a multi-ton vehicle on public roads require full attention from drivers at all times. For safety reasons, cell phone activities should be avoided entirely until the vehicle is safely parked. Lives could depend on drivers remaining focused only on the road.		1
   The electoral college is an institution within the United States that is responsible for electing the President and Vice President of the country. It is a system that has been in place since the country's founding, and yet it remains a topic of debate among Americans. Some argue that the electoral college is necessary to ensure that the President of the United States is elected in a way that is fair and just to all citizens. Others argue that it is an outdated and unfair system that does not reflect the will of the people.  On one hand, proponents of the electoral college argue that it is necessary to prevent a candidate from winning the presidency by winning just a few large cities or states. In this way, the electoral college ensures that the President is elected by a diverse group of people from across the country. Additionally, the college system allows for the possibility of compromise when it comes to the selection of the Vice President. By allowing for the nomination of candidates for Vice President by the parties, the electoral college allows for the possibility of bringing together a winning ticket from different ideological backgrounds.  On the other hand, opponents of the electoral college argue that it does not accurately reflect the will of the American people. In recent elections, candidates have focused their efforts on winning over swing states and states with a high number of electoral votes, rather than caring about the needs and desires of the people. This has led to a situation where candidates often neglect smaller states that have a lower number of electoral votes. Additionally, the electoral college can create a situation where a candidate wins the popular vote nationwide, but still loses the election because they are not able to win over enough electoral votes in key battleground states.  Ultimately, the electoral college is a system that has its benefits and drawbacks. It is necessary to ensure that the President of the United States is elected in a way that is fair and just to all citizens. However, it is also necessary to make sure that it accurately reflects the will of the American people. It is important that future Presidents and Vice Presidents be elected in a way that is fair, just and accurately reflects the will of the American people.  In conclusion, The electoral college works but it must be reformed to reflect the will of the people. There are no clear-cut answers, but the country must continually examine the system and strive to make it better. With any system, there will always be advantages and disadvantages, but with ongoing review, it can be continually improved upon to reflect the changes in society.		1
Participating in extracurricular activity like, sports or any clubs is good for any student so they can make new friends or learn new activity's. Activity's can boost your health, social skills, and interest on a activity. For example students could play soccer and basketball or join a art club.  Playing soccer or basketball is a great activity to play. Playing soccer is a fun sport for spring or summer in the outdoors, while playing basketball in the fall or winter is great for indoors. Playing soccer can help you with stabilizing health, producing more leg strength, and making new friends. Basketball can also help with producing arm strength, making new friends, and maintain health. These sports activity's¬†might motivate students to play on an actual team and win games or even win a big championship game.  Participating in an art club is a really fun activity for creative students. Being in an art club is really cool because students can create paintings, make clay sculptures, and adapt on social skills. Students can make art for yearbooks, book covers, or even posters for upcoming events in school. Students might even have the chance to make art and bring it to a art event for school and win contests. Joining an art club can help with creativity, making new friends, and help with big events.  In the future, students might have the potential to use there creativity and help build structures or art around the world. Playing sports could possibly make students play for big leagues and be famous around the world. Participating in sports or clubs can boost any type of skill like, social skills, maintaining health, or motivation skills.		0
A project over the summer is a great idea for students to continue to learn. On the other hand, allowing teachers to decide on what students should create isn't the best idea. In the summertime, students love to have fun, create new things, and discover. Leaving the project up to them could challenge their creativity and work ethic. It's not only fun for students, but fun for teachers to see what the students bring back.  During my fifth grade science fair, we were allowed to conduct any experiment we wanted. I decided to blow bubbles and see which gum brand made the biggest bubble. This was fun to do because it was what I thought that made it a successful project. In my opinion, I became proud of myself for taking initiative for completing the assignment on my own.  In addition, when it was time to present my own work I didn't have any problems. I knew what I was talking about and it gave me confidence in front of the class. Sharing all the information I was articulate and when answering questions I was assertive. My teacher was surprised with the quality of my lab and she knew I had put lots of time and effort into this.  Nevertheless, In a teachers perspective of giving a controlled project to students is necessary. They don't always see where things could go wrong. A student could be confused about instructions and do the project completely wrong. Some might feel like it's boring and a waste of time. Giving the student the freedom to illustrate and present their own idea is the most creative way to learn.  Therefore, students designing their own project ideas surpass teachers. Making it fun to learn instead of what might feel like a burden. Teachers determine effort and creativity for the most part. It's up to students to demonstrate correctly. Could you do it on your own?¬†		0
Standardized tests are a common sight in schools across the world. While many believe that these tests provide an accurate measure of student ability, others beg to differ. In this essay, I argue that standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability due to a number of reasons.  One reason why standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability is that they do not account for the different learning styles of students. Not every student learns best in a structured testing environment, and therefore, some may perform poorly despite being talented learners. Additionally, standardized tests do not take into consideration that some students may have different levels of English proficiency, which can make it challenging for them to fully understand what is being asked of them in the test.  Another reason why standardized tests cannot be considered an accurate measure of student ability is that they tend to be biased towards certain demographic groups. For instance, some studies have shown that standardized tests tend to be biased against minority groups and low-income students. This is because these students often do not have access to the same resources and educational opportunities as their more affluent peers. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that these tests accurately measure the academic abilities of all students.  Finally, standardized tests are not always the most effective measure of student learning because they only test a narrow range of subjects. Many standardized tests focus heavily on core academic subjects like math, science, and reading but fail to take into account subjects like art, music, and physical education. This means that some students may excel in these non-academic subjects, but their talents would not be reflected in the standardized test scores.  Overall, it is clear that standardized tests do not accurately measure student ability, as they fail to account for different learning styles, are biased against certain demographic groups, and do not reflect a student's full range of talents. As such, schools should focus on other ways of evaluating student achievement, such as project-based learning, teacher evaluations, and portfolios that take into account the diverse strengths of each student.  In conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability, and schools should find alternative ways of evaluating student achievement. By doing so, they can ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background, learning style, or academic strengths.		1
If we have access to the greatest technological innovations of human history, shouldn't we be using them to allow students to choose the way they want to learn? Schools have started to incorporate modern technology into the classroom, where schools are surrounded with screens instead of chalkboards and laptops instead of binders. Thus, as technology becomes easier to integrate with learning, many schools have started to give the option of learning¬†through online software rather than sitting in a classroom. I believe that students would be able to benefit from learning through online or video conferencing, because they would be able to learn in a method that is more convenient, less stressful for students with social issues, and more helpful through the use of learning with online media.  Rather than having to sit in a classroom, online learning would allow students to learn in a way that makes them feel the most comfortable, increasing the convenience and ease of learning. The goal of school is to empower students to learn and gain knowledge that will ultimately help them later in life. Therefore, schools should assess what methods allow students to gain the most amount of knowledge in a given amount of time, thus increasing the efficiency of learning. Schools have tried various methods of increasing efficiency, such as making high school start at a later time or making the cafeteria food more healthy. However, these past changes fail in that they do not tailor the school experience based on one's need. Furthermore, if a student learns best at night time, they do not have the option to take their high school schedule at night. Or, if a student learns best on a couch instead a desk, they have to settle with sitting in a desk for most of their day. These examples show that the best way of increase learning efficiency is by giving choice to the students, and online learning gives much more choice compared to traditional school. Students are not tied to sitting in a classroom or learning at specific points in a day, allowing them to choose the way they learn the best. Thus, convenience and choice from distance learning allow students to gain more knowledge and be more successful later in their jobs. Some may argue that the convenience would lead to a lack of physical interactions at a school, isolating students from developing relationships with their peers. However, since distance learning gives students more choice, they can choose how and when they interact with their peers, allowing social relationships to be built on their own time rather than during school time.  Online learning would decrease stress for students who have social issues attending school. For example, some students with mental disabilities have issues being surrounded with hundreds of other students at school. Luckily, online learning can allow these students to receive their education without having to be around others, which makes learning a much easier process. In addition, I have noticed how social media has made many students develop anxiety over social interactions at schools. However, online learning can allow these students to be less focused on social dilemmas at the hallway and more focused on their studying during school time. Therefore, distance learning can be useful to combat the social problems that distract many students from learning at school.  Finally, online learning can make the learning process more engaging and useful to students through the use of online software. For example, I have taken a course online through a program called Virtual Loudoun, and I noticed how the curriculum involved the use of online slide show¬†presentations, videos, and diagrams. This made my learning process much easier, since the various methods of learning kept me more and engaged and interested to learn. Although some classrooms have implemented presentations and videos, most still largely revolve around teachers lecturing to the class, which does not engage students nearly as well as other online methods. Some may argue that online learning does not allow for students to get specialized or individual help if they have issues. However, online learning still retains all of the traditional benefits that come from learning in a classroom. For example, if a students needs specialized assistance, they can easily setup a video conference to talk individually with their teacher. Also, online software can allow students to take quizzes, tests, and assignments at certain deadlines, and teachers can easily grade their work and upload their results to a grade book. Therefore, online learning has all the advantages of normal classroom learning, on top of increased engagement through the use of different learning methods.  Overall, distance learning with the use of technology is the future of learning as it allows students to choose where and when they learn, have less anxiety for those with social issues, receive a better education through the use of online media. All of these example will allow empower students to be more successful once they eventually enter the workforce. Traditional classrooms have been around for hundreds of years, and it's time that society evolves and transforms the way that students learn by using technological innovations.		0
The Author support the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers Venus is actually a planet. in our system solar. Venus is the second planet from our sun. Venus is the closest planet planet to Earth in terms of density and size. Venus is sometimes we are closer to  Mars and others time to Venus. On the planet's surface, temperatures averange over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.  Venus was probably covered largely with Oceans and could have supported varios forms of life just like earth, today Venus still has some features that are sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters, furthermore, recal that Venus can some times be our nearest option for aplanetary visit people like visit at planet Venus they want know about the planet. The scientists say tha planet is delete at de solar system because Venus is a little planet in solar system it was delate. approaches to studying Venus. for example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and lasted for trhee weeks in souch conditions. human curiosity know more about Venus the little planet in solar system. In planet Venus there not are life, people can live there at the planet Venus, Only in this planet are life.		0
Zoos are like, totally awesome! They're like, super important for conservation and stuff. Like, they help us learn about animals and their habitats, and they help us protect them too!  One reason zoos are so cool is because they help us learn about animals that we wouldn't normally see in our daily lives. Like, have you ever seen a penguin or a giraffe in person? I know I haven't! But, like, at the zoo, you can see them up close and personal, and it's like, whoa! It's so cool to see them in real life, and it makes you appreciate them so much more.  Another reason zoos are important is because they help us protect animals. Like, zoos have breeding programs for endangered species, and they help reintroduce them into the wild. It's like, super important to protect these animals, and zoos are doing their part to help.  For example, like, the Toronto Zoo has a giant panda breeding program. They're like, the only zoo in Canada that has giant pandas, and they're doing their part to help protect them. It's like, so cool!  But, like, some people might say that zoos are bad because animals are in captivity. They're like, "Zoos are prisons for animals!" But, like, I don't think that's true. Zoos are like, super safe for animals, and they have, like, experts taking care of them. It's not like they're just, like, stuck in a tiny cage or anything.  Plus, like, zoos are doing their part to help animals in the wild too. They're like, working with conservation groups to protect habitats and stuff. It's like, super important, and zoos are, like, leading the way.  So, like, in conclusion, zoos are, like, totally important for conservation and education. They help us learn about animals, they help us protect them, and they're, like, super safe for animals too. So, like, let's keep zoos around, and let's keep learning about and protecting animals!  Please grade this essay and provide feedback.  Grade:  Feedback:  This essay provides a clear and passionate argument in favor of the continued operation of zoos.

With some attention to sentence-level grammar and mechanics, as well as more specific examples, it could be even stronger.		1
I am a vegetarian and I believe that reducing meat consumption is beneficial for both our health and the environment. Therefore, I strongly advocate for adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet.  Firstly, reducing meat consumption can have significant positive impacts on our health. A plant-based diet is rich in nutrients, vitamins, and minerals that are essential for maintaining good health. It also helps to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. In contrast, consuming too much meat has been linked to an increased risk of these diseases.  Secondly, reducing meat consumption is crucial for the environment. The production of meat requires a large amount of resources such as water, land, and energy. It also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a major contributor to climate change. By reducing meat consumption, we can help to conserve these resources and reduce our carbon footprint.  Moreover, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can also help to reduce animal cruelty. The meat industry often involves inhumane treatment of animals, such as overcrowding, confinement, and cruel slaughtering practices. By reducing meat consumption, we can help to reduce the demand for these practices and promote more humane treatment of animals.  In conclusion, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is beneficial for our health, the environment, and animal welfare. While it may be challenging to make the switch at first, there are many delicious and nutritious plant-based alternatives available. By reducing meat consumption, we can make a positive impact on our own lives and the world around us.		1
unsure about their career path?  As an 8th-grade student, I believe that most common societies expect students to identify a career by the time they reach their late teens or early twenties. However, I think that the best age to start figuring out a career path is actually much earlier.  One of the main difficulties that young people face when trying to determine what they want for life is the lack of experience and knowledge about different career paths. Many students are not exposed to a wide range of career options until they are in college or even later in life, which can make it difficult for them to make an informed decision about their future. Additionally, the pressure to choose a career can be overwhelming, and students may feel like they have to settle for something that they are not truly passionate about.  In the article "The Four-Year Career Decision," the author discusses their own experience of being given four years to decide on a career. They describe feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do, and ultimately deciding to pursue a career in writing. While the author acknowledges that this decision was ultimately a good one, they also note that the pressure to make a decision so early on can be stressful and difficult.  To young people who are unsure about their career path, the author gives the advice to take the time to explore different options and to seek out guidance and advice from mentors and professionals in their desired field. They also encourage students to be open to new experiences and to be willing to take risks and try new things. Ultimately, the author believes that finding the right career path is a process that takes time and effort, and that students should not feel rushed or pressured to make a decision too early on.		1
 Facial action coding system is a method used to analyze human behavior and interpret non-verbal communication. It is a tool used in research studies to determine the emotions, thoughts, and reactions of people based on the movements of their faces.  There are many different methods for analyzing facial expressions and behaviors, but one of the most popular is the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). This is a standardized method for encoding facial expressions into numerical values, which can be used for research and analysis.  There are six basic facial action units (FACUs) that can be used to analyze facial expressions:  1. Raising eyebrows 2. Opening the eyes up to their full extent 3. Smiling 4. Closing the eyelids all the way 5. Opening the mouth and lifting the lips up 6. Frowning and pursing the lips together  Using these FACUs, facial expressions can be coded into numerical values that can be used for analysis. For example, raising eyebrows would be coded as 1, opening the eyes all the way would be coded as 2, smiling would be coded as 3, and so on.  FACS has been used in a wide variety of research studies, from studying the effects of medication on facial expressions to determining the accuracy of lie detection tests. It is a powerful tool for analyzing non-verbal communication and gaining insights into human behavior.  One of the benefits of using FACS is its standardization. Because the FACS method uses a standard set of FACUs, it allows for accurate and consistent coding of facial expressions, which can be valuable for research studies that involve multiple participants.  In addition, FACS can be used to analyze facial expressions in real-time, which can be useful for studying live interactions between people. This can be particularly useful for research studies that involve conversations or interviews, where subtle non-verbal cues can be important for understanding the dynamics of the interaction.  Overall, the Facial Action Coding System is a powerful tool for analyzing human behavior and gaining insights into non-verbal communication. Its standardization, flexibility, and real-time analysis make it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners alike.		1
 In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. People who start a career can make it happen. Students who took it early can ask their counselor for advice. Many students believe that starting a career at a young age is a good idea because students can go to college after their courses, students can get a job after college, and students don't have to worry about making one in the future. However, starting a career at a young age is a bad idea because it can cause students to quit their courses, it can cause lots of thinking to make one, and it can cause waste of time.  Students will quit their courses. For instance, when ever they went to class and took it for three weeks, they will usually give up. Furthermore, it can cause people to lose interest about their career. Teens who quit their courses, they have a hard time because it was difficult for them to keep up. Therefore, it is important to think first before taking that class.  It can cause lots of thinking to make one. For example, it takes time for adults to make their career. In addition, they will mostly think about getting a job first. Adults will usually think about getting a job because they want to earn money first. Not only that, adults like to spend time with their friends, but they make their career after they get paid enough to start their life.  It can cause waste of time. In fact, kids will spend time playing video games than making a career. Moreover, they think that career is school related. When making a career, kids will often write "don't know" and they will usually get back to their hobby. Thus, it is essential to make a plan first before making a career at a young age.  Making a career at age of twelve or under is careless because it made people over think, it made them go back doing something, and it can cause them negative towards their courses. When ever they took their class about two ore three weeks, they usually will give up. Kids will often write "don't know" on their career paper. Making a career will take time for people to make, but don't give up easily if they can't pace up. It is important to understand that starting a career at a young age can have a significant impact on a person's life, and it is essential		1
Hey there!  So, I reckon working in a group and working alone are like two different worlds, ya know? Both have their own benefits and challenges, and it's pretty cool to think about how they can complement each other.  Working in a group is like, super helpful when you're trying to get something done. You can all share ideas and brainstorm together, and before you know it, you've got a pretty sweet project or presentation. Plus, it's way easier to divide tasks and work on 'em when you're part of a team. For instance, if you're working on a group project for school, you can assign tasks to different people based on their strengths and weaknesses. It's like, a win-win situation!  But, working alone can also be pretty cool. Like, when you're working on a creative project, it's way easier to get into that zone when you're by yourself. You can just focus on your ideas and bring 'em to life without worrying about what anyone else thinks. Plus, you can work at your own pace, which can be super helpful if you're someone who likes to take their time and make sure things are just right. For example, if you're writing a story or drawing a comic, it's way easier to get into the zone when you're alone.  One example of how working in a group adds value is when we did that science fair project last year. We were supposed to research a topic and create a display board, and we decided to do it as a group. It was way easier to brainstorm ideas and come up with a plan when we were all together, and we could bounce ideas off each other. Plus, we could divide the workload and make sure everything got done on time. If we had tried to do it alone, it would've taken way longer and we probably wouldn't have done as good of a job.  But, working alone can also cause challenges. Like, if you're working on a project and you don't have anyone to bounce ideas off of, it can be hard to come up with new ideas. You might get stuck in a rut and not know how to move forward. And, if you're working		1
With the technology that we are capable of using to create a spaceship to have astronomers study Venus from a distance and gather information is a massive jump leading to a future where more than likely NASA could get a better understanding on our sister planet.  With deeper knowledge of a planet so similar to earth, it could really boost us and lead to bigger andvancements such as creating rovers or spaceships that can sustain Venus' enviorment for more than just a couple of weeks. With an ability to have rovers or spaceships that can sustain the enviorment, NASA can get a better understanding and get more evidance so that deeper, and more complex studies on Venus can be taken part in. With an advancement in technology in spacecrafts, scientists can achieve better understanding of the planet and its atmospere, Scientist can get more complex answers and evidance on the age of the planet, and its atmospheric pressure. Due to so little data or lack of technology to get more advanced studies of the planet, it has been difficult to get more answers than what we already have.  In conclusion, although the trips to study gather information on our sister planet, Venus, more information and evidance on the planet could let sicentists find a find a way to maybe inhabit Venus or if not, just get deeper knowledge on it.   		0
Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. With the rise of technology, students now have the ability to attend classes online from the comfort of their own homes. While there are certainly advantages to this form of education, there are also some disadvantages that must be considered. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the benefits of attending classes online versus physically going to school.  One of the biggest advantages of distance learning is the flexibility it offers. Students can attend classes from anywhere, as long as they have a reliable internet connection. This means that they can attend classes while working or traveling, or even while living in a different country. For example, a student who is studying abroad can still attend classes online and keep up with their studies, even if they cannot physically attend classes on campus.  Another advantage of distance learning is the ability to learn at one's own pace. In traditional classroom settings, students are often forced to move on to the next topic before they have fully understood it. With online classes, however, students can take as much time as they need to review and understand the material. This is especially helpful for students who struggle with certain concepts or who need extra practice.  Despite these advantages, there are also some disadvantages to attending classes online. One of the biggest disadvantages is the lack of social interaction. In traditional classroom settings, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers on a face-to-face basis. This can be especially important for developing social skills and building relationships with others. Without this interaction, students may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers.  Another disadvantage of distance learning is the potential for distractions. When students are attending classes online, they need to have a lot of self-discipline to avoid getting distracted by social media or other online activities. This can be difficult for some students, and they may not be as successful in their studies as they would be in a traditional classroom setting.  In conclusion, there are certainly advantages and disadvantages to attending classes online versus physically going to school. While distance learning offers flexibility and the ability to learn at one's own pace, it can also be isolating and distracting. Ultimately, the best form of education will depend on the individual student's needs and preferences.		1
Dear Principle,  I am writing you this letter to inform you on my opinion and advice on community service. I know it seems bizarre for someone on your power to listen to a student. I just want to inform you on what community service helps with and what is it.  Community service allows many people, not only students, to help their community by picking up litter at parks and other public places. Also by, helping the elderly, tutoring children at their elementary schools and much more in that sort. Sometimes students and some adults might find it time consuming and just as a waste of time, but i think it is best for us and others in the community.  Some of my friends help around the community by picking up litter and tutoring children as I told you above. They say they have fun with it because they do it as a group. I was thinking that maybe you should consider having groups of students participate in community service as credits to pass school, which would make it mandatory. From my experiences in doing community service, I can honestly tell you that once you have accomplished it, it makes you feel great about yourself knowing that you have helped others around you and in your community.  I hope you take this letter into consideration and that you think about making it a "have to" activity. I am pretty sure students will enjoy doing community service if they do it with a group of friends they like being with. Thank you and please get back to me.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
 Venus, also known as the second planet from the Sun, has long been a mysterious and fascinating object for scientists and space enthusiasts alike. With its thick atmosphere, sweltering temperatures, and fast-spinning rotation, Venus presents numerous challenges to those seeking to explore it.  One of the main challenges in exploring Venus is its scorching surface temperatures. As the planet's atmosphere traps heat and helps to create a greenhouse effect, surface temperatures on Venus can reach up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. This makes it extremely difficult for human spacecraft or rovers to operate on the planet's surface.  Another challenge faced by explorers trying to study Venus is its dense and toxic atmosphere. Venus' atmosphere is composed primarily of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide droplets blocking out much of the sunlight that would otherwise illuminate the planet's surface. This creates a hostile and unforgiving environment that is difficult for scientists to study or explore.  Despite these challenges, there have been some remarkable successes in exploring Venus thus far. For example, in 1976, the Soviet Venera 9 landed on Venus and sent back the first clear images of the planet's surface. More recently, in 2010, NASA's Magellan spacecraft began circling Venus for the second time, creating a detailed map of the planet's surface and providing important insights into its geology and climate.  As we continue to explore Venus, there remain many mysteries to uncover and questions to answer. Is there life on Venus? What are the planet's geological and climate processes like? And how do Venus' extreme conditions impact its overall atmosphere and climate? With advances in technology and our understanding of the universe, these questions are becoming increasingly possible to answer.  In conclusion, Venus presents many challenges to space enthusiasts seeking to explore it. Its scorching temperatures and toxic atmosphere make it one of the most difficult planets to study and explore. However, despite these challenges, there have been remarkable successes in exploring Venus, and we continue to learn more about this fascinating planet with each new mission. As our knowledge of the universe grows, so too does our understanding of Venus and its place in it.		1
Do you believe that students should have to do an extracurricular activity? No, I my self don't think that students have to do after school activities. Many schools now are making students do extracurricular school activities that kids don't want to do. If this activity doesn't teach them to know how to pay bills or read and write, I don't think it needs to be required. Students should¬†not have to do an extracurricular activity because it could stress them out, not all kids have a ride back home, and kids need to relax and be kids.  After school activities can stress students out. On top of everything they have homework, chores, and other family events to do. Kids shouldn't have to worry about something if doesn't benefit them in the future. The have lives to live and can't stress over something that might not be that important.  Parents and relatives shouldn't have to worry either.  Not all kids have a ride back home. Parents have to go to work they just can't take off when ever they want. Yes I know people have other relatives but they also have lives to live. Everyone can't fix their lives around the school system. That is not how life works and not how it should go.  Students and kids need to relax and enjoy being young. They can't be up and going all day long, its just to much. This is a regular students daily routine, go to school for seven hours, then go home and do at least two hours worth of homework. Then get to relax, if you were to add an extracurricular activity in the mix of all that no one would ever get a break. They can't handle all of what they have to do all ready, and adding on something else would be to much.  I have learned a lot from this and students have way to much on their plate. If kids don't need to do an extracurricular activity then they shouldn't have to. We as a community, state, and country need to make sure that school systems don't make kids do something that they don't want to do. No student should ever have to do an extracurricular activity because it can stress them out, wouldn't have a ride all the time, they just need to relax sometimes. Do you still agree that students should have to do an after school extracurricular activity?¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†		0
High school graduation is a significant milestone for students, marking the end of their formal education and the beginning of a new chapter in their lives. While some students may choose to graduate in three years, others may opt for four years. The decision to graduate early or on time is influenced by various factors, including academic performance, extracurricular activities, and personal preferences.  One of the primary benefits of graduating high school early is that it allows students to save time and money. By completing their studies in three years, students can enter college earlier and potentially save a year of tuition and fees. Additionally, graduating early can provide students with a sense of accomplishment and a head start on their future goals.  However, there are also drawbacks to graduating early. Some students may feel rushed or pressured to graduate early, which can lead to lower grades or a lack of focus on important coursework. Additionally, graduating early may limit opportunities for extracurricular activities or internships, which can be valuable for building skills and gaining work experience.  Summer classes are another topic of debate among high school students. Some students may choose to take classes during the summer to catch up on coursework or get ahead, while others may prefer to take a break from formal education and pursue other interests.  There are several benefits to taking summer classes, including the ability to catch up on coursework or get ahead, the flexibility to schedule classes around personal schedules, and the opportunity to take courses that may not be offered during the regular school year. However, there are also drawbacks to taking summer classes, including the potential for burnout or fatigue, the added expense of tuition and fees, and the potential for a lack of social interaction with peers.  Elective courses are an important part of high school education, providing students with the opportunity to explore their interests and develop new skills. Some popular elective courses include art, music, drama, and technology. These courses can be beneficial for students in a variety of ways, including improving creativity, developing critical thinking skills, and enhancing communication and collaboration skills.  Finally, the decision to work and save money for college is influenced by a variety of factors, including financial need, personal preferences, and career goals. Some students may choose to work part-time or full-time while in high school to save money for college, while others may		1
The electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a comprimise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Should we keep the electoral college or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.  In my opinion I think we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think we should change because under the electoral college, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elects the president. for example, if you lived in Texas and you wanted to vote for John Kerry you would vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. If those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and get 34 electoral votes. The electors can be anyone not holding office. Voters cannot control whom thier electors vote for.  The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system in each state. Candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the races in the swing states. The elctoral college is widely regared as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner.  The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. Abolish the elactoral college. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.    		0
 The electoral college has been a part of the United States' democratic system since its inception, but the question of whether it works or not has been a longstanding debate. Proponents argue that it represents the will of the people, while opponents argue that it is an outdated system that no longer serves the country's needs. In this essay, we will explore both sides of the argument and examine whether the electoral college works effectively in choosing the President of the United States.  One of the main reasons why proponents argue that the electoral college works is because it allows the will of the people to be heard. The electoral college gives each state a certain number of electoral votes based on its population, meaning that larger states have more influence in the election process than smaller states. This ensures that the President is chosen by the entire country, not just by individuals living in urban areas or states with large populations. Additionally, the electoral college gives the same amount of influence to each state, regardless of whether it is a swing state or not. This means that states with historically blue or red leanings are not disproportionately represented, as they would be in a system based solely on population.  On the other hand, opponents argue that the electoral college is an outdated system that no longer serves the country's needs. They point out that technology and demographic changes have drastically altered the way people do business, and that the electoral college system is no exception. In today's world, where people are more connected and informed than ever before, it is no longer realistic to have an election based on the whims of a small group of political insiders. Instead, it is time to move towards a more straightforward and transparent system, such as a popular vote.  Finally, there is also the argument that the electoral college leads to the candidate ignoring certain states if they believe they have the election in the bag, known as "safe states." This has led to the phenomenon of campaigns being more focused on swing states rather than on the needs of the entire country. In contrast, a popular vote system would require candidates to appeal to a wider range of voters, ensuring that they address the concerns of all citizens, not just those in key swing states.  Despite these arguments, however, the electoral college remains a popular system in America. It has been successful in choosing Presidents who have gone on to achieve great things, and it continues to be a part of the country's democratic machinery. Supporters argue that		1
  Dear [State Senator],  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system and its relevance in the presidential election process. As an informed citizen, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic system and should be retained.  One of the primary arguments in favor of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure a decisive outcome in the presidential election. Unlike popular vote systems, where a candidate can win an election with a plurality of votes, the Electoral College requires a candidate to receive a majority of votes to win the presidency. This ensures that the winner of the election has broad support across the country, rather than simply relying on a few heavily populated areas. As Bradford Plumer notes in his article "The Indefensible Electoral College," the Electoral College "forces candidates to campaign in a wide range of states, rather than just focusing on heavily Democratic or Republican areas" (Plumer). This leads to a more inclusive and representative election process.  Another advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to prevent a tie in the election. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out in his article "In Defense of the Electoral College," the Electoral College ensures that the president is elected through a process that is less susceptible to a tie or a disputed outcome. This is particularly important in a democratic system, where the peaceful transfer of power is crucial. Posner argues that a popular vote system would lead to a "swing states" phenomenon, where candidates focus their efforts on a select few states and neglect the rest. This would result in a less representative election process and lead to a greater likelihood of a disputed outcome.  Critics of the Electoral College argue that it is undemocratic and unf		1
 The electoral college is a fundamental aspect of the US political system that determines who will become the President of the United States. The system was established by the framers of the Constitution as a compromise between selection by Congress and selection by a popular vote. However, the electoral college has been the subject of much debate and criticism in recent years, and it is common to hear arguments that it does not work as intended. In this essay, we will examine the strengths and weaknesses of the electoral college and whether it still serves as an effective method for choosing a president.  One of the main strengths of the electoral college system is that it ensures that every vote counts, regardless of the size of the population in a particular state. This is because, under the electoral college system, each state is allocated a number of electoral votes equal to the number of Senators and Representatives it has in Congress. This means that smaller states can still have a significant influence on the outcome of an election, even if they have a relatively small population.  Another strength of the electoral college is that it encourages candidates to campaign in every state, not just in major population centers. This is because every vote in every state counts, and candidates can lose an election even if they win the majority of the popular vote nationwide. This ensures that candidates are in touch with the concerns and priorities of voters in all states, not just those in the big cities and states that are more likely to vote for them.  However, there are also some weaknesses to the electoral college system that suggest it may not be as effective as it could be. One of the main criticisms is that it allows a candidate to win the presidency even if they do not have the support of the majority of Americans. This is because the president can be elected by winning the electoral college votes of a few key swing states, even if they are not particularly representative of the nation as a whole. This means that a candidate can win the presidency by appealing primarily to the interests of the key swing states, rather than the broader American public.  Another strength of the electoral college is that it encourages candidates to appeal to a wide range of voters, rather than just to those in their own party or their base of support. This is because candidates who win elections must appeal to voters in swing states, which often have more diverse political leanings. However, this also means that candidates may be less likely to appeal to the interests of the most fervent supporters of their party, as a compromise may be necessary to win over swing voters.  In conclusion, the electoral college system is not perfect, but it does have some important strengths as well as weaknesses. While it ensures that every vote counts and encourages candidates to campaign across the nation, it also allows candidates to win the presidency by appealing primarily to a narrow group of voters, rather than the broader American public. Ultimately, the question of whether the electoral college works will depend on whether it is seen as a fair and just system for choosing a president, or as a flawed and unfair method that fails to represent the will of the people.		1
I don't think it would benefit students to attend classes from home by online such as video conference Why? because they would get distracted by anything else at home and also they wouldn't have the chance to experience what it would be like in school.  If they attend school from home how would they get things done at home? they have the chance to do something else other then school work because they are going on their time. They also are not supervised with teacher like they would at school. They could easily get answers when it comes to tests and quizzes so where would the challenge be when you could just do that. When you are at school you are supervised so there is no looking up answer,you actually have to study to accomplish things. You could easily get distracted by things at home even say I dont want to do it anymore and I feel like thats the risk it would take if¬†students are allowed¬†to take classes at home online.  Students also would miss the chance to experience what it would be like in school. The chance to meet new people, make friends,and just simple socialize with other peers. It would also help students¬†for the real world because when you work you can't do it from home on a computer. You actually have to show up to work and work with others. You also miss the chance to do other things that you would in school that you can't at home like join a club or play a sport and actually do so much that you can't at home. Have that motivation to wake up and go to school and challenge your self and prepare yourself for the world. When you are at home,wouldn't you get board being home all day instead of being at school and just enjoying it. Yes it's a struggle waking up early in the morning to go to school but also it's boring staying home and missing all the things you can do and learn at school with friends and teachers.  I understand why some students would consider taking classes from home maybe they have a personally reason or they can't keep up and rather take their time at home but for that reason you would have to do your best and not get distracted. Being home may help them do¬†better then at school I understand but I think you miss a lot and all the experience¬†that you could get at school. I personally don't think it would benefit missing all that and knowing how it would be. When you get a job that you dont have the option to do it home in the computer so how would you learn and know what it's like.  Therefor I don't think students would benefit from attending classes at home by online or video conferencing. Student should attend school and experience¬†it all not be home distracted and miss many chances to learn new things and socialize with peers. Maybe even discover what they are good and¬†take that for their future.   ¬† ¬†¬†¬†		0
In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile", explains how technology created by Prof. Thomas Huang and his colliague Prof. Nicu Sebe have been devolping better ways for humans and coputer to communicate. Almost all people can read someone's emotion through the expression they give even through a fake smile, and some over look this. Say it's chritmas and your parents get you a bag of grape fruits, you probably are going to be unsatisfied or annoyed, angry even. If it was from your parents though your going to put on a show and smile and and probably say things like "wow, this is awesome". Faking an expression like this will most definently fool your parents, but with this new technology you would simply be able to know how you child is feeling.  The question is though whether or not the use of this technology would be useful in students classrooms be valuanle. To some teachers it might affect them to the fact students keep falling asleep or not doing homework, and maybe just maybe with this technology you would be able to change your teaching style to create a more fun, interesting time in class. Honestly though It doesn't need to be used in classes. Why would you need to use it in the classroom. People have different emotions everyday, heck every second. Why would you need a device that reads emothions for school. This technology would be much better used in a game or a useful tool for phsycologist. There is no reason for it. If you had it would you use it to change the way a student is feeling probably not. Just cause there is technology that can determine somene's emotion doesn't mean it can change the way that person is feeling. Sometimes people need to fake the truth anyways.		0
Introduction Sports are an integral part of many school communities, providing opportunities for students to stay active, socialize, and develop important life skills. However, some schools have implemented policies that require students to maintain a certain grade average in order to participate in sports. This essay will explore the benefits and drawbacks of these requirements, drawing on research from various sources.  Benefits One of the main benefits of requiring students to maintain a certain grade average in order to participate in sports is that it encourages academic excellence. By linking academic performance with participation in sports, schools can send a clear message to students that success in both areas is important. This can motivate students to work harder in the classroom, leading to better grades and a stronger academic foundation.  Another benefit of these policies is that they can help to promote a culture of excellence within the school community. When students see their peers excelling in both academics and sports, they may be inspired to strive for excellence in their own lives. This can lead to a more positive and motivated school environment, where students are more likely to achieve their full potential.  Drawbacks However, there are also potential drawbacks to these policies. One major concern is that they can create pressure on students to prioritize academics over sports, potentially leading to burnout and a lack of balance in their lives. This can be especially problematic for students who are already struggling academically, as the added pressure of maintaining a certain grade average could lead to even greater stress and anxiety.  Another potential drawback is that these policies can be unfair to students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. For example, students who are struggling with poverty or other external factors may not have the same resources or support as their peers, making it more difficult for them to maintain a certain grade average. This can lead to a situation where only students from more affluent backgrounds are able to participate in sports, creating a further divide within the school community.  Conclusion In conclusion, the policies that require students to maintain a certain grade average in order to participate in sports have both benefits and drawbacks. While they can encourage academic excellence and promote a culture of excellence within the school community, they can also create pressure on students and be unfair to those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Ultimately, the decision to implement these policies should be carefully considered, taking into account the		1
Limiting the usage of cars has a variety of advantages. From having a less expensive life, to less air pollution, and overall a generally happier life. Thinking about all the excess and stress that comes with owning a car is tiring. Not to mention the hazardous effect it had on our lives. Would it not be nice to just take off some of that burden off of you, and be a happier person?.Let me help you out on how to achieve that.  Owning a car is pricey! In Freiburg along with paying for your house you also have to pay for a parking garage, which comes with a hefty price. Did i not mention the distance you have to walk to park? lets just say you might as well have taken the bus."Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development,where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home."source one,section two. With you alone driving to work and back everyday will tally up to over a hundred dollars spent every week, now add children into it, and their after school activities, also add emergencies. See where this is going? sure you might need a car now and then, having a car is not a bad thing. How about Carpooling? It will reduce that price you have on your gas recipts and create more time for bonding and interacting with people.  Health or driving? Well if you are not healthy you can not drive can you? With all of the automobiles we have today it is bound to affect the earth. The smog in the air leading to that first cough that can lead to something more terminal. Imagine what it would be like if you had less cars, or even no cars at all! well the capital of France tried it and the results were amazing."Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog.."source two,section fourteen. Now think about if that ban that Paris enforced,was tried out in other countries. Just that little change in the amount of cars on the road let to that difference of the pollution. Probably led to a difference in someones health too.  Everything stated above leads to happiness, from the less expenses that will have to be paid, and the less damage that the pollution will have on your health. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," said Heidrun Walter"source one, section three.Also when there are less cars on the road your community will be able to connect more and have better infranstructure, which would make them happy just like it did for the people of Bogata, Columbia."Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalksrushhour restrictions have dramatically cut trafficand new resturants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up."source three,section twentyeight.  Overall the advantages of limiting car usage has many benefits to it. From having a less expensive life, by not having to pay for gas so often, car insurance, and evrything else that comes with it. Having better health also is a advantage of the limitation of car usage. Also one of the most important aspects of life, happiness comes with the limitation of using cars. So there is no reason to not try it out, there will be more benefits.		0
I think policy one is better, standing on my own opinion if you have a phone at school and say a fire starts or someone is holding up the school and school phones are down, a student that has a phone can use it to call 911, family, friends, etc.  Even though I think Policy 1 is better I think turning your phones off in class isn't completely right either, say a student needs to call a parent to bring work in. Someone could easily argue that there is a school phone to use in the situation, yes that person would be right but what if the number is out of the area? Then again someone could argue that there is the principle phone to use that can call that number, what if the principle is busy with two students fighting and or not a work?  Now Policy 2 does have some justice to it, some say it is a distraction from learning. I say only if the teachers make it a distraction from learning by pointing out a student and pausing the class to handle a student with a cell phone. If a student chooses not to learn then that is the student's choice. Those terms could be used badly but a student does have a choice, having a phone can be bad. But I think there are plenty of justice and injustice on having a phone at school.  Till someone makes a final decision then we will just keep debating on this subject. But I would have to say Policy 1 is better for the school, parents, and students. But there are more rules that could be applied to Policy 1 to help make Policy 1 and Policy 2 be combined and made into a better rule/policy.		0
 The electoral college is a group of electors that is responsible for choosing the President and Vice-President of the United States. It has been in place since the founding of the country and has been the source of much debate and discussion over the years. The question of whether the electoral college works is a complex one, but in this essay, I will argue that it does not currently work as it should and needs to be reformed.  First, let us take a look at how the electoral college works. The President is elected by a group of electors who are chosen by each state's political parties. Each state gets a number of electors equal to the number of Senators and Representatives in Congress. Whichever candidate gets the most electoral votes becomes the President. The Vice-President is chosen by the losing candidate.  The problem with this system is that it can often lead to the candidate ignoring certain states, particularly smaller ones, in favor of larger states where they can gain more votes. This is known as "safely blue" or "safely red" states, where a candidate's victory is almost guaranteed. This can lead to a lack of campaigning and voter engagement in certain areas, as candidates see little point in investing time and resources in states that they are likely to win or lose.  Another issue with the electoral college is the influence that the swing states can have on the election. These are the states that are up for grabs and can often make or break a candidate's chance of winning the presidency. In order to win the presidency, a candidate must win at least 270 electoral votes. This means that they need to win at least three swing states, in addition to winning states where they are expected to win. This can lead to candidates focusing on these swing states and ignoring others, again leading to a lack of campaigning and voter engagement in certain areas.  Furthermore, the electoral college can also lead to the candidate with the most popular vote nationwide not winning the presidency. This can occur when a candidate wins the popular vote in all states except for one or a few, where they lose enough electoral votes to defeat the other candidate. This system can lead to a candidate's winning the popular vote being overridden by the electoral college's decision, which can erode public confidence in the democratic process and undermine the legitimacy of the winning candidate.  Finally, the electoral college can also perpetuate the issue of voter disenfranchisement. When certain groups of voters, such as low-income or marginalized communities, do not have equal representation in the electoral college, their voices are not being heard and their concerns are not being addressed. This can lead to a lack of representation in government and perpetuate the cycle of voter disenfranchisement.  In conclusion, the electoral college, as it currently exists, does not work as it should. It can lead to a lack of campaigning, voter disenfranchisement, and the candidate's winning the popular vote not being reflected in the election results. In order to truly represent the will of the people and ensure that the President is chosen fairly and democratically, the electoral college needs to be reformed. There are several options for reform, such as abolition or eliminating the electoral college entirely, but it is clear that the current system is not working, and change is necessary.		1
Dear Senator, I, STUDENT_NAME, am in favor of changing our democracy to popular vote. Electoral college does no good to our society. It's out of date, it's irrational, everybody in this case has a great chance of becoming president. That is no good, we do not need idiots running our country. Election by popular vote is the best way to go. You will have a certain outcome and votes will be fairly made. It benefits everybody. More than half of our population wants you guys to make the switch.  The electoral college is not an up to date voting method. Our founding fathers made it many years ago while writing the constitution. It is a long process of nonsense that has no advantages to us, the people. By popular vote, it's faster, simpler, and better. Popular vote is basically a group of qualified citizens voting for the president. Popular vote is the best way for people to directly voice their opinions by picking the president of their choice. If we use the Electoral college, the electors of our state may not deliever it properly.  Over 60 percent of voters prefer direct elections. Government officials such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and others all thought we should abolish the electoral college. Many things are wrong with the electoral college, we don't directly vote for the president but for the slate of electors, who eventually vote for the president. It in no way benefits the people, they have no control over who the electors pick. In many cases, people have decided to not even vote because there was no hope.  If there are greater chances of everybody being president, not only is there a fool running the country,he isn't going to worry about your interests or needs. If your own president won't help your interests, potential voters may be turned off. Isn't that horrible, to feel that our president isn't our president? Knowing that our vote will have less of an elect, we won't want to vote. Voters in presidential elections are people who have something to say and actually want to express themselves. They are not the people who don't care and just vote to vote.  You and the rest of the senate should consider this very deeply. It isn't just benefiting the people, but congress, the whole senate and most importantly, the president. It will make us a better nation and one as a whole. I hope you take this into great consideration and make the change. The only way to get back the peoples trust and votes is by taking baby steps. This is one great step and good things may come out of this.		0
Texting and Driving is Dangerous  Many people use cellphones on a daily basis while driving a car. This is a common practice for some teenagers and is a form of distracted driving known as "Texting and Driving." In many states it is illegal to text and drive. There have been laws adopted in many states to prevent people from texting and driving while in a vehicle. Even though people do it, drivers should not be able to use cellphones in any compacity while operating a vehicle because it takes their eyes away from the road. The use of a cellphone while driving is very dangerous, careless, and cause crashes that hurt and kill people.  Additionally, when driving a car, the driver should be alert and paying attention to their surroundings. The driver should not be dialing, sending a text, or reading Facebook because it stops the driver's concentration from the road. Texting while driving is the cause of more than 58% of crashes involving teen drivers. Life is more important than "I'm close or an OMG" text! It takes five seconds to send a text and five seconds to be the cause of a crash, that can hurt or endanger the lives of other people. The National Safety Council reports that cellphone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year and nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting and driving. One out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.  Furthermore, in Georgia, laws have been made prohibiting the use of cellphones while driving a vehicle. It is illegal to hold a cellphone in your hand or on any part of your body and if violators get caught, you will have to pay a large fine. The law should be enough to stop people from driving and using their cellphones, but it's not. On the news, in Cobb County, the police dresses up as utility workers at various intersections to catch violators using their phones and most of the time they catch a lot of drivers and give out traffic citations.  In conclusion, no one should be on their phone while driving because it is a risk to them and other drivers on the road. Cellphones are a wonderful invention and one of the greatest inventions made by man, but texting while driving is very dangerous and can cause death to other drivers. This can also result into being convicted of murder and life in prison.  References 1. Hafner, Josh. "Drop That Phone: It's Now Illegal to Hold Your Mobile Device While Driving in Georgia."

Hey, ya gotta check this out! ü§ì  So, like, Ralph Waldo Emerson was this super smart dude who lived a long time ago, and he said that being yourself in a world that's always trying to change you is like, the coolest thing ever! üí™ And I gotta say, I totally agree with him! ü§©  First of all, it's like, super hard to be someone you're not. I mean, have you ever tried to be like, pretend to be into something you're not? üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄ ?It's exhausting, right?! You gotta keep up the act all the time, and it's just not worth it. But when you're being yourself, you don't have to worry about anything! üòå  And it's not just that it's hard, it's also really important to be yourself. Like, think about it, if everyone was the same, the world would be so boring! üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇ ?We'd all be just like robots or something! But when people are themselves, it's like, so much more interesting! üí• You get to see all these different perspectives and personalities, and it's just awesome!  And let's not forget about the pressure to be something else! üò© Like, there are so many people who are trying to be someone they're not, just to fit in or impress others. But honestly, who cares what other people think?! üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄ ?It's way more important to be happy with who you are, than to try to be someone else just to impress others.  So yeah, I definitely agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson. Being yourself in a world that's always trying to change you is the greatest accomplishment! üíØ It's like, the ultimate badge of honor! üèÜ And I'm gonna keep being myself, no matter what anyone else says! üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ?  That's it for now, gotta go, but I hope you liked my essay!		1
I think that driverless cars is something that can potentially make driving a little more safe. Driverless cars are not completely driverless though because they alert the driver when they are needed to take over. Sensors used in cars are also beneficial because they can give information that can cause the car to apply brakes and reduce power from the engine. Therefore, it allows for a better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.  Even though driverless cars can do some things on their own, the human driver must still remain alert and be ready to take over when necessary. For this reason, it is necessary for the car to be ready to notify the driver when a problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object, and the Google car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. These are both ways that can alert a driver when it is time for them to drive, which can help people to be ready to focus while driving.  In conclusion, driverless cars can be beneficial to us and help drivers while they are driving. The drivers of these cars must also be alert as well too. There are sensors and other developments that can help with this process and notify drivers when it is time for them to take control. Everything will not happen right away because it is a process that will take time to be sought through and manufactured correctly. So in the future, maybe we will see more driverless cars then than now and it will be a beneficial way to the driving in our country.   		0
When it comes tocharting a successful path in life, having a positive attitude is one of the most important tools you can possess. Research has shown that the power of positivity can help propel a person towards their goals and allow them to lead a happier and more meaningful life. Having a positive outlook not only helps increase motivation, but it can also help us to handle difficult situations more effectively and look for solutions rather than dwell on the negatives. On the other hand, not having a positive attitude can cause us to doubt ourselves, become discouraged more easily, and limit our capacity to see solutions.   Therefore, it is important to recognize the indicators of a negative attitude, such as feeling discouraged or pessimistic, and develop strategies to reverse it. Examples of how a positive attitude can be beneficial in difficult situations include learning how to stay calm, looking for opportunities in adversity, and using positive language. Additionally, in order to achieve goals, it is important to focus on the overall goal rather than on small failures along the way, and to maintain a mindset that is open to learning and is driven by enthusiasm.  With a positive attitude and continued dedication, many seemingly impossible goals can be achieved.		1
Have you ever imagined a world without drivers? Google cofounder Sergey Brin has envisioned public transportation systems that are driverless. Driverless vehicles is a bad idea because of, safety, more money being wasted in production, and driving itself.  First of all, the saftey of a driver is in danger when a computer takes over. At any given moment, the car can fail, and the driver can get injured. The text states, "The human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires." In the 21st century, we have cell phone. If a people already today use their phones while driving, imagine when driverless cars are introduced to the public. People will be paying more attention to their cell phones that the road.  Secondly, making these car will take a large amount of money. The text say that a Toyota Prius was modified with numerous cameras and sensors to make this driverless car mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. Buying a car made with all those modifications will cost you. Also, adding more systems in the car such as, entertainment and information systems, will cost money too.  Driving was always fun to everybody, but with the idea of a driverless car, the fun goes away. "The phsychological aspects of automation are really a challenge." To fix the problem, BMW project manager says that they have to interpret the driving in a new fun way. BMW says they will add entertainments systems. That is a dumb idea because you need to be paying attention to the road.  Driverless cars, will become worse thorughout the course of its production. There will be failures within the car itself and the technology inside it. There will also be more problems to worry about, such as the systems breaking and the car breaking down. Do you really want to sit and watch a computer drive you to your destination? 		0
Ever since their creation, cars have been the main method of transportation. However, in recent times cars have become less popular because of the issues that they cause. Limited car use would be very advantageous because vehicles discourage physical activity, make pollution, and cost everyone money.  An advantage of limiting the use of cars is that they discourage physical activity. Reliance on a motorized vehicle for transportation from place to place results in little to no physical activity. Cars have replaced the use of bicycles, skateboards, and regular walking, their use seemingly reserved only for the youth. In a car free society such as Vaunban, Germany, the "swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children" can be heard by anyone walking down the street Source 1. This clearly shows that when cars are used less, people engage in more physical activity. This is the same case for Bogota, Columbia where the Day Without Cars is a big hit. Just in the third year of this event, over 118 miles of bicycle paths have been constructed in the city Source 3. Limiting the use of cars is definetely advantageous because they discourage physical activity.  Limiting the use of cars would be incredibly beneficial because they make pollution. The billions of vehicles in the world create unbelievable amounts of pollution. In Europe, "passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions" and "up to 50 percent... in the United States" Source 1. The pollution from the increasing amounts of cars in compacted areas "are chocking cities" Source 1. Nearly nothing else creates that much pollution. The only thing that cars are second to in the pollution rates are the monstrous power plants that continuously belch smoke into the atmosphere Source 4. If the use of vehicles decreases, then "it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment" Source 4. This evidence clearly supports that the use of vehicles is causing a huge amount of pollution. Thus, limiting the use of cars would be incredibly beneficial because they make pollution.  Decreased use of automobiles would be extremely advantageous because the they cost everyone money. Expenses such as constant maintanance and fuel cost the average car owner a large chunk of their salary. In April 2013, the average miles driven per person was down by 9 percent, equivalent to the rate in January 1995 Source 4. The most likely cause is that "cashstrapped Americans could not afford new cars" Source 4. The high cost of cars and their maintanace is a huge burden on the backs of the average vehicle owner. Not only does vehicles cost the individual person, but they have large effects on the government. In the sixyear federal transportation bill, the cost of the highways was 80 percent, and only 20 percent was available to all other forms of transportation Source 1. This issue has caused the legislators to get involved with the problem. Obviously, decreasing the amount of automobiles would be extremely advantageous because they cost everyone money.  Limited car use would be very advantageous because vehicles discourage physical activity, make pollution, and cost everyone money.		0
Studying Venus Remains Worth Pursuing Despite Challenges   The author makes a compelling case that studying Venus warrants continued efforts in spite of the planet's harsh environmental dangers. While exploring Venus poses clear risks, the potential scientific rewards strongly support ongoing exploration as a worthy endeavor.   Several key points in the article back up this assessment. The author notes how little is still understood about Venus' geology, atmosphere and climate history compared to other planets. Given Venus' similarities to Earth in size and composition, gaining new insights about its development and evolution could offer perspective on our own world. Unraveling Venus' mysteries may also deepen understanding of atmospheric greenhouse effects and how terrestrial planets evolve generally. These knowledge fronts present opportunities for major scientific advances with relevance beyond Venus alone.  Of course, any planetary exploration comes with hazards and Venus' extreme conditions raise the risks significantly. Surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead and an atmosphere over 90 times denser than Earth's pose obvious formidable challenges. However, the article outlines ongoing technological progress developing materials and craft designs able to better withstand such pressures and temperatures - progress that could eventually enable surface missions. Robotic orbiters in the meantime can still collect valuable atmospheric data without immediate risks to human life.   Considering the rich potential rewards to science outweighing even serious dangers, the case is strong that studying Venus merits continued dedicated efforts. Although risks cannot be eliminated entirely, steady progress refining Venus-ready technologies suggests the rewards remain achievable through careful, cautious approaches. Venus thus still represents a planetary frontier very much still worth humanity's dedicated efforts to explore and uncover the mysteries within our own planetary neighbor.		1
The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger. Throughout the article, the author supports this claim very well. The author gives a few real benefits for exploring Venus. The author continuously tells us, the readers, about advancing technology thanks to human curiosity. The author even gives problems and solutions to explore Venus.  At the end of the article, paragraph 8, the author says, "Striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." This means that by exploring Venus, we will gain knowledge and be prepared for future missions with similar conditions. Paragraph 4 talks about Venus's past like how it "may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." With knowledge of Venus's past, we could not only learn about Venus more, but we could use that information and compare it to Earth to predict some of Earth's future. That is how Venus's benefits outweighs its dangers.  In paragraph 7, it talks about NASA's interest to study Venus. In doing so, NASA is creating better technology and pushing the human race further. "For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such contitions." With advancing technology thanks to the interest in Venus, we can now create objects that can survive over 800 degrees Fahrenheit on Venus's surface for three weeks. That is how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because we advance with the study.  Throughout the article, many problems are brought up with solutions. For example, paragraph 3 talks about Venus's dangerous conditions that aren't fit for humans, but in paragraph 5, NASA believes they can solve this problem by allowing scientists to float above the chaotic conditions which would allow humans to go to Venus and study it better. Paragraph 6 introduces the problem that humans wouldn't be able to gather a lot of information if they are on a ship orbiting Venus because of its dense atmosphere. In paragraph 7, the article says, "systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces." Paragraph 7 gives us the solution to the problem in paragraph 6. This in turn can also relate to the fact that our technology would advance thanks to the planning for Venus. That is how the author supports his claim by giving us problems and solutions to explore Venus, which negates some of the dangers.  With insight from Venus, advancing technology, and solutions to problems, the author supports his claim. The author tells us about benefits of exploring Venus. The author tells us how technology would advance thanks to the curiosity humans possess for Venus. The author tells us solutions to problems which negates some of the dangers. Therefore, the author supports his claim very well since he gave reasons why the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit, and why some of the dangers aren't a big enough threat to stop humans.		0
"Driverless cars are coming" is an article that informs the reader about cars that can drive themselves; but they also yield warnings about these autonomous cars.  The thought of driverless cars is fascinating! Since 2009, Google has had cars that could drive by themselves under specific situations. This gives the driver a whole new expirence from what has been expected for years. Yes, drivers still have to stay alert and navigate through various traffic issues, such as driveways, constuction work, accidents, etc., but driving just got a whole lot easier.  Automobiles are already on their way! In 2013, BMW announced the development of "Traffic Jam Assistance".  With this function, drivers don't have to worry about the stop and go, but they can worry more about their destination. GM has also added to the technology. They developed seats that would vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing in an object. Now drivers wont have to worry about that blind spot that alwys urks them, because GM has their back.  But don't think that this is all fun and games just because the car is driving for you. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver says this," We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."  Various manufacturers are hoping to bring in-car entertainment and different information systems that use heads-up displays.  So, overall driverless cars are becoming our future. I am completely for this idea. Those of us in the technology era have learned to adapt and this is just another way. People are coming up with new ways to make our lives easier and autonomous cars are just the beginning.		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME  50%  of American students debate !  Community service is very important . But others think it takes too much time away from what they need or want to do . TEACHER_NAME is deciding on whether to require all students to perform community service . There are many ways in which students can help there communities .  I understand that there are those of you who will disagree that TEACHER_NAME  should require all students to perform community service , but research shows that 90% of students that perform community service will be doing themselves and there neighborhoods good !  Experts agree that doing community service will help the world !  OTHER_NAME , award winning community service performer , says " by doing community service you are being a great citizen " ! For instance , doing community service involves doing lots of things like picking up trash so that the environment can be more cleaner , Help recycle so we don't have to kill things like trees and forest , and even going to the nursery homes and showing the elders that they have not been forgotten . Not doing community service is like letting bad people escape from jail , it make the world a less comfortable and even harder place to live in !  12 out of 12 students will not regret making the choice of doing community service .  For example , when i was in 5th grade my school (SCHOOL_NAME) did community service by going outside in the school parking lots , playgrounds , and classrooms to pick up trash and all the litter .  So why not want to do something to help your community ?  Without a doubt , doing community service helps people to learn that it is not a time waster. OTHER_NAME , american citizen and community service program founder , says " doing community service is not a time waster if it's helping your community ! " Not helping your community is like not helping someone that really needs help , heartless! 30 out of 30 people will regret not wanting to do community service after reading this letter ! So why not do community service ?		0
Not every student has the time for extracurricular activity classes. If the principle dose decides to have students do extracurricular activity classes then it should not be counted as a grade. I think this because most students have other classes, grades, and homework to worry about. If the principal require a extracurricular activity classes then students might become stressed.  First, students already have a choice in which related art class they want to take. Even though it is a choice it is still marked as a grade. Related art classes is like a break from class. If the principal requires you extracurricular activity classes then thats taking time from students learning.  Second, feel like students would not have enough learning time in school if extracurricular activity classes gets added to our school hours. Then it might be too much pressure on students and that can effects a students learning. Teachers need time to teach and students need the time to process what they are learning. Some students need more class time to do work therefore extracurricular activity classes might not be the best choice.  Lastly, some students might not be interested in taking¬†extracurricular activity classes. Students might not be interested because they might not have the time for it. Most students will not try in something they are not interested in and some students are not interested. If teachers count this class as a grade then grades might go down because how many classes is taken in a day.  In conclusion, I think all students should have a choice to take extracurricular activityclasses. Not all students have the time or interest to take the class. Will you make your students take this class if you were a principle.¬†		0

Haven't you got an advice from multiple adults in your daily life? Most of the times I believe¬†that people ask for multiple advice from multiple people because they want their adive to impact them in a certain way. However, sometimes one person cannot be convinced by one voice they like to hear multiple voices to be convinced. Most often people are not motivated by themselves which would make it harder for them to be motivated by a single voice because those people needs to hear multiple opinions to make them better or motivated. So let's say that this one person likes to change his or her life and become more motivated, be in the best shape of his or her life, so he or she ask about 10 people how to get motivated¬†and how to work hard to achieve your dreams. Hearing motivating and powerful words from other people can impact your life without you even knowing.  He gets about the same advice from people as he did from the people before and as he heard all of those people talk about the same topic now he or she would be motivated because sometimes not only one voice but two would put a big impact on someone's life and help them. My teachers, friends, family, and all of the people I've met in my life had gave an advice that I heard and took their advice because it meant something to me and it was deep. I would want more people to give me advice that can impact my life, for example my friend's dad always gives him advises¬†but he has hear his dad tell him the same advice over and over again at the end of the day he will get bored and not listen to his dad's advice which would impact him negatively.  Sometimes life gets hard to certain people and they would like to hear advice from multiple people which will impact them in a positive or a negative way depends on who they ask advice from. For example if I were to ask advice from my brother all the time he would just repeat everything he said from before and that would not help me at all, after all they say "two brain is better than one."  Listening to other people's advises can impact you in a way that would make you do the right thing in the future and not only it can impact you it can impact the people around you. You could also use the people's advises you heard and give that advice to another person that also needs to hear it. This is my thoughts on why some people would like multiple and how it can affect them in a certain way.		0
Title: Group Work vs. Individual Work: Which is Better for Students?  As an 8th grader, I have experienced both group work and individual work in my academic journey. While some students might prefer working alone, I believe that working in a group has more benefits for students. Here are some reasons why.  Firstly, group work allows students to learn from each other. When working in a group, we can share our ideas and perspectives, and learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. For example, if one group member is good at math, they can help the others with their math problems. This not only helps the individual students, but also fosters a sense of collaboration and teamwork.  Secondly, group work encourages communication and social skills. When working in a group, we have to communicate effectively to reach a common goal. This means listening to each other, expressing our ideas clearly, and resolving conflicts in a respectful manner. These skills are essential for success in any field, and can help students become better communicators and team players.  Thirdly, group work can be more fun and engaging than individual work. When working alone, students can get bored or lose motivation easily. But when working in a group, students can motivate and inspire each other, making the work more enjoyable and rewarding. For example, if one group member is struggling with a project, the others can offer support and encouragement to help them finish it.  Finally, group work can lead to better learning outcomes. When students work together, they can share their knowledge and experiences, and learn from each other's approaches. This can result in more creative and innovative solutions to problems, and can lead to better grades and academic performance.  In conclusion, while some students might prefer working alone, I believe that working in a group has more benefits for students. Group work promotes collaboration, communication, social skills, and creativity, and can lead to better learning outcomes. So, the next time you have a project or assignment, consider working with a group  ?you might be surprised at how much you can achieve together!		1
Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:  Hey, guys! Today we're talking about this big debate: should the decision regarding extracurricular activities be left to students and their families, or should it be left to the school? Like, I know some people think the school should decide, but I think it should be us kids and our families who get to decide. Here's why:  First of all, we kids have way too much pressure already. Like, we have to do homework and study for tests and stuff, and then we have to go to sports practice or club meetings after school. It's like, can't we just have some time to chill and relax? But no, we have to do all this extra stuff that's not even required. And it's not like we get paid for it or anything! So, why do we have to do it?  And another thing, when do we get to do our school work? Like, I know I'm supposed to do my math homework every night, but if I'm at soccer practice until 5:30, I don't get home until 6. So, how am I supposed to do my homework then? It's not like I can just do it on my phone during practice. And don't even get me started on studying for tests. I mean, I know I'm supposed to study, but it's hard to focus when I'm tired from practice.  And then there's the thing about working. Like, some of us have to work after school to help pay for stuff, like uniforms and equipment for sports or whatever. So, if we're working, we can't be doing extracurricular activities. It's just not fair.  So, here's why I think the decision should be left to students and their families. We know our own schedules and what we can handle, and we know what we want to do. We don't need some principal or teacher telling us what to do. It's like, we're the ones who have to do the work and deal with the consequences, so we should get to decide what we want to do.  In conclusion, I think it's totally		1
Some resones to join the program are that you can help people after they have had a hard time. The situation from the text is after World War ll there was alot of destruction in Europe. So Luke went over to Europe to help people get thier lives back. Being a Seagoing Cowboy wasn't all just work you also got to travle the world and see cool places. He said that he and other people on the boat had fun on the way back.  He said that he saw some cool places, and did cool thing, like seeing the Panama Canal or go on a gandola ride in Veince, Italy. Whe the stalls were emty ,he said, that alot of guys on the ship would play games to make the time pass. Some of the games that he had mentoined were baseball, volleyball, table tennis, and many others. They helped pass the time by playing games, is what he said.  I think that he made it sound very appealing to be a Seagoing Cowboy it definetily had it's up's an down's. Like cleaning the stals would be a down, and a up would be playing games. Also being able to go see and do things in other parts of the world.        		0
Phones and Driving  Upon the development of handheld computers, more commonly known as "smart phones," the question arises whether, when driving, they are a necessity or a deterrent. Both sides of the argument induced by this question are accurate in some way and folly in another; and so there will always be debate over the subject, with both sides just as right and just as wrong as the other for different reasons. To elaborate upon this further, one might argue that phones should not be allowed in motorized vehicles while they are being operated due to the implication of a distraction. On the other hand, however, one might also argue the necessity of GPS and availability for work. Some laws are put in place to help prevent accidents through negligence because of the need to sometimes carry a device; the only trouble is that people abuse the rights they do have and many can be found texting or holding a phone up to their ear with only one hand or nothing but their knee on the steering wheel. Not only do those drivers have less control of the steering wheel, but they also often get distracted by conversation and drive recklessly. These individuals are the ones the counter argument against phones in motor vehicles will often refer to. The argument about phones and driving is controversial to say the least, and while often neglected it is important to carefully analyze all factors contributing before speaking or constructing an argument or opinion about the subject.  Cell phones did not exist when cars were first beginning to be produced on a massive scale in 1908 with Henry Ford's Model T, and wouldn't exist for another sixty five years after its development. Laws were never necessary for the implication of cellphones because they did not yet exist, but when cellphones were invented they, in certain cases, became a real problem for people on the road. Since then the cell phone has advanced in an amazing way, rather than a big brick . The first computer was a enormous invention, large enough that one could easily fill an entire room. Today, we have advanced so much on the principle of the computer that we have eventually developed a hand held portable computer that is now in everybody's pockets. Also to be noted is that the first cellular phone was by no means the super computers they are today; they too were big and bulky, and were only good for making phone calls like an ordinary telephone. These amazing advancements have become the very necessities we rely on today, the great majority of which developed only in recent years, and are now staples of modern society.  The most controversial subject outside of laws already put in place about cell phones and driving is manner of necessity, and manner of liability.  There is no one correct party in this argument, because there is always a valid and considerable counter argument to every point which can be made on either which side; wherefore every argument which can be made is only a half truth. The folly of individuals on both polarities of the argument is the inability to understand the importance or reason behind any opinion that in any way opposes their own. The fact of the matter is, neither of which party is entirely correct in their accusations based on the bias of their opinion on the subject. Cell phones are an important and useful tool, whether you need to carry one at all times for work or simply the convenience of having a device with which you can get ahold of outside sources in dire conditions and utilize the availability of GPS if needed. People should most certainly keep their cell phones with them while their driving; but people are often known to abuse this right by recklessly focusing on their device at unnecessary times when driving. To utilize your device properly is the best option rather than to follow each extreme of all or nothing, but the problem still stands and will always stand for the sheer fact that motorized vehicles and cell phones simply exist that there will be those who will not follow this code of conduct, despite any laws which could be implemented.  The general population needs to be encouraged somehow to go about their business responsibly. Unfortunately, this is next to impossible to achieve by any conceivable means on a large scale, and certainly impossible to convince every individual entirely. This will always be a problem in society with any and all causes, and it is up to the rest to withhold these laws and maintain both order and safety. The only thing people can truly do to resolve a situation where somebody is recklessly driving due to negligence while texting or otherwise using their mobile device, is to report the incident to law enforcement for the safety of other individuals on the road. Motorized vehicles are a wonderful utility but they are unsafe, accidents can happen simply by not being careful and often result in death or serious injury.  The best and only thing we can do is to just drive with caution and alertness at all times, especially considering that people are unpredictable and anything can happen on the road.  \  3 1      		0
 Car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular worldwide. There are many advantages to limiting car usage within cities, including reduced traffic congestion, improved air quality, and increased exercise for citizens. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of car-free cities, and examine the reasons why they are on the rise.  One significant advantage of a car-free city is reduced traffic congestion. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of rush hour traffic, and cities that have implemented car-free policies have seen a significant decrease in congestion. This decrease in congestion leads to quicker travel times for public transportation and cycling, two alternative modes of transportation that become more appealing in car-free cities. Additionally, car-free cities often have broader and more efficient public transportation systems, allowing people to get around even quicker than they would if they were driving a car, in addition to the fact that a fewer number of cars means less waiting time at traffic lights.  Another advantage of car-free cities is improved air quality. Cars are a significant source of air pollution, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities limit the amount of pollution that is released into the air. This improvement in air quality leads to healthier citizens and a better environment. In addition to the reduction in pollution, noise levels are also decreased in car-free cities, contributing to a cleaner and more peaceful environment.  Car-free cities have also been found to lead to increased exercise for citizens. In cities where car usage is limited, people are encouraged to walk, cycle, or use public transportation instead of driving. This increase in activity resulting from a car-free city leads to more physically active citizens, with associated health benefits, such as lower rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease.  There are also economic benefits to car-free cities. Car ownership and maintenance can be expensive, and car-free cities allow individuals and businesses to save money on these expenses. Additionally, car-free cities often see an increase in tourism, as the reduced congestion and improved air quality make them more attractive to visitors. The increase in tourism can bring economic benefits to the city, including increased employment opportunities and revenue generation.  In conclusion, car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular worldwide, and they offer many advantages. By reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, and increasing exercise for citizens, car-free cities contribute to a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable environment. Additionally, car-free cities can save individuals and businesses money on car ownership and maintenance, and can bring economic benefits to the city in the form of increased tourism. As such, cities worldwide are exploring the possibilities of car-free polices to bring about these advantages.		1

Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! üòÖ For my essay, I'm gonna tackle the question of whether or not students should be allowed to use their cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. üì±  First off, let's talk about the pros of using cell phones in the classroom. üìù For one, they can be super helpful for learning. We can use them to look up information, take notes, and even access educational apps that can make learning more fun and interactive. Plus, they can help us stay organized and keep track of our assignments. üìÖ It's like having a little computer in our hands! üíª  But, there are also some cons to consider. ü§î For instance, if we're not using our phones for educational purposes, we might end up getting distracted by social media or games. üò≥ And let's be real, who doesn't love a good scroll through Instagram? üòú But, if we're not careful, we might end up wasting time and not learning as much as we could be. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ ?  So, what's the solution? ü§î In my opinion, teachers should set clear rules and guidelines for when and how students can use their phones in the classroom. üìù For example, they could only be allowed to use them during breaks or for specific activities, like researching information or taking notes. That way, we can still use our phones to help us learn, but we won't get distracted by other things. üí°  In conclusion, allowing students to use cell phones in the classroom can be beneficial, but it's important to set clear rules and guidelines to make sure we're using them responsibly. üì±üìö By doing this, we can make the most of this technology and learn as much as possible! ü§ìüéâ  So, what do you think? Should cell phones be allowed in the classroom? Let me know in the comments! ü§îüìù		1
Hi, I am Luke Bomberger. I am also known as a Seagoing Cowboy. I am here today to try to persuade you to join the Seagoing Cowboys. What you do as a Seagoing Cowboy is deliver supplies and food for the cattle of the people's homes that were distroyed in World War 2. I know that you think this might sound boring but it is actually really intresting because you get to go to alot of different places and see alot of sights. For example, '' I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and china. But seeing the Acropolis in greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Pananama Canal on my way to China.'' Now I bet you see how fun it is to be a Seagoing Cowboy, so come and join!		0

In recent years, some schools have incorporated meditation and mindfulness practices into their daily routines. While some may believe that these practices are beneficial, I am against their inclusion in schools for a number of reasons.  First and foremost, I do not believe that meditation and mindfulness practices have a place in the academic setting. Schools are meant to be places of learning, where students can develop important skills and knowledge that will prepare them for their future lives and careers. Meditation and mindfulness practices, on the other hand, are typically associated with spirituality and personal growth. While these practices may be valuable for some individuals, they do not belong in a school setting.  Furthermore, I believe that there are better ways for schools to help students develop important skills like focus, concentration, and stress management. For example, schools could offer classes on time management, organization, and study skills. These classes would be more directly relevant to students' academic experiences, and would be more likely to help students succeed in their studies.  Finally, I worry that the inclusion of meditation and mindfulness practices in schools could lead to some students feeling uncomfortable or excluded. These practices are often associated with specific religious or cultural traditions, and not all students may feel comfortable participating in them. Additionally, some students may simply not be interested in meditation or mindfulness practices, and may feel pressured to participate in order to fit in with their peers.  In conclusion, while some may argue that meditation and mindfulness practices have a place in schools, I believe that they do not belong in the academic setting. Schools should focus on providing students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed academically and professionally, rather than incorporating spiritual practices that may not be relevant or inclusive for all students.		1
I personally am all for the driverless cars idea. Through time, everything has evolved and is still eveolving to newer and better ideas of the original. For example, we started with little shacks, now we have skyscrapers, we rode horses now we have cars, we had mail, now we have email or texting, the point I am trying to make is everything needs to evolve for us to improve anything. Technology is a big part of our lives today and we rely on it for most of anything and everything.  Every year we have thousands maybe millions of deaths and injuries resulting from car crashes, the fact of the matter is, people are irresponsible and reckless. We have drunk driving, texting and driving, and simply just not paying attention that causes all these wrecks and I believe that driverless cars could solve all these problems and save a lot of lives.  Driverless cars could also solve other problems such as gas prices. In the story it mentions that driverless cars use half the amount of gas as taxis do and they are way more efficient. People could have a lot more money spending half the amount of money they usually do on gas. Do you know how much money people spend on gas? A lot. So these are the reasons that I am all for driverless cars, it's the next big thing, why would we say no to that?  		0
 The electoral college is a system used in the United States to elect the president. It is composed of 538 electors, divided among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The electors are chosen by each state's political party, and each state has a number of electors equal to the number of its Senators and Representatives in Congress.  One of the main criticisms of the electoral college is that it can be unfair to smaller states. While larger states have more electoral votes, smaller states have just as much sway over the outcome of the election. This is because one elector from a state can determine the outcome of the election, so even though smaller states have fewer electors, they can still have a significant impact on the outcome.  Another criticism is that it can be difficult for third-party candidates to succeed. In the Electoral College system, a candidate needs to win at least 270 electoral votes to be elected president. This can make it difficult for smaller, third-party candidates to succeed, as they may not get enough support to reach that number. This can lead to the election of two candidates with differing viewpoints, which could result in a government that does not reflect the will of the people.  However, supporters of the electoral college argue that it preserves the principles of national unity and federalism. In the Electoral College system, all states are given a voice, regardless of their population. This means that rural states and urban states, as well as large states and small states, all have a say in the election. Additionally, some argue that the electoral college provides a check on the influence of major cities and metropolitan areas on the election.  In conclusion, the electoral college is a system used to elect the president in the United States. It has both its positive and negative aspects. While it can be unfair to smaller states and difficult for third-party candidates to succeed, it also preserves the principles of national unity and federalism. It is up to policymakers to consider the best way to improve the election process and ensure that it reflects the will of the people.		1
**The Challenge of Exploring Venus: Evaluating the Author's Support for Studying Venus Despite the Dangers**  In his article ‚ÄúThe Challenge of Exploring Venus, ?David Grinspoon argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He cites several reasons for this, including the planet‚Äôs proximity to Earth, its potential habitability, and its unique geology. However, Grinspoon‚Äôs argument is not without its flaws. He downplays the dangers of Venus‚Äôs atmosphere and surface conditions, and he fails to adequately address the ethical concerns that arise from sending humans to explore the planet.  **Grinspoon‚Äôs Arguments for Studying Venus**  Grinspoon begins his argument by noting that Venus is our closest planetary neighbor. This proximity makes it the easiest planet to reach, and it also means that we can study Venus in greater detail than any other planet in our solar system. Grinspoon argues that this proximity makes Venus ‚Äúa natural first stop ?for our exploration of space.  Grinspoon also argues that Venus may once have been habitable. He cites evidence that Venus once had a thick atmosphere and a surface ocean. If this is true, then Venus could provide valuable insights into the early history of our solar system. Grinspoon argues that studying Venus could help us to understand how life began on Earth, and it could also help us to identify other planets in our solar system that may be habitable.  Finally, Grinspoon argues that Venus‚Äôs unique geology is worth studying. He notes that Venus has a very active surface, with volcanoes and tectonic plates that are constantly moving. This geology is unlike anything we see on Earth, and it could provide valuable insights into the formation of planets.  **Grinspoon‚Äôs Arguments Against Studying Venus**  Grinspoon‚Äôs arguments for studying Venus are compelling, but his argument is not without its flaws. First, Grinspoon downplays the dangers of Venus‚Äôs atmosphere and surface conditions. He acknowledges that Venus is hot and has a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, but he argues that these conditions are not as dangerous as they seem. Grinspoon claims that we could send robots to explore Venus without having to worry about the atmosphere or the surface conditions. However, this argument is not convincing. The atmosphere of Venus is so dense that it would crush any robot that tried to land on the planet. The surface of Venus is also so hot that it would melt any robot that tried to walk on it.  Second, Grinspoon fails to adequately address the ethical concerns that arise from sending humans to explore Venus. He acknowledges that sending humans to Venus would be dangerous, but he argues that the risks are worth taking. Grinspoon claims that the potential benefits of exploring Venus outweigh the risks. However, this argument is debatable. It is difficult to say whether the benefits of exploring Venus would outweigh the risks to human life.  **Conclusion**  Grinspoon makes a strong case for studying Venus. The planet is our closest planetary neighbor, it may once have been habitable, and it has a unique geology. However, Grinspoon‚Äôs argument is not without its flaws. He downplays the dangers of Venus‚Äôs atmosphere and surface conditions, and he fails to adequately address the ethical concerns that arise from sending humans to explore the planet. Overall, Grinspoon‚Äôs argument is persuasive, but it is not without its flaws.		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I think it would be a bad idea if the school district and your self would allow everyone to bring there cell phones to school , even if there turned off during class. I don't think its okay because its during lunch time and free periods, students should be socializing at that time. I also don't think that it will teach students to be more responsible for there stuff.  I do not agree because some students are mean and curl. They just don't care! They will take other people stuff, and sometimes if they don't like that person they will brake there things just to seem cool. When they are not!  When all that happens the first thing they will do is run to the administration or to the principals. Then parents will get involved. It will just cause to much problems, when students should just be focused on learning and getting a good education cause that's what school is for its to be someone successful in life.  So TEACHER_NAME  I don't think you should allow students to bring there phones to school. There would be to many problems, and our school doesn't need that. Students just need to get a good education. Come on isn't that what schools for? For all students to be successful in life ?		0
Some know think venus is not a planet. Some know venus is a planet but we all can agree that it is very intresting but why would we use resources to get to venus here are some reasons why and not allow me to show you if it,s worth it. venus is not the farthest planet it is actually not too far so it makes it a viable option. The only thing is is that we have not been able to examine venus with amount of distance between earth and venus which doesn,t give us a lot of options but here is what we do know.  First of all venus is known as earths twin and it,s not called earths twin for no reason. Venus is the same size and density which would make it more acustomed to our way of liveing. sometimes venus is actually even the closest planet so if we timed it right it would make it less the journey. The only things is not a single unmanned ship has not survived for more than a few hours when sent to venus.  Basically this tells us at the moment that mars is a more viable option because we have actually landed unmanned ships on it to collect data this is why many people talk about mars instead of venus. Some problems that get in our way is the air venus has a thick atmosphere 97 percent is carbon dioxide. Not only that but venus atmosphere has highly corrosive acid the eviorment is much more harsh than earth.  This means that it will be a long time before we get to venus are bodies have adapted to earth over the years but it took over 2000 years for us to adapt to this level we can,t wait that long. Our savior nasa is actually coming with ideas to get us there at the moment they have been thinking of makeing blimp like vechile which will hover and fly high to avoid storms and what not. Though it would still be hot but the air pressure is close enough to sea level.  What to expect from nasa in the furture a blimp that might make us be able to get more data from venus. Maybe one day we will be able to inhabit venus with the ideas they are coming up with. The fact of the matter is that it,s going to a long time until we get their. So it seems mars is the better option for now. 		0
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the pros and cons of graduating early from high school as an average 8th grade student:  Hey, so I've been thinking about graduating early from high school and I wanted to write about it. It's like, a big decision and stuff. Some people think it's a good idea, but others don't. So, let's talk about the pros and cons.  First, the pros. If you graduate early, you can get a head start on college or whatever you want to do after high school. You can take college classes or get a job or something. It's like, you're not stuck in high school forever. You can do what you want, when you want. And, you know, it looks good on college apps or whatever. Like, you're not just some lazy kid who didn't finish high school. You're like, a motivated person who's taking charge of their life.  But, there are also cons. Like, you might miss out on some stuff in high school. You might not get to hang out with your friends as much or participate in sports or clubs. And, you know, you might not be ready for college yet. It's like, you might not be mature enough or whatever. You might have to take a gap year or something. That's not cool.  And, there's also the thing where you might not be able to get into college if you graduate early. Some colleges don't accept early graduates or something. So, you might have to find another way to get into college. That's like, stressful.  But, overall, I think the pros and cons of graduating early are pretty even. It's like, it's a big decision and you should think about it carefully. Some people might think it's a good idea, but others might not. It's like, you have to decide what's best for you.  So, yeah, that's my essay. I hope it helps. Let me know what you think!		1
The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads one point six million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from texting and driving. Texting while driving is something that people have done in the past, they are doing it today, and are still going to do it in the future. No matter how people are injured or have lost their lives to this people are still going to do it. Some of the main reasons that you should not text while driving is because; you can cause serious accidents that way, you are more likely to be blamed for causing the accident and it is illegal to be on the phone in some states.  According to a new study talking on the phone is hugely dangerous even if you are on hands free. There are thousands of people who get into accidents everyday because they were not paying attention to the road. They were to busy looking down at their phones to notice what was going on around them. If you are paying attention to what you are doing you can only injure yourself but you can also injure another person as well.  Most likely if you are texting while driving and end up getting into an accident then you are most likely to get blamed than the other person. There is a high chance of it being your fault because you were not paying attention to the road. Yow will also probably get charged by your insurance company and have to pay more if the other person decides to file a lawsuit against you. Being distracted for even one minute can change a whole lot and make a big difference.  Even though it may not be illegal in Georgia right now, one day it could become illegal for people to drive and talk on the phone. In the state of Missouri people under the age of 21 can not talk and drive at the same time. It is against the law because they are not of age to be trusted to talk and text while driving. They are at a high risk more than anyone else to get into an accident because they are underage teenagers who do not know how to stay off their phone.  Most car accidents are caused by people who think that they can drive and pay attention to the road while also doing something else. The main people who think that they can do that are the main ones that get into the most accidents and get the most tickets. Texting while driving is dangerous for you and for the people around you. That is why sometimes people say you have to drive for the people around you. You never know what someone is doing in there car and whether they are paying attention or not. They also have to do the same for you if you are not paying attention to the road and what you are doing.      		0
As a student, if I don't understand something in class, I will ask someone about it. Whether that is a teacher, a student, or a parent there is almost always someone who knows. If any one of these reliable sources does not know, I can most likely look it up on one of my devices that has the internet. If we were to introduce the new FACS technology, it may have unindended lasting impacts which could be detrimental to our society.  It was mentioned in the passage on paragraph 6 that " 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modiy the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "  The first reason that it could be bad for our society as a whole is that it is not the computer's duty to explain how to do everything and to change to our will. While computers were made to help us, it cannot be our only source of information. On the other hand, teachers are st school for the sole purpose of helping you learn. It is their actual job to be there to help you learn things. While computers are a tool to help achieve this goal, there are other ways to learn about things and get them explained to you.  When you are in highschool, many teachers and parents will say things to you along the lines of "In the real world" and " Highschool is preparing you for the real world". Later on in life, "in the real world", if you get bored at a job you cannot just change what you are doing. You have to continue on with it because it is your job. If we implemented this system now in schools, many kids and teens would get in their mindset that if they are bored or don't understand something, things will change for them. Kids should not rely on a computer to help them understand everything. There are teachers, classmates, parents, and other adults who can help.  The second reason why this could be bad for our society is the accessibility. Not every school has computers and not every class uses them. If we were to implement this software, it could be giving an unfair advantage to the students who had acsess to it. There are still plenty of schools that may not have a computer in every classroom. Similarly, not all students and parents can afford this kind of technology. Because of how new and high-tech this software is it most likely will cost more money to be put into effect. This would cause the schools with more money to be able to get it while the schools with less funding and less money to be pushed aside and not get it. This causes the students at the schools that cannnot afford it to have a disadvantage.  The third and final reason why this could be bad for our society as a whole is simply that people may become less sensitive to reading other peoples emotions. Without needing to have face- to- face human interactions to see how people are feeling, it could result in a decline of being able to recognize emotions in facial expressions.  I learned a few chords on the ukulele this summer. I could piece together a song or two. Now after a few months, I can't remember the first thing about playing those chords. This example shows that if you learn something then don't do it for an extended period of time, it will take a while to relearn how to do it. Although reading emotions is nothing like playing ukulele, the same holds true; if you learn something, and rely on something else to help you do it, it is going to be hard for you to re-learn how to do it again.  People also have a right to privacy and some people may not enjoy those particular rights being breached. I am a person who does not let all of my emotions show. Other people may bottle these feelings up in hopes that nobody will see. If people want to keep in how they feel, they should be able to do that as it is what they want.  Because it is not the computers duty to exlain everything to you, not everyone has accsess to this kind of software, and people may lose their sensitivity to the fine art of emotion reading, I am in opposition of implementing this FACS technology.   		0
Hey there!  So, I'm gonna write about how achieving goals can affect your self-esteem.  I think it's super important to talk about this because, like, it can really help you feel better about yourself when you accomplish something.  First of all, when you set a goal and work towards it, it's like this huge accomplishment when you finally achieve it. It's like,  "YEAH, I DID IT!" And it's not just about the goal itself, but also how hard you had to work to get there. It's like, you pushed yourself and you're like, "Wow, I'm so much stronger than I thought I was!" And that's when you start to feel good about yourself.  But it's not just about feeling good, it's also about how it makes you want to keep going. When you accomplish something, it's like, you're like, "Okay, now I can do this other thing too!" And you start to push yourself even harder. It's like, you're on this roll of accomplishing things and it's so cool.   And it's not just about the big goals either. Like, even small goals can make a big difference. When you, like, finally get that A on a test or something, it's like, "Wow, I'm so proud of myself!" And it's not just about the grade, it's about the fact that you worked hard and it paid off. It's like, you're like, "Yeah, I did that!" And it's a great feeling.  But, like, the best part is when you start to internalize it. When you're like, "Yeah, I can do this. I'm capable and I'm gonna keep pushing myself." It's like, you start to believe in yourself more and more. And that's when you start to feel like, "Wow, I'm actually pretty cool."   And, like, the science backs it up too. There are these studies that show that when people achieve their goals		1
Dear senator i was wondering what the electoral college was. And iv noticed that its unfair .Because of the winner-take-all system,the posablet of a tie. of couser there are more reasons but those are the top two.  Many american people think the electoral college is unfair Because of the winner-takes-all system. Which is when candates dont spend time in state they know there not going to win. For example in the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt get to see who they where even voting for. And some of the largest media markets didnt see a campaign ad. Ever one should at least get to see who mit be running the U.S.A. If the president was picked on most poppler vote the people would see who there voting for and also see what there are plans are for the U.S.  Another big reason the electoral college should be changed is because of the posablet of a tie. Many people are worried about this because the responablaite of chocing the president would be the house of represantives. Which is unfair because each state has only one vote. For example let say florida represenates 400,000 people, they would have as much to say to texas who represenates 1 millon people. But if the president was chocien by polpular vote then there could never be a tie and voter would have a changes to vote for who they really want.  All and all the electrol college should be changed. Because of the winner takes all system and the posablet of tie. The college has worked for a long time now but i think the american people are ready for a change.       ¬†¬†¬†    		0
Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student!  I'm super excited to write this essay about the impact of technology on the world.   So, like, technology has totally changed the game when it comes to communication. I mean, we can literally talk to people on the other side of the world in real-time!  It's like, what did people do before Facetime and Skype?  Write letters?  That sounds so ancient.  But, on the other hand, technology can also be super distracting. I mean, have you seen how much time people waste scrolling through TikTok?  It's like, come on, get off your phone and go outside!   And don't even get me started on commerce. Online shopping is so much easier than going to the mall.  I mean, I love shopping, but it's just so much faster and more convenient to buy stuff online.  Plus, you can find so much better deals online.   But, the downside is that it's also super easy to get scammed or buy things you don't need.  Like, have you seen those ads that pop up on your computer?  They're like, "Buy this amazing product that will change your life!"  And you're like, "Uh, no thanks."   And then there's entertainment. Like, have you seen Netflix?  It's like, the best thing since sliced bread.  I mean, you can watch whatever you want, whenever you want.  But, the downside is that it can be super addictive.  Like, I've been binge-watching this show for hours and suddenly it's 3 AM.  Oops.  So, in conclusion, technology has had both positive and negative effects on the world.  It's		1
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student in response to the prompt:  Hey, guys! Today we're gonna talk about student-mentor programs and how they're super helpful for both mentors and mentees. Like, I know some people might be thinking, "Why do we need mentor programs? Can't we just, like, figure things out on our own?" But trust me, having a mentor can make a huge difference in your life.  First of all, mentors are like, super cool people who have been around for a while and know a lot of stuff. They can teach you stuff that you might not learn in class, like how to manage your time, how to study for tests, and how to be responsible. And they're not just like, "Hey, do this and you'll be fine." They actually take the time to listen to you and help you figure things out. Like, my mentor last year helped me with my math homework and stuff, and I was so grateful.  But it's not just about the academic stuff. Mentor programs can also help you develop important life skills, like communication, problem-solving, and teamwork. Like, imagine being able to work on a project with someone who's been around for a while and can give you advice and support. It's like, so much better than trying to figure things out on your own.  And guess what? These skills are super important in jobs too! Employers are always looking for people who can work well with others, communicate clearly, and solve problems. So even if you're not planning on becoming a math teacher or anything, having a mentor can still help you succeed in life.  Now, I know some people might be thinking, "But what about the mentees? What do they get out of it?" Well, let me tell you, being a mentee is just as important as being a mentor! You get to learn from someone who's been around for a while and can teach you new things. And you also get to develop those important life skills that I was talking about earlier. Plus, it's just cool to have someone to talk to and hang out with.  And let's not forget about the		1
Classes are important as they teach people the skills they will need in the future. Some schools offer online classes that can be taken from home, but the question of do they actually benefit students still remains.¬†Students might say attending online classes would make it easier for them to learn, but with distractions everywhere and no hands on experiences students would struggle.  Distractions can be found anywhere. Schools try to limit the amount of distractions so students can have the best learning environment. At home distractions can be found left and right like TVs, phones, video games, and much more. Students might want to take a small breaks from their classes by going on their phone or watching TV. It is good for students to take small breaks, but sometime students will start taking longer and longer breaks and in the end just straight up procrastinating. While it could just start as a small distraction, it could eventually¬†cause students to put off work and their grades to start dropping.  A lot of students learn better from hands on experiences. While just listening and writing down what you learn is sometimes good enough, some classes like biology, chemistry, and physics are easier to understand through labs. Online classes do not normally provide the materials needed for labs. While some labs you can do with materials at home, some require more dangerous materials like an open flame, sharp objects, or dangerous chemicals. Even if students can do the lab at home teachers are usually there to help or explain how the lab relates to the subject students are learning.  In the end I do not think online classes are that beneficial for students. While students could possibly learn at their own pace, with large amount of distractions at home and students needing hands on experiences to fully understand what they learn I think it is best if students stick to classes at school.   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†		0
In the article, "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author presents themself really well with claims backed up by strong evidence. Venus has a lot of similarities with Earth, but hasn't been reserached enough throughout the years which needs to change in order for the future to be able to pursue their goals. The author makes a clear point in the article and supports their text with evidence to prove why society has the chance to research further into Venus and find out so much more about our neighboring planet. Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because of the similarities we share among them, the close distance between us, and the history that Venus has had which could've possibly "supported various forms of life."  First, Venus and Earth share a lot of similarities within themselves. "Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." Also, many years ago, there are speculations that Venus was probably full of oceans and could suport many different types of life, just as Earth was too. Many people may argue that since it was awhile ago, it can be completely different now which is true, but the author explains themself perfectly because they add that it still shares many features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Lastly, although the temperatures differ between the two planets, the author provides a great alternative to hover 30 miles above the surface of Venus. This way, people are still in contact with Venus, but remain safe with the conditions that they have put themselves in.  Furthermore, the close distance between Earth and Venus make it a lot easier for travel and research. Although that they are still far distances away, it is very close when comparing planets, and the convienence of being close provides the chance of quality research, and possibly visiting in the near future. "Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner--in space terms--humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world." None of the spacecrafts survived more than a few hours, but that quote should motivate and challenge the workers and future workers of NASA to hopefully get the working pieces together to form a spacecraft that can survive long amounts of time.  Lastly, since Venus once could've supported various forms of life, the possibility to be able to support life again is quite high. With the right tools and research, we as a society can make an effort and use our curiosity as motivation to fight to be able to obtain life on Venus. With the surplus amounts of valleys, mountains, and craters that it has today, humans should not fear Venus for the fact that we have these features on Earth as well. The author once again provides a great statement because providing knowledge that both planets have similarties is crucial, and may even be a reason to explore and research further into Venus.  In conclusion, the author supports the idea of studying Venus as a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents well because of how close the two planets are, the many similarities that both planets share, and also the history of Venus once supporting life. With the right research, dedication, and curiosity, the future of possibilities for studying Venus or even traveling there is endless.		0
Are seeking multiple opinions to help someone make a better decision helpful? Do they really restrain someone from making a terrible decision that cost them everything? Well, I know if I was stuck on making a really tough decision, I would turn to people I trust. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision because other people may be wiser, they may have been in the same situation, and they may have a different point of view on things. Sometimes, looking for other opinions can help somebody stay out of a detention center or jail. If most were stuck in a situation like that, they would turn to multiple opinions. Who would not?  My first reason for why I think that other opinions can help someone make a better decision is because the other people may be wiser. If a person has more knowledge, they can help make a better decision with a better outcome. that is like an Eagle teaching its babies how to hunt and track down food without dying. Other people also may make better choices, which then lead them to being successful and not get in trouble. This is my first reason for why I think that multiple opinions can help somebody.  My second reason for why I think seeking multiple opinions can help somebody is because they may have been in the same situation before. An example of this is widely used in schools across America and especially at my school. Students ask other students and friends questions different assignments. This can be good because if someone has already been through something, they are more capable of passing good information on to somebody else. And students are not the only group of people who use methods like these, it happens in everyday life. Online reviews of restaurants and stores is also a good example of how other opinions can help someone make a better decision. If a family was looking for a good place to eat because they were really hungry, they could look at the reviews and other people's opinions to help them make a better decision on where to spend their hard earned money. This is my second reason for why I think that finding multiple opinions help others make better decisions.  My third and final reason for why I think that seeking multiple opinions is helpful to somebody is because others may have a different point of view on things. It is always helpful to get an opinion through someone else's eyes. Some people's brains do not function the same and others may think differently than some. But what may seem stupid and wrong to some may sound fantastic and right to others. This is my final reason for why I think that seeking multiple opinions is helpful for making a better decision.  In conclusion, I feel like seeking multiple opinions from others is the best way to make a better decision. It is not mandatory that people ask for other's opinions to help make a better decision but it is very helpful and may have a better outcome. I think that every person should seek another's opinion, but they do not have to if they do not want to. Finding other's opinions can also help a lot¬†of trouble makers in school, teens disobeying their parents, and adults making bad decisions that send them to jail. All in all, I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help somebody make a better decision		0
Although some say schools should not offer classes online because when students are out of school someone else could be doing the work for them and they will not be learning anything, actually schools should offer classes online because most of the students who go to schools have to work and they drop out of school to work and taking classes online would help them be educated at the same time they're working.  Those who believe schools should offer classes online have their reasons because research shows that 80% of the students that go to high school work after school. They get home late and they have to do homework, and they go to bed too late and having to wake up at least at 7 am to go school it's hard. They are falling asleep in class and they don't want to do any work. Taking classes online helps because they can take them at anytime.  Also, some students have to walk to get to school. In winter they have to suffer all the cold weather and that's what make them sick. Last year I saw a student who broke his arm cause it was snowing and the sidewalk was really slippery,and I also saw a guy who got beat up by a group of guys on the street he was on his way home,and if they can take classes online they would not have to walk to school, and those situations wouldn't happen.  In addition, research shows that 70% of the students that have attended classes online have been successful which means taking classes online really helps students. They can rest more at home and they don't have to wake up early every morning.  In conclusion,schools should provide classes online because colleges,universities also provide them and most of the people who have taken them have been successful from their classes. That is the best thing schools could do for the students.		0
While distance learning offers flexibility and convenience, I believe students would benefit more from attending traditional in-person classes. There are a few key reasons for this.  First, learning from home could negatively impact students' social development and mental well-being. Part of the school experience is socializing and interacting with peers. At home, students may feel isolated without in-person interactions during breaks and after school. The social aspects of school are important for developing social skills and helping to prevent loneliness or depression.   Second, it can be difficult for students to stay focused and motivated while learning from home. There are many distractions at home like TV, phones, video games and chores that may tempt students. It requires strong self-discipline to avoid distractions and stick to an at-home schedule. Younger students especially may struggle without the structured environment of a classroom.  Third, online classes lack the hands-on learning experiences that in-person classes provide. Some subjects like lab sciences, arts, sports and trades benefit greatly from practical demonstrations and activities that simply cannot be replicated remotely. The experiential nature of these classes enhances understanding and retention of the material. It also allows students to get help from and ask questions to their teachers in real-time.  While distance learning offers flexibility, I believe the social and educational benefits of traditional in-person classes outweigh this convenience. Students' well-being and development are best supported through direct engagement and teaching within a structured school environment. Therefore, attending physical classes at school would be more beneficial for students than distance learning from home.		1
As I was reading the article " Driveless Cars Are Coming" I was thinking this can't be serious. This article was about smart cars and how they will improve. The article talks about how people that " drive" them will no longer need to pretty much drive, the cars will do it for them.  They claim it is still safe or even safer than a human driving but we have to think about cases that randomly occur, like someone that doesn't have a smart car running a light. What if it isn't your turn to drive so you see the car coming last minute but your on autopliot so you can't save a life or perhaps your own. The article gives a description about the features of the car. For instense one car, a Toyota Prius has position sensors on the left rear wheel, a video camera for tracking distance from other cars, and an inertial motion sensor etc. They claim that their cars are safe and only improving, but we should'nt add on to all the accidents, we already have so many a year and having to deal with technology gone wrong will not help us only hurt us.  I am currently against this development because I don't think it is a good fit or will add any good. The first reason I am against these cars is because in the article it says "laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident." also says, " if the techonolgy fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer"? these quotes show a strong idea of how much manufacturers care about the safety of people using their cars... not very much. They were implying that if an accident case acurres and someone is injured because of their technology messing up , they should'nt be held accountable. That is insane , they should take the responsiblity for what their product has done.  To conclude I am against driveless cars because they will create more issues, disadvantages than advantages. The smart cars aren't very safe and people that drive them are more prone to accidents from small altercations that may occur on the road. Also if you purchase a smart car and happen to get in an accident the manufacturers will not be liable, even if it is because of their cars.       		0
The facial action coding system is a computer system where it can actually tell how you're really feeling instead of just looking at your face when you're smiling and say oh, you're happy no it actually looks beyond that and can tell you hgow you're feeling.  I think the coding system could actually be helpful or valuable in the classroom . The text states that a classroom computer could recognize when the student is becoming bored or confused." If a student is on lets say like ixl ( a math website) and is stuck on a problem like they are confused the system could actually break it down and help them with the problem.  The facial coding system could actually be valuable to about almost anyone . IT could maybe replace therapists and or guidance counselors because the computer could read how theyre feeling and make them feel happy if theyre sad . It could very well ask them questions on how their day was or by simply giving them a compliment . I would keep testing it to make sure it wont mess up or make the users mad enough to where they break it or get mad at it and throw it down because what you want to do is make them happy. 		0
Cars are an integral part of many peoples lives around the world: they provede transportation to work and home, they cater to social lives, and for some they even provede a home.  However, it's becoming a trend to limit car usage, particularly in Europe. Residents in Vauban, Germany have given up cars almost completely, with the exception of a 40,000 parking garage fee that over half of the residents have elected not to use.  While it may make getting places harder, the effects of cutting down on car usage are mostly good ones.  First and foremost on this list is global warming. In Europe, cars produce around twelve percent of greenhouse emissions, while in the US, the number can be as high as fifty percent in cities. This is not good. Global warming is destroying the ice caps and the ozone layer of Earth, leading to a temperature increase that is damaging many environments around the world. This, in addition to pollution released by cars and the oil industry, could permanently cripple our planet. Any way that we can cut the effects of global warming should be implemented.  Secondly, crowded cities benefit in many ways from a lessening of driving. Some cities, like Paris, have already had to enact a partial ban on driving due to a heavy smog layer. Other cities, like Beijing, is even more polluted, and cities in this country suffer as well. If less people drove, the air would be clearer, as was the case in Paris.  Also, there is less crowding when less people are driving. Anyone who has driven through or lived in a large city knows just how bad congestion and traffic jams can be. Less driving would mean less congestion, making it easier for people to get to work, school, or other locations on time. When Paris enacted its driving ban of those with evennumbered licence plates, congestion went down sixty percent.  Finally, using an alternative to cars can save money.		0
The author supports this idea well and its about studying is Venus is a worthy pursuit. Even if there are some dangers to it they are not as big as to the reasons we should and without fixing the problems on why we can't. There are many reasons to studying Venus and visiting and its because there are possibilities that it could happen. Venus is the most like planet to earth but it'll just take time to get there. And we could go to Venus because it is the planet next to us and closer to the sun but then sometimes we do get closer to Mars depending on how it rotates but Vensu does have the most similarities to Earth.  The only thing is that we need to have the right spacecraft to make it to Venus and have it last because some don't last that long or they break. No spacraft has ever survived the landing longer than a few hours. But they want to know if the air in that planet is accessible to us to the point where there could possibly be life, or discover new things. Before Venus had was covered with ocean and could support life, but Venus today has some of those features, but are mostly a surface of a rocky sediment. But when wanting to go to Venus comes challenges because not everything is easy to do because the temperature there goes up to 800 degress fahrenhiet and the the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we expirience and the stuff in Venus are things that our body couldn't handle because we don't handle those type of things in Earth. But the author still wants to believe there could be away and will make sure there will be.  So i think there could be a chance to go to venus and i thik there should because it would be a good idea to discover new things and make new changes. If it's not now I know it will be later on in the future. The author made good points to why Venus is a worthy persuit dispite of the dangers that come with it. It is also a human curiosity to see what is really inside of Venus. the author says," Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limitted by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to me the very edges of imagination and innovation", and that's why he would want to do things out of his way even if it seems impossible.    		0
Dear Principal,  I feel that cleaning up the community is a good way to keep the community clean. It is a good idea to get the kids involved, but I don't feel that all the kids should have too. Some kids don't have the time and effort to do those kind of activities. For example, some kids might have to do an outside activity, like sports, and don't want to take time out of doing fun activities. Maybe they don't have enough time during the day to do even those things.  I am on a basketball team myself I don't have enough time after school to do my homework. Plus during my free time, I like to do things with my friends. If you want kids to be cleaning up the community, have the ones that volunteer. Sometimes cleaning up the community isn't such the best thing to do. A school shouldn't have to worry parents that their kids have to clean the community and be at a certain place at a certain time. parents should let their kids pick if they want to clean the community. Parents should teach to pick up after themselves, but not to clean others trash forcefully.  Some kids will want to clean a community. I say that you, as the principal, should take a vote on what to do. I'll just say that I don't have the time to clean the community, but others might, so let the kids decide. If they decide not to clean the community, then let the kids at school decide on what to do with the community and go from there. Don't take my advice, I am just an opinion. Just make sure to do what's right for the kids.		0
Hey, so for this essay, I'm gonna talk about how schools offering distance learning is a good or bad thing. Like, it's cool that we can learn from home and stuff, but it's also kinda hard to stay motivated.  So, one of the advantages of distance learning is that it's super convenient. Like, if I'm sick or something, I can just stay in bed and still learn. Or if it's raining outside, I don't have to worry about getting to school. It's like, really flexible. And I can learn at my own pace, which is nice 'cause some days I'm just not feeling it.  But, like, the thing is, it's hard to stay motivated when you're at home. Like, I might get distracted by my phone or TV, or my siblings might be being loud. And it's hard to communicate with teachers when you're not in a classroom. I might not get the help I need, or I might not understand something as well as I could if I was in a classroom.  Another thing is, distance learning can be kinda isolating. Like, I don't get to see my friends as much, and I might feel lonely or something. And it's hard to make new friends when you're not in a classroom.  But, like, some people might like distance learning 'cause they can learn in their pajamas or whatever. And they might be able to learn better 'cause they can focus more. And they can take breaks whenever they want, which is nice.  So, I don't know, I think distance learning is kinda complicated. It's got its pros and cons, you know? But I guess it's cool that schools are offering it as an option, 'cause it's good for some people. But I personally prefer going to school in person, 'cause I like seeing my friends and stuff.  Anyway, that's my essay. I hope you liked it. Let me know if you have any questions or something. Peace out!		1
**Driverless Cars: A Boon or a Bane?**  Driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize transportation, but there are also significant risks to consider. In this essay, I will argue that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the risks.  **Benefits of Driverless Cars**  There are a number of benefits to be gained from the development of driverless cars. First, driverless cars would eliminate the human factor in driving, which is responsible for a significant number of traffic accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), over 3 million people are injured and 30,000 people are killed in car accidents each year in the United States. Driverless cars could help to reduce these numbers by making roads safer.  Second, driverless cars would make travel more convenient. Drivers would no longer have to worry about the stress of driving, such as dealing with traffic, finding parking, or being tired behind the wheel. They could simply sit back and relax while their car took them to their destination. This would free up people's time and allow them to do other things, such as work, read, or socialize.  Third, driverless cars could help to reduce pollution. According to the EPA, transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Driverless cars could help to reduce emissions by driving more efficiently and avoiding traffic congestion.  **Risks of Driverless Cars**  There are also some risks associated with the development of driverless cars. One risk is that driverless cars could be hacked. If a hacker were able to gain control of a driverless car, they could potentially cause it to crash or to drive in a dangerous manner. This could pose a significant safety risk.  Another risk is that driverless cars could lead to job losses. As driverless cars become more common, there will be less need for human drivers. This could lead to job losses in the transportation industry.  **Conclusion**  In conclusion, the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the risks. Driverless cars have the potential to make roads safer, travel more convenient, and reduce pollution. However, there are also some risks associated with the development of driverless cars, such as the potential for hacking and job losses. It is important to weigh the benefits and risks carefully before making a decision about whether or not to support the development of driverless cars.		1
 Driverless cars are a topic that has been generating a lot of buzz in recent years. These fully autonomous vehicles have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel and improve road safety. In this essay, we will explore the benefits and challenges of driverless cars, and what the future might hold for this emerging technology.  One of the most significant benefits of driverless cars is the potential to greatly reduce the number of accidents on the road. Human error is a leading cause of traffic accidents, and autonomous vehicles have the potential to eliminate this factor entirely. With advanced sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence, driverless cars can detect and respond to potential hazards on the road in real-time, preventing accidents before they even occur.  Another benefit of driverless cars is increased mobility for those who are unable to drive. This includes the elderly, people with disabilities, and others who may not have access to a driver's license. Driverless cars could provide these individuals with the independence and freedom to travel when and where they choose.  However, there are also challenges associated with driverless cars. One of the biggest challenges is cost. Autonomous vehicles are currently very expensive to produce, and this cost is likely to be passed on to consumers. This could make driverless cars less accessible to the general public.  Another challenge is the potential for job losses. As driverless cars become more widespread, there may be a decrease in demand for jobs such as taxi drivers, truck drivers, and delivery drivers. This could have a significant impact on the economy, and it is important to consider the potential consequences of this shift in the job market.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to greatly improve road safety and increase mobility for those who are unable to drive. However, there are also challenges associated with this emerging technology, including cost and potential job losses. As we move forward, it will be important to carefully consider the benefits and challenges of driverless cars, and to develop policies that maximize the benefits while minimizing the risks. Overall, the future of driverless cars is exciting, and it will be interesting to see how this technology continues to develop in the coming years.		1
What is summer to you? Warm air, blistering sun, hot sandy beaches, cool ocean water, hanging out with friends, freedom, no responsibilities? Or is it the dreadful summer assignment you are forced to do by your calculus teacher? Summer is a time to have fun and enjoy a needed break from the monotonous and boring school routine, not a time to be doing more schoolwork for the next year. It is understandable, summer is too long to go without doing at least a little bit of learning, however, wouldn't it be much more bearable to do a summer project on something you actually want to learn about? Summer projects should be student-designed because they should be able to pursue something they enjoy, teachers won't be available for help, and more students would complete the assignment on time.  Many students in this world don't find a need for what they learn in high school when they find a job in the real world. Generally, many students struggle to find something they enjoy in a class in high school, but are still forced to take them, resulting in little time to explore what they are really passionate about. So why should students be forced to do boring projects on for classes they don't actually like over the summer, when they are supposed to be given a break to relax from school and have fun? It would be much more beneficial and enjoyable for students to explore their interests during a time they aren't stressed with other schoolwork. Giving the students the opportunity to choose what they work on for their summer assignment could help immensely with steering students towards the right career path by having them choose something that they personally find interesting.  Summer is also a time for the teachers to be given a break from school. During the school year, many teachers are working the five days during the week at the school, then grading over the weekends on their own time for no extra pay. Teachers embrace the long break and release of stress that comes with the hot air of summer just as much as the students do, and the last thing on their minds is the summer assignments they gave to all of their students. With many projects, especially ones as big as the ones given out for summer assignments, students need the support of their teachers to fully understand what they have to do, and with teachers out of action for the summer, they will have trouble understanding what is being assigned to them and may struggle completing the project. If students were able to choose what their project could be on, they would choose something that they understand better and wouldn't need the help and support of their teachers.  Although summer assignments are usually required and meant to be worked on over the course of the summer, many students push it off until the last week or just don't complete it at all because of how much they really dread doing the work. Many teenagers in general will do the things they enjoy until they absolutely have to do the things they don't want to do. If the summer project is on something they don't want to do, a large majority of students would push it off until late August to start, which defeats the purpose of having a summer assignment at all. If students were able to choose what they wanted to work on for their summer projects, they would be more encouraged and motivated to complete the assignment on time and work on it throughout the summer rather than waiting until the last minute.  Summer should be a period that students and teachers alike should look forward to as a time to relax and be free from the constant stresses of school. They should enjoy themselves in whichever way suits them during this time and should be doing the things they want to do, not what they are forced to do. By letting the students choose to focus on the things they enjoy, summer can be what everybody wants it to be, fun for everyone.		0
Productivity versus Idleness: A Comparative Analysis  Introduction  Productivity and idleness are two contrasting ways of life that can have significant impacts on a person's life and career opportunities. While productivity is often associated with success and recognition, idleness can lead to a lack of fulfillment and missed opportunities. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of both productivity and idleness, examine examples of successful people who have worked hard to gain recognition, and analyze the effects of idleness on a person's life and career opportunities.  Benefits of Productivity  Productivity is the state of being highly efficient and productive in one's work. It is often associated with success and recognition, as it allows individuals to accomplish more in less time. Productivity can lead to increased job satisfaction, higher salaries, and better career opportunities. For example, individuals who are productive and efficient in their work are often seen as valuable assets to their employers and are more likely to be promoted or given additional responsibilities.  Drawbacks of Idleness  Idleness, on the other hand, is the state of being unproductive and inactive. It can lead to a lack of fulfillment and missed opportunities. Idleness can also have negative impacts on a person's mental and physical health. For example, individuals who spend too much time sitting and not engaging in physical activity are at an increased risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health issues. Additionally, idleness can lead to feelings of boredom and dissatisfaction, which can negatively impact a person's overall well-being.  Examples of Successful People  There are many successful people who have worked hard to gain recognition. For example, Oprah Winfrey, one of the most successful media personalities of all time, rose from a poverty-stricken childhood to become a household name. Her success was due in large part to her hard work, determination, and productivity. Similarly, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has achieved incredible success through his hard work and dedication to his projects. Both Winfrey and Musk are examples of individuals who have worked hard to achieve success and recognition.  Effects of Idleness  Idleness can have significant negative effects on a person's life and career opportunities.		1
Do you think it is important to seek out advice from more than one person?  When found in a situation, many people ask others for their advice during the situation to very the outcome. If you ask more than one person for their advise or opinion on how to handle something, you will get multiple different answers. That should make the situation easier to handle, because you can see how it might end if you choose a certain way to deal with it. Someone you ask for advice from might have been in the same situation you are in, and can help you handle it. But you won't know if they have been in the same situation if you don't ask multiple people.  Asking multiple people for advice can, help you with a delimia, get you different opinions from different standpoints on a situation, and can make sure you are making a wise decision instead of an impulsive one.  You have a job at a retail marketing company as the social media manager, making 13 dollars and hour, have only been working for them for 4 months, and is only a 15 minute drive from your house. But there is another job offer, it is also a retail market company, but you would handle finances, and get paid 22 dollars an hour, and it is the next state over and is a 3 hour drive, you have all of your family here and just bought a house, your degree¬†is in¬†consumer finances. What do you do? You seek advice from a lot of people, get their opinions, see which one is better for you future, and make a decision off of the advice given to you. Remember, get multiple peoples' advice and opinions to make a wise decision instead of an impulsive one.		0
The Development of Driverless Cars   Driverless cars promise both benefits and risks for the future of transportation. While autonomous vehicles could help reduce traffic accidents and increase mobility, developing this new technology also presents serious safety and ethical concerns that must be addressed. On balance, I believe policymakers should support research into driverless cars but proceed cautiously before widespread adoption.  One of the primary benefits cited in the article is that driverless cars could reduce traffic accidents caused by human error. Without the risks of drunk, distracted or drowsy driving, autonomous vehicles may lower collision rates significantly. This safety advantage is compelling, as car accidents currently cause tens of thousands of deaths each year in many countries. By removing the human element of poor judgement from driving decisions, driverless vehicles could help curb these casualties.   However, the article also notes serious technical and ethical issues still to be resolved. Autonomous systems may struggle with unexpected hazards like construction zones or malfunctioning traffic lights. Software or sensors could malfunction in ways that cause accidents, as this technology is still in development. More concerning are ‚Äúedge cases ?where a computer must choose between outcomes like hitting a pedestrian or swerving into oncoming traffic‚Äîlife-or-death scenarios not easily programmed. Public fears over loss of control or hackable systems could also hamper acceptance and regulation.  While driverless cars show promise for improving transportation, the issues above indicate this technology requires further progress to become truly safe and socially beneficial on a mass scale. Rather than an outright ban or unrestricted adoption, policymakers should support continued research and pilots studies while enacting guidelines to protect users during development. With careful testing and standards that prioritize safety above all else, many of the risks identified in the article could be mitigated over time. Once autonomous vehicles can pass stringent, real-world certification without undue hazards, shifting policy to permit limited consumer use may become reasonable. Overall, a balanced approach seems wisest for responsibly guiding this influential new technology.  In conclusion, while driverless cars offer potential benefits, the challenges raised in developing autonomous vehicles warrant moderate policies that encourage research but proceed deliberately to resolve safety and ethical concerns before widespread adoption. Continued improvements and safeguards seem necessary to ensure this transformative technology ultimately provides more benefits than risks for public road users in the future.		1
If we were to limit our usage of our motor vehile's we'd salvage & try to repair our earth's polution problem. If we could switch over from using cars to bikes or any way of transportation not run on gas or anything that cause's damage to our O-zone , then i believe people would become healthier & more fit from the exercise of getting from one destination to another. Using motor vehicles is a lazy way of getting from place to place. but if we can comit to not using them or even just some days you dont drive then I believe we could help today's obieceity atleast a little bit.  If we could even limit driving in the big rural city's where everything is closer than in urban areas. I understand using motor vehicles to get from one far destination to another but their & back every single day is just destroying our earth. Polution is another effect driving does to the earth. In the German suburbs they have given up cars , people could learn some things about them. Their putting in effort to help save our earth from polution & other harmful things that come from driving so much for decades & decades.  I would love to live in a healthy & clean environment if we could work together to stop polution & damage to our O-zone perminantly. I love my life & would not want to end it any time soon. We were given life to enjoy ourselfs & be happy. Not to destroy oursleves along with it. Driving only causes polution & damage their are people that live in such poluted area's they cant leave their house because its bad that theyll get extremely sick. if we could chane that not only our world would be better but civilation as well.    		0
When your parents tell you to go clean your room, you most likely dont want to do it. But when you are put to the same task on your own time and rules, then you're more likely to do it. People like to be in control and have things to their benefit. When you're on vacation you dont want your professor telling you to do an assignment when it's your time off. Even if you must do the project, you would much rather have the project based on your needs than having the professor assign it based on his views. This is why summer projects that schools assign should be student designed.  When these projects during the summer are assigned, students should be interested in the topic of it. If it doesn't seek their interest, they will get lazy and procrastinate¬†since it is the summer time. Typically, students think of summer time as vacation and fun. For example, if a student is interested and passionate about sports but the teacher assigns a summer project about researching plants. Then the student will do a less efficient job on the project, thus resulting in the student not learning as much as they could've. Continuing to learn during break is the whole point of a summer project. So it's better that projects are student based to do it efficiently than to just half way do it and turn it in.  During the summer many kids are either working at jobs to earn money or on vacation somewhere. This is where student designed summer projects benefit the most. Since most students know their schedules and what they're capable of, then that means they can design projects that are flexible enough to work around their schedules to help them complete the assignment. Nobody wants to be in Hawaii with family having fun and then remembering that you have to do an assignment when maybe it's the only time you get to relax. Schools assign the summer projects to assure that students continue learning over the break, allowing students to design the project would be a great way to get students to take interest in the assignment and have time to do it.  Most people know what it's like to be a student in high school and college, the students get lazy and procrastinate on things. Having the summer project student based would increase what they learn about the subject and they would feel less forced to do it because they personally designed it and is to their benefit. It's like saying, would you rather buy someones shoe that they made or be able to make and design your own? Obviously you would prefer to be able to make your own shoe to make sure you have the colors and type of style that you like. The same goes with student designed projects over the summer. If you were to put yourself in a students point of view, you would want to be the one designing the project so you feel less forced to do it since you're the one that designed it.  However, some people may argue that summer projects should be teacher designed and not student designed. They say that because some people believe that the teacher knows best for the students because they are the ones that really know the material and subject. But by having teachers design the projects themselves, it could interfere with your job or schedule leaving you stressed out over the summer when you should be more relaxed. It is always very important to make sure that you get rest mentally and physically. The teacher could also leave an assignment that you have no clue or interest in, resulting in you not learning as well on the project as you could have. Student designed summer assignments have the benefits for both the teacher and student. The student will learn and have fun while doing the project, and the teacher doesn't have to worry about people not turning it in because the students will be interested in their project that they personally designed.  Overall,¬†By schools allowing summer projects to be student designed, more will get done while not feeling forced to do it. Many kids over the summer have jobs and by the students themselves designing the project, it will be more flexible around their schedule. Also this will allow the students to learn a lot more by being interested in the topic that they have chosen themselves. Then the teachers won't have to worry about people not turning it in or doing it last minute. This is why schools should make summer assignments student designed, based on the fact that it has more benefits to the teachers and the students.		0
Our principal has decided that all of us students must take at least one extracurricular activity. While other students may disagree with this rule I strongly agree with this new decision. This new rule can help students later on with life skills or just finding their passion. The new rule can also help the school with task such as making the yearbook and making sales.  My first reason I agree with this decision is that students can use the skills from their classes later on. If you take a language class it can help with communication to other people that dont speak English. If you want to work on computers when you get older taking a computer class can help. Using skills from the classes you take can help later for jobs when you are no longer in school.  My second reason I agree with this decision is that taking these extracurricular classes can help a student discover a new hobby of theirs. At first you may not like your new extracurricular class but later on the class may become fun to do and maybe even your favorite class. I know this because I used to hate programming in computer class but now I find it very fun to do!  My third and final reason I agree with this decision is that it can help the school. If the school doesn't have a yearbook team the teachers have to make it together and that can take forever. With a team of yearbook students they can interview people for quotes, surveys for the yearbook, and make it look better overall. Another activity is sports and with sports you can do sales and make extra money for the school by selling tickets for games and food. Without a school sports team some fund raising¬†money would be lost for things the school needs like new equipment or supplies for students.		0
 First impressions are often seen as set in stone, with little room for change. However, I believe that this is a misconception. While first impressions can be difficult to alter, they are not impossible to change. In fact, with effort and awareness, individuals can work to overcome negative first impressions and form more positive ones.  One of the reasons why first impressions can be difficult to change is because they are often based on superficial factors. For example, someone may make a negative first impression based on a person's appearance, body language, or accent. However, these factors may not accurately reflect a person's true character or personality. By recognizing that first impressions are often based on superficial factors, individuals can work to overcome negative first impressions by getting to know the person on a deeper level.  Additionally, first impressions can be influenced by a person's own biases and prejudices. For example, someone may make a negative first impression of someone based on their race or ethnicity, without even realizing it. By becoming aware of their own biases and working to overcome them, individuals can work to form more positive first impressions.  In my experience, I have seen first impressions change over time. For example, when I first met someone at a party, I may have formed a negative first impression based on their appearance or behavior. However, as I got to know them better, I may have discovered that they were actually very kind and caring individuals. By recognizing that first impressions can change over time, individuals can work to overcome negative first impressions and form more positive ones.  In conclusion, while first impressions can be difficult to change, they are not impossible. By recognizing that first impressions are often based on superficial factors and can be influenced by biases and prejudices, individuals can work to overcome negative first impressions and form more positive ones. With effort and awareness, individuals can create a more positive and inclusive environment for themselves and others.		1
Gathering multiple opinions helps people make better choices by giving them multiple viewpoints. These new viewpoints can give them various new way to approach the decision. By having multiple ways to approach the problem, you can choose the best one and make the best decision.  Asking someone for advice can make you realize an option that you haven't thought of yet. Sometimes you think that you can only choose one of two or three options. However, when you ask someone else for advice, they might notice an option that you hadn't noticed that's even better. One time I had a track meet on my friends birthday. I wanted to go to his birthday party and celebrate with him, but my team really needed me to run the mile event because I had the fastest mile time out of the team. I asked my coach if it would be okay if I missed the meet, then he told me that I could just run the mile and then leave afterward. I hadn't thought of that because usually, everyone runs all the events just to give each team a better chance at the fastest time. So decided to leave early for my friend's party. I ended up¬†winning the mile event, and then having a great time at my friend's party. Not only does asking for advice give you new options, but it can help you think through your existing options more thoroughly.  Another reason to gather different viewpoints is other people might view the decision in a different way. By gaining a different viewpoint of the decision, you could notice new pros and cons that you hadn't thought of for each option. At the beginning of this year I was deciding whether or not I wanted to apply for Generic_School. When I was deciding if I wanted to apply, I was mostly thinking about how hard to application process would be. Only really intelligent people get into Generic_School, and I wasn't sure if I had a good enough chance of getting in. I focused mostly on whether or not I was going to make it in, and if the probability of me getting in was worth the effort. When I asked my dad for advice he said "do you even want to go to Generic_School?" He told me that going to Generic_School was really stressful and time consuming, and many of the people there spend almost all of there time studying and doing work. Those were things that I had not considered before. I realized that Generic_School wasn't for me, so I ended up not applying. The different viewpoints that you get, can come from other experiences, and be applied to your own.  Other people can sometime give you advice because have gone through a similar choice. If you ask someone for advice, they may be able to take something they learned from a choice they had to make. You can apply that to the decision that you need to make. When I was in fifth grade, I was in my last year of Cub Scouts and I was getting ready to cross over into Boy Scouts. I had to choose what Boy Scout troop I wanted to cross over to. I couldn't decide on which one I wanted to go to, so I asked my great uncle, who was a very successful scout, how he decided which troop he wanted to join. He told me to "find a group of scouts that I would enjoy sharing a meal or a tent with, because if you have that, your time in scouting will be much more enjoyable." That advice led me to Generic_Name, they were all really nice people, so I ended up joining their troop. Four years later I'm still enjoying Boy Scouts, I've gone on dozens of camping trips, and made some of my best friends. Asking my great uncle for advice was really helpful in that situation.  Asking people for advice is very important, because hearing other viewpoints can give us a new way of thinking about the decision we have to make. The next time you have to make an important choice, try asking people you trust for advice.		0
I disagree with the principal because, not everyone wants to do an extracurricular activity such as sports or clubs. firstly, if your disabled in any kind of way you will feel left out because you don't have as many options as the other kids without disabilities because if you were born without a limb you most likely wouldn't be in the sporting scene any time soon. the truth is the coaches will usually pay more attention to a strong person with all limbs and no disablilities rather than a kid walking on one leg trying to try out for the sport. which is very discriminative of the kids like that so, this soon to be plan should be cancellled before it ever cpomes to action it will cause so much sadness and despair thats not really worth it.  Secondly, mentally being prepared for having to do all of that stuff, it could really wreck your mental state trying to do better and better but then your club or sports team looks down upon you for not being able to compete with them. so if the principal does go through with this plan he will have to hire more guidance councelors to help all the kids be in better mental state which he didn't say he would do. im thinking this will just wreck more kids physdically and mentally by being exausted all the time with even more school work than before because now you have an extra class or sport to worry about and on top of that its mandatory. if i was in the situation honestly i'd want to be homeschooled so don't have to go through so much teasing and hatred being thrown at me for not being as good as the other kids at the sport or club im in.  Third, sociality, this can wreck a person or it could help them i think being in a specific club or sport that people say is weak or weird will make people get bullied more by other students because they want to do something they enjoy but everyone else will just bully them for it. say if somebody created a club called superhero club where kids wouild dress up like superheros for that class personally i'd look down upon those kids because that seems pretty weird they would get bullied for it even though they find it fun and funny because thats jsut the way society works. its pretty unfortunate but the guidance councelors i talked about earlier could help try and stop the bullying but it probably wont stop that easily. but if I made a club called sports club everyone in that ckub will be looked at like normal people evn if they paint their face strange colors and wear random peoples jerseys they will still be looked at as "cool."  Fourthly, personality, because if your more nerdy but want to join the sports club you will be swiftly declined even if your good at sports because the people will just look at you for your reputation, the way you dress and your personalitity. most of the time rather thna not the mean and evil peole will succeed in school reputation but if your a nice person usually people just won't know who you are or just thinks their a weirdo which does suck beacause unfortunately the mean and evil people get hyped up to becoome a bully then the nice kids do something horrible. which is unfortunate to say the least, but there is one way to change it tell a teacher or a parent about whats happening to avert a crisis if the bullying still doesen't stop and the bully starts assualtimng or hitting you for not being mean like them you can contact the police about the issue and it will be solved real quick. their is another reason why people get bullied and those kids that get bullied commit a crime or something worse, because everyuone will call you a "snitch" even though what you did literally could have saved your life by informing a parent, teacher or the police about the misshap.  Finally, religion, if your christian you won't get bullied ever and if you somehow do, its probably because your not in america. but if your muslim wearing those turbans and stuff you will be sterotyped a lot and people will probably try and pull it off of you because it looks kind of strange. also if you believ in the chinese religions people i n school and out of school will usually say things to make you mad like ching chong min mong even though none of that is chinese. because people just look for something or someone to make miserable to make themselves feel wanted and dominant over the other person like a god or something because those people or the "bullies" will ruin your life for anything sometimes religion. also if you belive in a certain thing like god then people will look at you as normal or chill but if you believe in a another giod like budha peole will make a lot of jokes about budha and you because they find it funny in a mean way.		0
One Club  Parents and other people think it is good to have extracurricular activity for kids. People say that it helps kids interact with other kids. People also say that it takes time away from them going on their phone. I also agree that every kid should have to take one. You are not taking five or six it is just one. I think this would be a great thing to do. It would help kids find, or improve there hobbies. A hobby is some thing you like to do. Hobbies are cool and there are a lot of your hobbies at school in the from of after school activity. They even can fit the your week. You can even find friends that like the same thing you do. There are clubs that are just certain grades.  Clubs are on every day of the week. Like how on Mondays kids go to running club, or on Thursday kids go to drama club. Kids do all sorts of cool clubs. Clubs are made to be on all sort of days Monday, Tuesday, Wensday, Thursday, and Friday. There are a bunch of clubs here are some. You have running club, drama, lacrosse, chess, girl scouts, yearbook, vex, knitting, battle of the books. You see that is just some of them. Maybe you should try one?  There other good thing about having extracurricular activity. Maybe you will meet someone that likes what you like, and you guys or girls will be friends. You could also have a better relationship with the teacher who teaches the club. I could see you thinking but if there are little kids, and they can be a little annoying. If you ask but what if the older kids run me over. Then there is a place for you because there are clubs that are just older or younger kids.  I think it would be great to have every person to do one extracurricular activity. There are many factors that they are good. Like they can fit your week, there are a lot¬†of club to pick from, meet new friends,and last but not least there are age clubs too.		0
 Using Facial Action Coding System technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could potentially provide some benefits, but it also raises significant privacy concerns that make its overall value questionable.   On one hand, this technology may help teachers gain insights into how their students are responding to lessons on an individual level. By detecting if students appear bored, confused, or engaged as class is ongoing, teachers could potentially make adjustments to improve instruction. This level of emotion detection could help ensure more students understand content and stay motivated to learn. The technology may also flag if a particular student seems distressed, allowing a teacher to check in on their wellbeing.  However, continuously monitoring students' facial expressions without their consent crosses an ethical line. Classrooms are meant to be safe, inclusive environments for learning, not testing grounds for experimental technologies. Students should feel free to naturally express a range of emotions‚Äîincluding frustration with difficult concepts‚Äîwithout being subjected to computerized emotion surveillance. Even if data is supposedly anonymous, many students could still feel self-conscious under such monitoring, undermining their comfort at school.   There are also concerns about accuracy and potential misinterpretation of data. Facial expression analysis is an imperfect science, so computers meant to detect emotions may misclassify students' responses. Teachers relying on this flawed data risk making incorrect assumptions about how students are processing lessons. Students could end up being unfairly judged or perceived in a way that does not truly reflect their experiences in class.   Overall, while emotion detection technology hints at possible benefits, its application in classrooms raises serious problems related to student privacy, consent, and data reliability that are not easily solved. Unless such issues can be addressed through transparent safeguards that prioritize student well-being over experimental uses of technology, this surveillance threatens more harm than good to the learning environment. While the goals of insight into teaching and learning are worthwhile, this particular approach appears premature and potentially damaging without major changes.		1
 The question of whether we choose our own character traits or if they are formed by influences beyond our control is a complex one. On the one hand, some people believe that our character is largely determined by our upbringing, genetics, and life experiences. On the other hand, others argue that we have the power to shape our own character through our choices and actions. In my opinion, I believe that we need to choose our own character traits.  Firstly, when we choose our own character, we are able to align our actions with our values and beliefs. This allows us to live a life that is authentic and meaningful to us. For example, if we choose to be honest and trustworthy, we will be able to build strong relationships with others and earn their respect. On the other hand, if we choose to be dishonest or deceitful, we may damage our relationships and harm others.  Secondly, when we choose our own character, we are able to take responsibility for our actions and the consequences that come with them. This allows us to learn from our mistakes and grow as individuals. For example, if we choose to be responsible and accountable, we will be able to take ownership of our actions and learn from them. On the other hand, if we choose to blame others or shift responsibility, we may not learn from our mistakes and may repeat them in the future.  Finally, when we choose our own character, we are able to live a life that is fulfilling and satisfying. This allows us to achieve our goals and aspirations. For example, if we choose to pursue our passions and interests, we will be able to live a life that is meaningful and fulfilling. On the other hand, if we choose to live a life that is not aligned with our values and beliefs, we may feel unfulfilled and unsatisfied.  In conclusion, I believe that we need to choose our own character traits in order to live a life that is authentic, meaningful, and fulfilling. By aligning our actions with our values and beliefs, taking responsibility for our actions, and pursuing our passions and interests, we can shape our own character and live a life that is truly ours.		1
Dear Principal,  I think cell phones should be allowed in school but not during class. Policy one is the one i agree with for many reasons. One reason is that phones can be a way for education. Now phones can go on the internet, and check your email. If the teacher asked for a certain thing in school and next hour was lunch. He/She would be able to go on the internet on their phone and find the information. Cell phones can also be a way to communicate if u need help in spare time. You could call up your friend and ask them for help if they are maybe in a different class. When the phones are off in class they do not create a disturbance to other people. So they do not get their cell phones taken away. It also can just help them if they needed a ride home because something came up. If you needed to stay after school for example, you could call your parents or a friend during lunch or spare time and then nothing to worry about. That is why I think cell phones should be allowed in school, but only during lunch or spare time.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
In my opinion, I think that the Electoral College method should be abolished, because with it the Presidential elections are quite useless. I'm specifically talking about the way Presidents get popular votes. The system is very outdated and very irrational. When the Founding fathers founded this country, they said that the "People of America" get a voice and say in everything, well, not everything. But still their own say during the presidential Elections are useless, the only real true thing to do is vote for the Senate Electors for the Presidential elections since the Electoral College process is mainly controlled by the Senate, the Senators vote for the Presidential candidate. You see, the only way candidates actually win the every 4 year elections in November is by the amount of votes they get, by NOT the people, but by the Senators that pledged with them during the Electoral College. In this essay I'll explain why this system is to bad for our today's world and how it can lead to false moves and corruption.  First off, is what's exactly the Electoral College? It's not a place, it's more like a process of choosing and voting for a Presidential candidate. You see the votes that regular U.S citizens do, do not count as the actual votes, though back then the system did work it doesn't today. Back then around the 18th and mid 19th century, this Electoral College system worked outstanding for it's time, mainly because at first America was a new country, and the Senate that did do the voting and choosing were well educated and have experience. Most citizens in the American States weren't really that educated very well, mostly for new borns since the nation just finished their revolution and they were still in debt at the time, and so not everybody was rich enough to afford anything, in turn they have no knowledge of the way the world now works. Then during the civil war, half the country became another country known as the confederate States of America, which opposed the ideals of a more freer nation of other half of the country, known as the United States of America. The Electoral College did help President Abe to be elected, though it was mainly because he was popular since he used the ideal of abolishing and freeing slaves to gain populraity. And alot of people opposed him to become President, but thanks to the College process he won the Elections, and reunited the two nations into the United States of America.  So, does this will in today's world? No, abosolutely not, it doesn't work, and will never work unless America gets 1984'ed and become a false and brainwashed Utopia. Due to our general corrupt society, the right President's get denied, and the corrupt and wrongful citizen gets elected. I can relate this issue with the 2000 Presidential Election crisis. In the 2000 elections, Al Gore gets the most popular votes, infact so much more then George Bush, that it was clear he can easily win the 2004 elections. But since the Electoral College is still intact, they voted for George Bush, and Bush won the elections by 5 more votes then the popular and better organized President, Al Gore. Because of this, most of America got an economy train wreck from in 20072008 and also wasted many resources on a the War on Terror battle from 2003, which is now gone and has a similar operation that is still ongoing called Operation Enduring Freedom. Also unlike the old times when America was a new country, in today's modern 21st Century America, I can assure you that we have 95% percent of the Population educated by our today's educational standards tops. Which means that America doesn't need a hand when voting for a new President, and that shows that the Electoral College is not needed anymore, anytime. The Governments and it's people today are also very corrupt at times. This will also include the Electoral College, and can affect many lives for many people. Everybody can now make their own choice thanks to our very effective education system. So this proves the College group is now useless for voting.  Finally that's why we should abolish like Bob Dole said, it can cause a lots of corruption, and was only made for it's time since at that time many people were uneducated and couldn't even read, and now a day's today's society is very well off on educated minds. And has enough corruption as it is. And so that's the nutshell of this essay, and this is why we should remove the Electoral College. As its unfair and unfit for today's world and society of the American Government.		0
I think that limiting car usage is great for the environment. There are a lot of benefits that come from it. If we use car less then greenhouse gas emissions will decrease and thus cleaning the air of smog. Some of the benefits that limiting car use is that: 1. it decreases poisonous smog, 2. lots of cities in the world are doing it, 3. and last but not least it could promote other ways of travel. Its about time that the world start changing some harmful habits.  To start of, Reducing car use is very effective when trying to get rid of smog. In some cities such as Paris, smog is a big pollution there. In Paris they even went head to head with Beijing,China which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of this globally known city. by enforcing this, some days cars with even numbered license plate could drive. The next day odd numbered cars could drive. If you were caught then you were fined. so by paris doing this congestion was down a whopping 60% in Paris after just 5 days.  This would cut down greenhouse effects tremendously. So far reducing car use sounds pretty good.  Furthermore Paris isnt the only place in the world to do this. Bogota,Colombia in a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians either hiked, bike, skated, or took a bus to commute around the country to their destination. This is known as a car free day. This carfree day left the streets of the capitol void and empty of rush hour traffic. Even the U.S. government is considering the international event that is also helping the environment at the same time.  Another thing to reduce greenhouse gas is if people would find a more alternative way of transportation. City buses could count as an alternative,because think if a bus could seat 30 people. Think if all 30 people had their own car, then the emission amout would substantialy increase 30 vehicles rather than 1 vehicle. Other ways of transportation are things such as bikes, skatesskateboard, or just walking. none of those alternatives release any type of emissions.  In a way not using cars sounds great in many ways,but there are those people out there that rely on the usage of cars to transport themselves such as anyone with physical handicaps. Maybe this is the start of something new but what happens to this earth is all on us so it what we dicide to do with it rather we wont it to last or we can just let it go and lose the one planet we have left.		0
"The Face" on Mars has brought up alot of attention. People are debating whether or not it is real or fake. There are two sides to the argument. Is it a sign of aliens or civilization, or is it just a natural landform on Mars? Some people even say is it even a face at all. Let's find out what it really is.  The face can be argued as a landform or something that an ancient civilation made. We as a whole, NASA, have confirmed it is a natural landform found on Mars, a mesa. Mesas are actually quite common in the American West according to the article. There has been no signs that an ancient civilization has lived on Mars, so it is highly unlikely that the face could've been built by aliens. Although it is possible, it is highly unlikely.  If there was alien life on Mars, we (NASA) wouldn't deny it, because all it would do is bring us more money and more exploration to do. If there would be one sign of ancient civilization on Mars, then that might just mean that it could or once did support life. We have checked to make sure that there is signs of life on and near the face by taking multiple pictures like the pictures in 1976, 1998, and in 2001. Some said that alien markings were hidden by haze but we have proven them wrong as seen from the pictures.  In conclusion, "The Face" that has been argued about is just a natural landform called a mesa. It is not alien made, it is natural. Although it is possible for aliens to have created something on Mars, we have not found any signs of alien life capable of making such things. So for now, there is no signs of aliens that we know of yet. But once we do find a sign, you better bet that we, NASA, will tell as soon as possible.        		0
People do use their cell phones on a daily basis but they shouldn't use their phones when they are driving. When you are driving and texting you can cause a car crash or something worse. The only time you should have your phone while your driving is if you have a hands free mode. It is better to not text while driving you see some people like to text while they are driving so their not paying any attention to the road and to what's in front of them.  That will cause them to get into the following accidents: car crash, running someone over, or going off the road. These accidents have happened before including if there is a kid riding with you. It will also cause meager injures to the drive and the passengers even the kid. That is why we create cars that have a free hand mode so that way you call or text someone without looking at the phone. They even have phone holders that you can attach to the fane of your car.  For example I am a person who is always on my phone everyday. One day I am driving my kids to their friends house but then I get a text message from my friend. I pick up the phone and I read the text that means i'm paying more attention to my phone and not to the road. At that moment when I'm reapplying to his text suddenly a car pulls up and I try to slam on the brakes but then I crash into the car. I am very injured from the crash and my kids are also in pain that is what happens when you are texting and driving.  99% of people have gotten into this kind of accident all because they were texting and driving at the sametime. If we all didn't have are phones when we are driving we could avoid these accidents and be safe. Even Some people who are texting and driving can even cause death to a person because they got ran over by a car. Phones are a distraction when you are driving because it claimed up to 3,450 live back in 2016 alone and it still is. It also caused 391,000 injured people in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers in 2015.  Teens are the largest age group reported as distracted at the time of fatal crashes when texting. Back in 2013 about 1.2 million of car crashes have occurred all because of cell phones usage while driving statistics that had shown that this kind of behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. Texting while driving statistics show that doing this behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. That is why when people are behind the wheel they shouldn't have there phone when driving.   		0
Dear Senator,   I am writing to share my perspective on whether the United States should keep the current Electoral College system or change to a popular vote for electing the President. After reviewing arguments on both sides of this issue, I believe the Electoral College should be maintained.  One advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in a wider array of states. If we moved to a popular vote, candidates would likely focus all of their attention on highly populated urban areas. This could disenfranchise voters in rural states. The Electoral College system gives citizens in smaller states a louder voice and encourages candidates to consider the needs of all regions of the country.   Some argue this is unfair and that the candidate with the most total votes nationwide should win. However, switching to a popular vote could actually discourage voter turnout. Citizens in states that heavily favor one party may feel their votes do not really matter or change the outcome. The Electoral College gives more voters in more states a feeling that their votes are meaningful and could influence the election. It helps motivate high voter participation.  It is also worth considering that the Founding Fathers established the Electoral College system as a compromise between election by Congress and nationwide popular vote. It was a deliberate decision based on concerns about direct democracy and mob rule. While the current system may not be perfect, changing it could have unintended consequences and weaken the federal character of the presidential election process. On balance, maintaining the Electoral College appears to best uphold bipartisan values of equality, participation and political stability.  In conclusion, I believe the advantages of the current Electoral College system outweigh arguments for switching to a popular vote. It has generally worked well for over two centuries and helps ensure all citizens have a meaningful say in choosing the nation's president. I hope you will support keeping the Electoral College as we have known it. Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Sincerely, [Your name]		1
When I was a little girl my mom always used to say this quote "  Never trust just one person  ". I never could really understand the meaning behind this quote, till a event in my life changed everything. Were I ended up getting hurt because of the advice one person gave to me. This quote means even if you trust one person with everything always ask for a second opinion. When one is trying to get good advice ask more then one person your able to see all the outcomes, find what works best for you, and sometime people just tell you thing to benefit them self.  When a person has a problem it is good to know all of the out comes as a result of what will happen. Consulting in more them one person your able to get different ways to fix the situation. Sure you may think you only need one person to help you get through everything but what happens if there opinion gets you in a lot¬†of trouble. What is one going to do from there if you dont ask others for what they think. For example if you robed a bank, you ask your best friend what they would do they say keep the money and when you get caught you would get in big trouble. If you ask someone else like your parents they would say just tell the truth and not get in as much trouble. There are always more then one solution also it depend on who gives you the advice.  When asking more then one for what they think is best your able to find what best fits for you. Wouldn't you want to solve the problem with out getting as hurt or in trouble. We all know that there is always a easy way out but is it the best option. Seeking multiple opinions will give you the chance to find  For a instance you got in a fight with your best friend, so you go ask your other friends what to do one said make it up and others say make her say sorry first. After hearing this sure making her say sorry is easier but is it the right way to go. Its always better to just find what you think is right even if it is a little harder.  In this word we live in today one day your best friend can say "omg we will be friend forever" but at the end they say things to you that only benefit them self. Have this ever happen to you? It happened to me before, when I was little I was best friends with this girl. I asked her what her opinion¬†on what I should were to the school dance, she told me to get this really ugly dress because of that i got laughed at and she be came popular. If I asked someone else I am pretty sure I wouldn't have been humiliated. In the 20 first century most people now only care for there well being and not anyone else.  Looking for the right answers maybe hard sometimes, you maybe not like the outcome. Even if you think that one people knows the answer just to make sure get others opinions¬†on it. Dont be scared to ask what is the worst that can happen. At the end just do what you believe is right, peoples opinions are what they think it is only suppose to help guide but you have to make the final decision¬†¬†		0
  Dear [State Senator],  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. After reading and analyzing various sources, including "Does the Electoral College Work?" by the Office of the Federal Register, "The Indefensible Electoral College" by Bradford Plumer, and "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to Keep Our Despised Method of Choosing the President" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I have come to the conclusion that the Electoral College is a fair and effective system for electing the President.  One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a clear winner in the presidential election. Unlike a popular vote system, where a candidate could win an election with a plurality of votes but still lose the presidency, the Electoral College requires a candidate to receive a majority of votes (270 out of 538) to win the presidency. This helps to prevent political polarization and guarantees that the President will have the support of a broad coalition of states. As Judge Posner argues, "a victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does" (Posner). This helps to ensure that smaller states have a voice in the election process.  Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign across the country, rather than just focusing on heavily populated areas. As Bradford Plumer argues, "it is highly unlikely that a candidate will win the presidency without winning the majority of the electoral votes" (Plumer). This means that candidates must appeal to voters in a wide		1
Luke bomberger was just a normal high school graduate, Until his friend Don Reist asked him to go with him to Europe on a cattle boat. He was just given the opportunity of a lifetime. Luke and his friend Don had reasons to sign up for being a " Seagoing cowboy". World war II had now ended and many countries were left destroyed, to help the countries recover from war they will need things such as food, animals, and many other things. To help the people in those countries 44 nations united to form a group called UNRRA ( the united nations relief and rehabilitation administration). The " Seagoing Cowboys" were hired to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. In August 1945, they got orders to report to New Orleans. Luke and his friend arrived on August 14th, the same day the Pacific war ended. There was 335 horses to take care of. Before arriving in Greece Luke turned 18, which means that he is now eligable to be drafted for the military service. In 1947 Luke had made nine trips, more than any seagoing cowboy. Luke ended up touring many places around the world. Luke was doing his job chcking on the animals, but this time was different it was raining, Luke accidentally slid down a ladder and almost fell into the deep dark ocean but a piece of metal stopped him fromm falling. Luke was lucky to be alive but he still was injured with some cracked ribs. Although it wasn't always fun, Luke found things to do like baseball, volleyball, tennis, and many more things. Luke had an amazing adventure being a Seagoing Cowboy, he discovered the world and was given a once in a lifetime opportunity.		0
  Dear [State Senator's Name],  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen and student, I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and unfair system that should be abolished in favor of a direct popular vote.  One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a more representative election by giving more weight to votes from swing states. However, as Bradford Plumer argues in his article "The Indefensible Electoral College," this system can lead to a situation where a candidate wins the presidency without receiving the most popular votes. This happened in the 2000 election when Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election due to the Electoral College system. This is an unfair scenario that undermines the democratic principles of the United States.  Another argument against the Electoral College is that it disproportionately represents the interests of smaller states. As Judge Richard A. Posner notes in his article "In Defense of the Electoral College," the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on toss-up states, which are often larger states. This means that voters in smaller states have less influence on the election outcome, which is unfair and undemocratic.  Furthermore, the Electoral College system can lead to a tie in the Electoral College, which would result in the House of Representatives choosing the president. As Posner argues, this would be a catastrophic scenario that would undermine the democratic process.  On the other hand, some argue that the Electoral College ensures that a presidential candidate must		1
Wow! What a surpise, a new breakthrough of technology. This technology is known as the Facial Action Coing System. This system identifies human emotions. In this essay I will tell you why I think that this system is valuable. There are three main reasons why it is in such of value to us. One, it can help bring the truth out in people. Two, it can people get help if they always come to class with a sadness emotion on their face. Third, is that it can help with lessons being taught.  First, which is bringing the truth out of people. Now, I think this is valuable, not just to the classroom, but in the real world. This valuable in the classroom because it can identify whether a student is lying or telling the truth to his or her teacher at the time. This is essential because it goes along with my reason of that this technology helps with the lesson. This can help interpret if the student or students, are lying if you say if they know what is going on, and not confused.  Secondly, is that you will be able tell if a student or students are upset or not. I feel like this is important because it can be hard for the student(s) to concentrate on the lesson if they are too busy thinking about why they are upset. With the right attitude the teacher can help the student(s) get their education. Another reason why this is important because it can save lives of people that suffering from depression. This can help lower the amount of deaths in a year because it can help recognize that a student may need some psychological help. For example, in the passage it says,"...the software can identify mixed emotions."This is important because it can tell what you are feeling inside. The teacher can maybe help the people cheer up and get on with the day's lesson.  Third, is that it can help with the lesson. Now this is very essential because it can help determine if the students are confused or bored. This is important because some students may be afraid to be one of the only ones to be confused of the subject. This is something o be recognized because it o decide to continue with the lesson or to move on to a different one of interest. As said in the passage,"A classroom computer could recognize when a studetn is bored or confused."Also said,"Then, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."These quotes help get my point across because it shows that it can help recognize if the student is in a place of boredom or dispair.  In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in classrooms because it can help makes the teacher's job easier. Which can also help the students by, it recognizing if somone is being truthful , to help notice if a student may be upset for some odd reason, and that it can help the teacher know if the lesson that they previously just did needs some more work, or if he or she can move forward on to a different lesson.              		0
I agree with having students do extracurricular activities after school, I feel like it would be a good idea to have not every student but, students that will participate involved in some of the extracurricular activities. This could help the students that get into bad things outside of school do better for themselves.  I feel that the students would have fun and would enjoy their¬†time doing the activities provided for them. I agree with students participating in extracurricular activities but, I don't think every student should be involved in the activities for the simple fact, all students do not participate in the activities, in my opinion the activities the principal is providing for the students should be a privilege.  I think one of the activities should be homework club, for the students that need to catch up on work that is pass due or things the students may need help on. Without good grades us students shouldn't be able to have the privilege to be participating in the fun things until our grades are better.  We should have different things for the activities so everyone can try new things, in case¬†they never seen it or tried it and end up liking one of the activities provided.  Another reason i agree is that, some of the students like being after school instead of going home or maybe the students that are going through things at home can stay and do the activities and have fun, I have a list of things that i think would be good activities for students such as basketball football step team/dance team music/rap/sing band practice soccer softball/baseball acting  The activities should be a fun experience but also a learning experience, the students should have fun and learn from it as the have fun doing the activities. Hopefully the extracurricular activities should have the students more active, productive, engaged, and more than happy to stay for more activities.		0
Ummm, hey there!  So, umm, for this essay, I gotta talk about this quote by Winston Churchill, right?  Like, it's pretty deep, ya know? He's saying that success is all about, like, failing and stuff, but still being excited about it.   So, like, I think he's saying that failure is actually a good thing. Like, it's not the end of the world when you don't get something right away. It's like, a stepping stone to success.  You gotta keep trying, even when things don't go your way.   I mean, think about it. Like, if you never failed at anything, you wouldn't learn anything. You wouldn't know what you're good at or what you need to work on.  It's like, you gotta take risks and try new things, even if you're gonna mess up sometimes.   And it's not just about learning stuff, either.  Like, failing can also be, like, a cool story to tell later.  You know, like, "Hey, I tried this crazy thing and it didn't work out, but I learned so much from it!"  People will be like, "Wow, that's really cool! You're so brave!"   But, like, the most important thing is that you don't lose enthusiasm.  Even when you're failing, you gotta keep that excitement and passion for what you're doing.  It's like, if you don't, then you'll never reach your goals.   So, yeah, I guess what I'm saying is that failure is not the end of the world.  It's actually a pretty important part of the journey to success.  Just gotta keep at it and don't lose that enthusiasm, you know?   Anyway, that's		1
[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP] [Email Address] [Phone Number] [Date]  [Senator's Name] [Address] [City, State, ZIP]  Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],  I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in place for the election of the President of the United States. While many argue for a shift towards a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should be considered.  First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. This minimizes the likelihood of disputed election results, as seen in the 2000 election between Al Gore and George W. Bush. The Electoral College provides a clear and decisive path to victory, which is crucial for maintaining a stable democracy.  Additionally, the Electoral College promotes representation for all regions of the country. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must have trans-regional appeal to win the presidency. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on regions where they have the most support, ensuring that the president will have broad-based support and take into account the interests of all Americans. It also prevents candidates from ignoring states with smaller populations, as the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes gives even small states some weight in the election.  The Electoral College also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the outcome of the election is less certain. This means that voters in these states, who are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, have a greater influence on the outcome of the election. It encourages candidates to engage with voters directly and tailor their policies to address the concerns of these swing states. By doing so, the Electoral College ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, have a say in deciding the election.  Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of large and small states in the political process. While the mal-apportionment of the Senate may give smaller states more influence, the Electoral College ensures that large states receive more attention from presidential candidates. This means that candidates must consider the concerns and interests of both large and small states, maintaining a balance of power and preventing one group from dominating the decision-making process.  Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complications of run-off elections. When no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, run-off elections may be necessary. The Electoral College reduces the likelihood of this scenario by invariably producing a clear winner. This streamlines the election process and allows for a smooth transition of power.  In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides several important benefits that should not be overlooked. It ensures a certainty of outcome, promotes regional representation, encourages campaigning in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While there may be arguments in favor of a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College remains the best method for electing the President of the United States.  Thank you for considering my perspective on this issue. I trust that you will take into account the diverse viewpoints and interests of your constituents when making decisions that affect our democracy.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1

Sick of driving for long hours when attending places? Hate getting tickets for speeding or missing roads signs? For heaven sakes sometimes when driving legs, fingers, or other body parts can cramp up! Say good-bye to cars that require to have a human driver at all times, and say aloha to driverless cars! Driverless cars have pros like GPS navigation and they provide more safety for the people, but cons such as weather conditions or technical errors.  For the old folks, looking back into history television and cell phones were major and exciting changes. So now the young generation wonders what the next big thing will be. Driverless cars will perhaps be the next big thing? To me this is a fabulous and efficient idea! Personally, I dont know how many times someone has asked me for directions. My headache finally has come to an end! With driverless cars there is a built in GPS reciever using google if I recall back to the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming." Nobody will ever need help on how to get somewhere. Just tell them the place and time and the cars will get you there possibly without a humans help the whole car ride.  "Safety first!" is what they say now days. Watch for road signs and don't run the stop sign is commonly heard. Sometimes, when you go out late at night to a party, you have to watch for drunk drivers and be aware. Driverless cars have everyone covered. If everyone had a driverless car, the cars have the roads signs programmed in them. The drunk driver's wouldn't be the ones driving because the computer will. Many people often get tickets because they disobey roads signs and break the speed limit. How can you get in trouble for something you didn't do. Why don't we just add on the fact this will help you save money too! Man, just like McDonalds "Im lovin' it!"  Some people will obviously be against the idea of driverless cars. The "haters" can't dull the shine of such a magnificent idea. I can't dull the fact that their conterarguments are something to consider. The weather is a great example. In some environments snow and rain can cause wrecks if the car is not somehow modified that the roads are bad. I suggest four wheel drive on all driverless cars. Another con is the fact that we are relying on technology. What if technology fails or the computer system goes wrong. Can we live with such uncertainty? Spare ourselfs the time to review and fix today to die tomorrow in a possible wreck due to this fear. By 2020 hopefully as they said, these cons will be reviewed and more reliable by then!  Aloha to driverless cars! The cars sound like a spectacular idea! I'm very excited to see what these cars will do for society. They have advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, with any product this will always be true. Driverless cars have pros like GPS navigation and they provide more safety for the people, but cons such as weather conditions or technical errors.          		0
I personally am not for driverless cars. I think that a person needs to operate a car not a computer. I think we need the brain of a person behind the wheel. When people hear driverless car they might think the car can do everything anot be be focused on the road for an emergency to happen.  There is alot of problems with technology now such as cell phones, computers,ect. There will be a big problem if something happens with the car and a wreck takes place who is a fault the technology or the person. All people need to be safe on the road or walking on the road so we need an alert persom behind the wheel.  People won't be focused on the road and if something is about to happen someone needs to be ready for an emergency so I think there will be alot of accidnets with the cars people will not be foucused like they are now not reliying on technology.  We rely on technology to much now. I think people will be bored behind the wheel and wait on their turn to drive. Technology is expensive to create and to buy. The cars will be over priced and won't sell that many. Not everyone will be offord one. So i think cost will be a problem with the cars to and taxes will be raised on the people to fun these cars and I don't think people will like that.  Driverless cars are not a good idea. They will not be safe because people will not be focused on the road anymore and that can be a problem for passegers or people on the side walks. Funding will be a problem I feel many people won't be able to buy them and with technology means people will lose there jobs and that's not a good thing. 		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for the Electoral College. As a high school student, I am concerned about the future of our country and believe that the Electoral College is the best way to ensure that the President represents the will of the people.  The Electoral College is a system in which each state is allocated a number of electors equal to its number of senators and representatives in Congress. These electors are chosen by the voters in each state, and they cast their votes for President on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December. The candidate who receives a majority of the electoral votes is elected President.  The Electoral College has been in place since the founding of our country, and it has served us well for over 200 years. It prevents a few large states from dominating the election and ensures that all states have a voice in choosing the President.  One of the biggest arguments against the Electoral College is that it can lead to a President being elected who did not win the popular vote. This happened in 2016, when Donald Trump won the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.  However, I believe that this is a rare occurrence and that the Electoral College is still the best way to ensure that the President represents the will of the people. In fact, a study by the University of Chicago found that the Electoral College has actually been more likely to elect the candidate who won the popular vote than the popular vote has been to elect the candidate who won the Electoral College.  Another argument against the Electoral College is that it is undemocratic. However, I believe that the Electoral College is actually more democratic than the popular vote. The popular vote is decided by a handful of states with large populations, while the Electoral College gives all states equal representation. This means that smaller states have a voice in the election, even if they have a smaller population.  I urge you to vote against any proposal to abolish the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a vital part of our democracy, and it ensures that all states have a voice in choosing the President.  Sincerely,  A Concerned High School Student		1
I think that having communityes without cars is great for the inviroment and if people want to do that then good for them. but i dont think i could survive with out a car and i dont think many people could just to get to work it may take and 1 hour- 30 minutes to get there. but if there was a community where no one had a car and everyone rode there bike ir walked. Then there would be no reason to have a car because then all your job oppertunitys would be close by and you would not need to drive to get there. So i really dont see my self ever being able to go and doing somethuing like not using a car.  but if thats what people want to do then thats good for them. i want people as a whole to be happy. i think that we can make our own decisions in our life and you know what people should not be judging someone else for there life decisions. its your life live it how you want i really makes me mad when people start getting mad at someone for something they have done because if it has already beeen done they cant go back and change it. it is already done and thats not cool. i think that a community with no cars would be good but not for me and i think there will be a good ammount of people would not give up a car just so they could go run and bike places?       ¬†       ¬†    		0
Dear Principal ,  I think community service would be wonderful for anyone to do. Community service could really come in handy one day, it could also be fun. There are a lot of reason why I think we should all do community service but I'm only going to name three. The first reason why i think we should take community service is because its very nice, it helps others out with some stuff and also it makes you feel better about yourself. So lets turn this around and get to talking!  Being nice to someone is always the right thing to do, nobody really knows how much that means to someone else if you just do one little nice thing. Community service is always about being nice some of the students thinks its a waste of time, but they don't know what it is until they actually see the peoples faces when we be nice and jump out of our way to make them happy. Its amazing how one person can actually do that.  Helping out others could really be a drag sometimes but when the work is done it looks a lot better. This world would be a lot of a better place if people would just help each other with some little things. For an example: Some lady is getting very old and she needs someone to cut her grass every week. Someone could be so nice enough and just go cut the grass for free and see how she's doing. Helping others and being nice is all in the same concept. We all need to just do it maybe for a week. Trust me if people would realize how much we can help in this world I think we all could do it !  Community service is not only good for them its also good for yourself. Doesn't everyone love the feeling that your a hero ? Well if everyone did a little bit of community service everyone would be a hero everyday! Feeling good about yourself is the best thing about life. But making someone else happy is amazing. Nobody understands how community service could help them but its not only about helping them its about doing the right thing and helping others. Be good to yourself and make yourself proud for once go out and help others.  Its all three in one being nice, helping others and making yourself feel good. And I would truly love to do that with people if you Mr. Principal would allow every student to do so. Its all called common curtsy. Not most people have what we have so if we cleaned, did jobs, painted. Whatever made someone else happy I think I could persuade every other students to help also. Thank you for your time TEACHER_NAME hope to see you there helping out others with us!      		0
The author of this article is only focused on one thing in this article. They describe all of these reasons on why traveling to Venus is unsafe yet completely ignores his own reasoning by replacing it with an unrealistic claim stating that astronomers want to explore it. Also, while they explain the density is the same and how Venus is "Often reffered to as Earth's "twin"," they bypass the subject of how much will it cost, how it will affect the United States as a whole.  The author is failing to realise just how unsafe it is to actually go to Venus. They do go on to talk about the "electronis made of silicon carbide," but it doesnt change the fact that we could not survive eight hundred degree wheather and neither could a space ship. the space carrier would melt when it came into the orbit of Venus. Also if the atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide is it really safe for anyone to go there. On Earth, we have a lot of pollution and a vast amount of carbon in the air but it is nowhere near the percentage in the article. Then you have a atmospheric pressure of ninety times more than our own. The article describes how that would crush a submarine that has been made to search the lowest points of the ocean. The article states in paragraph three, "Also noteable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probe seeking land on its surface."  The author is not taking into account the people who would need to go on this mission as well. We are talking about a human that if they were to get past the spot where they are orbiting that they will be faced with all of these horific obstacles. The lightning strikes would try to kill anyone who tries to find land on the surfac, yet they are trying to send people to find out about their curiosities? Are we okay with that? All of these factors will end up in a loss of a human if we try to step foot on Venus and that is not worth the curiosity of a few.  Attempting to go to Venus would be extremely costly and would be a very poor choice on our part in the long run. We are talking about putting a group of people and equipment that cost billions to trillions of dollars on a space exploration that has a vast possibility of not coming home. It would cost us a fortune and no onewould gain from it. Hypothetically, let's say the the craft landed, what are they going to have to face to get a rock and gas sample? The volcanoes, lightning strikes, and powerful earthquakes would kill everything and everyone on board before the can let out a sigh of relief. Venus may have been an Earth-like planet but as of right now, no one would benefit from an exploration there.  Venus can remain a mystery. The author writing this article is not thinking about the good for everyone and/or the possibility of it even becoming a reality. The whole article is flawed because even though we are alike in size and occasionally distance, no one has survived the landing for a reason. The planet is too dangerous for us to even think about trying to explore, so we will wait to see if factors change but for now the author wrote this article poorly. We are not ready at this point in time and we may never be but the curiosity of a few are not worth the risks.		0
When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Asking for advice is like getting a check-up; it benefits everyone. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices, for it can benefit some of his or her decisions, helps with deciding on things, and can give better options of choices.  To begin with, seeking multiple opinions can benefit some of his or her decisions. Some people tend to ask for advice when something is extremely hard to decide on. Half of those people ask one person while the other half asks multiple people. Asking multiple people, however, helps to knock out the bad options that they assume will not benefit the situation you are in. It also helps you with getting better opinions, towards your choices, from them. For example, my friend, Generic_Name, needed advice from someone about a situation that was going on in her life at the time. She asked one person, but their opinion did not help her with the decisions she had to make. So, she asked multiple friends of hers for their opinions. After narrowing her options down from what her friends had said, she successfully made a better decision that benefit her afterwards.  Also, it can help with deciding on things. When you are put into a situation that needs something to be decided on, most ask others, because the pressure and stress from that problem gives that person a hard time. With the supportive opinions and choices given from your friends or family, the stress and anxiety that comes around soon disintegrates¬†and feels like a huge weight is lifted off your shoulders once the problem is fixed. For instance, I was put in a situation where I had to make a tough decision. Due to the fact it was already stressful and hard to handle, I asked a few of my friends for advice on it. After them supporting me and helping me decide on what they thought I should do, I eventually made the right decision for myself.  To end with, this can give better options of choices. Half the time, people think their options for their own problem will be helpful, because it is less time and stress for them. Sometimes, friends or family may have better opinions for you. If you get different opinions and more options, it makes deciding a lot easier. Your list of choices may be added to or taken away from, but either way, putting multiple options together from what others may have said will make deciding easier due to to better options. To illustrate, my brother, Generic_Name, needed help deciding on what project choice he should do for his end of the year project. He made the assumption it would be better to ask people he knew would be able to help him make that decision. After asking his other siblings, including me, he narrowed down his options by deciding on what he enjoyed most to the amount of points he would get doing certain projects and finally made a good choice from the options we had given him.  However, seeking multiple opinions could make things harder when making a choice. Sometimes, getting opinions could make the problem worse, because one of your friends may say something you will not like or just something you do not want¬†to hear. Multiple opinions can also add stress to you because everyone you ask may say completely different things, which will not help you make the choice. You could also be given options that, either do not make any sense for your situation or make everything harder for you.  In conclusion, when people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Seeking multiple opinions from people can benefit choices by knocking out the bad options and getting better options for you. It can also help you decide on things by getting the support from your friends during the hard times of deciding on something. Lastly, you are given better options, whether it is taking away or adding to the options you already have. This is why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.		0
Cell phones are very dangerous in today's time. Did you know that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction that driving under the influence of alcohol? Did you know that it only takes a couple of seconds to park your car? Did you know that having your cell phone in your hand is illegal in today's time? I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.  To start off, there are several things that could happen if you choose to use your cell phone while driving. You could run off the road, you could hit someone else's car, or you could hit an actual person. You never know what could happen if you choose to pick up your phone. You should consider other motorists. You should consider protecting the pedestrians. You should consider your passengers. You should defiantly consider yourself.  Using your cell phone while driving is something that you shouldn't do. You never know what other lives you could affect just because you want to use your phone. Maybe you think, it will just be for a few seconds to text someone back but in those few seconds your life can change tremendously. It only takes a few seconds to park your car. Instead of taking your own life and someone else's in those few seconds, you can park your car and then use your phone. The vehicles can be replaced but the people inside those vehicles can't.  Finally, using your phone while driving is illegal. If you choose to use your phone, you are going to end up having to pay a ticket, living with the regret of hurting other people around you and living with pain because of the minute you needed on your phone. Whoever you think you must respond to or look at, would much rather you make it to your destination in one piece then responding to their text or call.  That person would want you to wait until you are parked than to take someone else's life and your own.  In conclusion, it all comes down to using your phone while driving or not. I hope you always remember that one text, call, or scroll is not worth it. Keep your eyes on the road and always give behind the wheel, all your effort. No one wants to get into a car wreck, sometimes it does happen but don't let the reason of it be, you are using your phone. I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.   		0
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:  Playing a sport in a community park is one of the most enjoyable ways to spend time outdoors. I think this because it's a great way to get some exercise, meet new people, and have fun.  First of all, playing a sport in a community park is a great way to get some exercise. Running around and playing games outside can help you stay healthy and fit. It's also a lot of fun! You get to run around and play with your friends, which makes it feel less like exercise and more like a fun activity. Plus, you don't have to worry about getting bored or feeling like you're missing out on something else to do.  Another reason why playing a sport in a community park is so enjoyable is that you get to meet new people. When you're playing a sport, you're surrounded by other people who are also there to have fun and get some exercise. This means you get to make new friends and connect with people who have similar interests. It's also a great way to learn new skills and techniques from other players.  Finally, playing a sport in a community park is just plain fun! There's something about being outside and enjoying nature that makes it feel like a special treat. You get to breathe in fresh air, feel the sun on your face, and hear the sounds of birds chirping and children laughing. It's a great way to relax and unwind after a long day of school.  Overall, playing a sport in a community park is an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors because it's a great way to get exercise, meet new people, and have fun. So next time you're looking for something to do outside, consider grabbing a ball and heading to your local community park!		1
Driveless Cars are the new future. I think that driveless cars will be very helpful and fun for everyone in the world. I think they would be helpful, entertaining, and useful. Although cars now are very useful, I believe that the Driveless Cars will be even more useful for the future.  Driveless Cars would be helpful to us because it could possibly cause us less accidents. Everyday there is an accident at least somewhere. The causes to some of these accidents could be texting, drinking and driving, not paying attention, or just bad roads. But the major one that we have is the texting and driving. There is over 50% that someone is either texting or on the phone with someone and they get in an accident. Drivless cars you don't have to do anything really. Yes you still have to pay attention but you can glance down a time or two. Also these cars will alarm you when to take over the car. They alarm you when it's bad traffic or if theres an accident ahead. It also has you take over once you are pulling in or out of a driveway. I think that it is very helpful for that because it'll most likley decrease the amount of accidents we could have a day.  Driveless cars just seem like it would be fun. Who wouldnt want a car that can go off on its own and need you to take control over only sometimes? You can actually enjoy yourself and look around. You are still paying attention to the road but just not as much as when you are driving. When you are driving you have to be focused on the road and other drivers at the same time. The driverless cars do that for you. They also watch you. They make sure that you still pay attention to the road. The car also gives you a second to prepare yourself for when you are about to take over. I think that it would just be enjoy able and fun to have a Driverless car.  Nobody likes to fill up their car and use money. Everybody hates how many times a week they have to stop and get gas. The driverless car uses half the fuel of todays taxis. They also offer a lot more flexibility than a bus. In the passage "Driverless Cars Are Coming" Sergey Brin says "He believes such cars fundamentally change the world." (paragraph 1). This could be saving your money and very useful. Sergey Brin also predicts that he can see these Driverless Cars into a Public transport taxi system. That would be really useful to the world and again save a lot of our money.  In conclusion I think that the Driverless Cars would be Helpful, entertaining, and useful to our world. I think that it could really change our world and have a big impact on it. Although cars now are very useful, I believe that the Driveless Cars will be even more useful for the future. 		0
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:  Wisdom and experience are some of the most valuable things in life. And who better to learn from than our parents or guardians? They've been around for way longer than we have, and they've seen and experienced so much more than we have. They've learned things the hard way, and they can teach us how to avoid making the same mistakes they did.  I know that sometimes my mom can be super annoying, but she's also really smart and wise. She's always giving me advice and telling me stories about her life when she was my age. And let me tell you, she's been through some stuff! She's had to deal with way more challenges than I have, and she's come out on top every time. Whenever I'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed, she always knows just what to say to make me feel better.  My dad is also really wise. He's always telling me about the importance of hard work and perseverance. He's never had an easy life, but he's always found a way to make it work. He's taught me that no matter how hard things get, if you keep pushing forward, you can achieve anything you set your mind to.  But it's not just my parents who are wise. My grandparents are really cool too. They've been around for a long time, and they've seen so much change in the world. They've learned how to adapt and be flexible, and they've taught me how to do the same. They're always sharing stories about their past, and it's really interesting to hear about how things were when they were my age.  I think it's really important to listen to and learn from our parents and guardians. They've been around for a long time, and they've got a lot of experience under their belt. They can teach us so much about life and how to navigate it. And even though we might not always agree with them, it's important to respect their wisdom and listen to what they have to say.  In conclusion, obtaining wisdom and experience from someone like a parent or guardian is really important. They've		1
Summer is a time for spending time with friends, traveling, and overall relaxation. With all the excitement and memories made, students tend to forget everything that was taught over the school year. This is why summer projects were made, so students can continue to learn and improve; rather than having to start all over again in the fall. Though, it can be a burden because, school is the last thing children want to think about over the break, it is ultimately beneficial. Depending on the subject, summer projects can be somewhat challenging as well. This is why summer projects should be teacher-designed and not student-designed because, teachers know what needs to be worked on and can go over it when school starts again.  Teachers really do know what needs to be worked on. Working with kids all the time, they know how their students operate and what would benefit them the most. Teachers also know that with certain topics, some students struggle and some thrive. This practically means that, teachers can create a format that helps everyone collectively over the summer. Also, being an educator comes with some years of experience. Making homework assignments and tests for a class is like second nature to some because, they do it all the time. So, making a project should be right in their expertise. Though, students may be able to put together a project over the summer, having teachers design it makes a more powerful impact in the long run.  Projects made by teachers are also a good way to start off the new school year because, they can go over it in class. Even though, young people have just gotten off of break and our walking through the halls to get to their classes, they have the information they gathered over the summer that, once in class, can refresh their memory. That way teachers can review and they'll process the information faster. Another thing, this puts students at an advantage since they have touched on certain topics already. Better grades could come out of it too. Overall, these components give youth a heightened amount of confidence going into the new year.  Summer is approaching soon, taking time to cool off and let loose is important, but so is being a succesful student. Maybe taking sometime out of your vacation to go over some things. From them knowing what needs to be discussed, to being able to get a headstart at school. Teacher-designed projects are the best option when it comes to continuing ones learning process. Soon the results could show for it too.		0
Limiting car usage would have many advantages to the community around it. But the main two advantages to limithing cars is the reduction of polution,and also the reduction of congestion in many suburbs. Many cities including Bogota,Paris,and cities surrounding those have already started to limit the usage of cars.  One big problem many scientist are beginning to find out about our world is that our ozone layer is being desroyed by polution we put in the air. A big contributer to polution is the exhaust being produced by the million of cars used everyday. Another big problem countrys all over the world have to worry about is smog,or a thick layer of fog that is really hard to see through. having this very dangerous factor in the road many car crash ratings have sky rocketed. One way this can be stop is to do what these few country have been doing, that is to have days through out the year where people cant use their cars at all. To help in force this day police have been giving people fines roughly around thirty dollars. In Bogota,Colombia it was the third straight year cars have been banned. after all these years of banning cars the turnout was large. despite gray clouds that poured rain all over Bogota. When the smog went away from Bogota many other cities from Colombia have joined the event of banning cars. a qoute from  Car-Free Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota says that " Parks and sprots centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven,pitted sidewalks ahve been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts ahve cropped up". To have these results to such a simple idea is incredible.  Another big problem in pretty much all countrys is congestion of their inner streets. When streets have major traffic alot of things change including the mood of people,and there is a higher percentage of car crashes. To fix this problem many cities did pretty much the same as before to retrict cars on certain days. A brilliant idea was presented and used in Paris. The idea was that "on Mondays motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave= their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31), The same would apply to odd-numbered plates that following day". After this brilliant event finished congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, and after five days the smog was gone.  In conclusion the advantages of limiting cars had a far greater output than input and has also solved many big problems. All we canhope for is the parcipitation of more and more countys or cities to help lives and our world.    		0
Phones and Driving  Texting and driving is never okay but that doesn't mean that phones should never be used while driving. There are beneficial uses of cellphones that allow drivers to get to their destination is a faster, happier way. Technology keeps advancing and is even included in newer cars or other vehicles. Not everyone has, or can afford a new car though. This means that they must rely on their phone for music, GPS, and emergency phone calls.  Music can be a big deal for drivers because in certain kinds of situations such as long drives. Long, extended drives causes drivers to not be able to focus on where they're supposed to be going, also called highway hypnosis. Music allows drivers to focus better and keep them attentive. It also keeps drivers in a good mood which causes less stress and road rage.  GPS is the most necessary reason for using a phone when the car doesn't have that kind of technology. GPS is safer than writing down directions or using a map. The driver doesn't have to look down at the phone either because most GPS services have a voice speaking out directions for them.  Sometimes drivers have absolute emergency phone calls that they must take. They don't have to put their phone up to their ear since there are other ways around it. Drivers could use the speaker option on their phone or Bluetooth. An emergency call could include calling the police for reckless drivers or crashes. Personal emergency calls include a wife going into labor or needing to take a detour to pick kids up from school.  Drivers should never text and drive, however there are still plausible uses for phones such as getting directions from GPS, listening to music as entertainment, and emergency phone calls for various reasons. Most reasons for phones are unnecessary especially with the technology provided in newer cars. If the driver has a car that has everything available, then their phone is not needed in their presence.  Wilcox 2                                                                              		0
The more people you ask the more it will help you as a person. When getting advice, I believe the more opinions you get the better. It is good to ask many people because, you can get better advice, you can also get different points of view, and you can decide on what the best decision is. I agree with asking multiple people for advice because, it only benefits you, and there are almost no cons. When you are in need, and desperate for help, asking many people for advice is the best thing to do.  The more people you ask for advice, the better answers you will get, and you will be able choose what's best for you. It is good to get the best advice you can because, it will help you and the situation you're in. Once you know who gives the best advice, if you have a problem down the road, then you can ask that same person for advice. When you get good advice, you will be able to adapt to those kind of situations, and you will know what to do in future situations. It is definantly worth it to just ask a few more people of their opinion.  When you are asking many people for advice you are guaranteed to get different points of view. When you get different points of view, you will be able to look at your situation in a different way. When you see things from a different point of view you will be able to see what is happening on your side of the situation, and the other side of the situation. When you can see all sides of the situation you may realize that some people have it worse than you do, and you should be grateful for what you have. When someone gives you a different way to look at things, it can really change who you are as a person.  When you ask many people for advice and you know what is best, and how to look at the situation, you will come to realize what the best decision is to make in your circumstances. Although what you may have to do is hard, it will help you in the long run. By making only one decision, it could lead you to success in the future. Once you have been able to figure out what decision is best, eventually you will be a good decision maker and may not need advice from others. Make sure when everything is going through your head, that you believe the decision you made was best.  In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice can help you tremendously. Not only will it help you in the present, but it will also help you in the future. Just asking a few more people will help you get better advice, teach you how to look at things with a different point of view, and to become a good decision maker. It will help you and lead to success in many ways you dont expect. Asking those few extra people for their opinion is so worth it.		0
 In recent years, some businesses have adopted a four-day workweek with each day consisting of ten hours. While this model may have its benefits, I believe that my school should not follow this trend by extending the school day two hours. This extension would lead to several disadvantages, including exhaustion, decreased productivity, and a lack of time for family and personal responsibilities.  Firstly, extending the school day would lead to exhaustion, as students would have to attend school for an additional two hours each day. This would likely result in a decrease in productivity and a decrease in the quality of learning. Furthermore, students may feel overwhelmed and stressed, leading to a decrease in their overall well-being.  Secondly, extending the school day would take away valuable time for family and personal responsibilities. Students need time to spend with their families, pursue hobbies, and engage in other activities outside of school. By extending the school day, students would have less time for these activities, which could lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from their loved ones.  Finally, extending the school day would not necessarily result in increased revenue or resources for the school. While some students may prefer to work and make money, many students need time to focus on their studies and achieve their academic goals. By extending the school day, students may be less likely to attend school, which could result in a decrease in enrollment and revenue.  In conclusion, while the four-day workweek model may have its benefits, my school should not follow this trend by extending the school day two hours. This extension would lead to several disadvantages, including exhaustion, decreased productivity, and a lack of time for family and personal responsibilities. Instead, my school should focus on providing students with a well-rounded education that balances academic excellence with personal and family well-being.		1
Dear Florida state senator,  In few words, the United States should keep the Electoral Collage. Although the people may not depend on them, it does not mean that they are dependable either. The United States may have a long process of voting for a president for the country that in which only they can choose rather than the people, but it still is being done for the good of the countries' future.  The process for gaining a president may be long and not allow the peoples' voices to matter, but the future of the country cannot be placed on their unreliable descisions. Not all of the people are experienced on the ways of the government as the Electoral College or the House of Representatives are. In truth, you may never know that if a certified member of any one of the states is actually on the side for the greater good of the country. An enemy country may pay for any large number of citizens to elect a certain candidate that could be working for them. This could happen with the Electoral Collage. They may be paid by an organization working against the U.S. or by one of the candidates themselves for personal gain. But even if it did happen, as it claims in Source 1, by the Office of the Federal Registar, there would be the House of Representatives to also give the last vote if there were to be a tie. Source 3 states that there is an equal number of electors¬† which gives every state a chance of getting in the matter of equally electing a candidate for president.  Many things could happen while there is a new president to be elected. As I said before: the Electoral College may be paid to pick one candidate for president over the other. Source 2, by Bradford Plumer, states that the Electoral College has its defenses. Some of its members may be replaced in a state for that states' personal gain in the matter. Even so, it would be hard to tell. For the most part, it is the unfairness of not counting the peoples thoughts and opinions. It is their country as well!  All in all, it is very unreliable to put trust in the people, or anyone, for voting a president. Not many people may like the Electoral College, or their final descision, but even then it is the best way of getting a fair vote on a president. They will be there to select the new future of the country, besides being their job to do so, as opposed to the American people having duties elsewhere. They may want a candidate over the other, but even then by the end of the day, they would be in the same square they were on even before there was to be a new president elected. Even so, if there is a change in their style of living that they frown upon, they can always alert Congress.    		0
In America, cars are considered an important necessity to life. Cars get people from one place to another in a significantly shorter amount of time than walking from place to place. Cars, however, aren't as beneficial as they may seem. Motorized vehicles are harmful to the environment and ourselves because they release an immense amount of greenhouse gases and force other countries around the world to ban the use of cars to restrict smog.  Firstly, the amount of greenhouse gases released in the United States alone is relatively high compared to more suburban countries. In some large U.S. cities, cars produce approximately 50% of the total greenhouse gases, according to "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars". That percent is extremely high compared to Europe where cars produce only about 12% of the greenhouse gases. Beijing, however, is more polluted than the United States and is said to be the most polluted city in the world. France, on the other hand, has made it a law where certain cars are forbidden to drive on certain days. As a result of France's action, congestion decreased by 60 percent in the capital of Paris. If the United States took a step forward to reduce pollution, the air quality would benefit rather than gradually decline.  Furthermore, other countries around the world have made an effort to reduce pollution. In Bogota, Colombia, there is one day a year where cars are banned with only buses and taxis permitted. The day called "Day Without Cars" is promoting alternative transportation and is reducing smog. Vauban, France, for example, is a suburban city where cars are forbidden. Ownership is allowed, however, there are only two places to park and the cost is 40,000 just for a space to park. The people in Vauban tend to be happier and less tense, according to Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. Paris is a more urban city than Vauban but has still made efforts to benefit air quality. Motorists with evennumbered license plates were demanded to leave their cars at home on Monday. Motorists with oddnumbered license plates left their vehicles home on Tuesday. Congestion decreased by 60 percent. Other countries around the world have put an effort to reduce pollution from motorized vehicles and the results were positive environmentally and mentally.  The use of automobiles greatly impacts the environment and society negatively. Greenhouse gases pollute the air and driving cars produces mental instability in some cases. Other countries such as Colombia and France have taken a step to reduce pollution and since the cars in the United States produce 50% of the greenhouse gases, the U.S. should concider following Colombia and France's ideas.		0
Should you join the program with Luke?  You should join the program with Luke because its a now expereance and you should always try new things out.  "Lukes friend Don Reist invited him to go to Euroupe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."  This shows if you are a farmer that loves being with farm animals, than this would be a good thing for you to do. You would be able to be with animals all the time.  "World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA. UNRRA hired "Seagoing cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."  That give a good reason to join the UNRRA because you can help bring farm animals to places where there are no farm animals. You can help the farm animals find a home. You would be able to bond with other animals and save them from the wild and then take good care of them.  "With a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them." This shows another reason to joins the program and help feed the farm animals over seas.  "I'm greatful for the opportunities, he says. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.  "You will probably feel the same way he did. You will feel good for the joy and happyness you give the other people when you give them there new farm animals. You should join the programe to go with the new experiece and make new friends and bond with animals.		0
Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle.  Drivers are at a four time greater risk of causing an accident when driving and texting. While using their cell phones drivers lose sight of the task at hand and stop paying attention to what they are doing. According to the "National Safety Council" "Cell phones used while operating a motor vehicle leads to 1.6 million crashes a year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused from distracted driving by cell phone usage." Not many take driving seriously until you consider how many people die each day and how many in a year due to a fatal car crash. Well According to "Teen Safety" "Over 3,287 deaths occur daily due to a car crash."  Distracted driving whether it be from cell phone usage, eating, drinking, operating a radio, or even being lost in thought, it can lead to injuries or even death. When a vehicle is moving at the speed of 35 to 45 mph, Depending on the age of the drivers and passengers in both cars determines the fatality or how sever the injuries are in an accident.  When drivers are trying to text and drive at the same time they are not thinking about how their actions can affect those around them. Drivers are not thinking about how they are putting someone else's life at risk or in danger when they are distracted driving from improper cell phone usage. Drivers are not considering that from the actions they are taking by using their cell phones that someone could lose their life or end up in the hospital with very severe injuries. Drivers who cannot wait to use their phone until the vehicle has come to a complete stop meaning that the vehicle is completely off are being really selfish and inconsiderable of those around them.  So in conclusion drivers should not be able to use a cell phone while operating a motor vehicle because it is not safe for them or those around them and it can and will affect someone's life whether it's the driver who is using their cell phones to the people in the opposite car that they have had an accident with even down to the passengers in the same vehicle.      		0
Cars have been around for many years and generations. People rely on cars for transportation. However, theres places where car usage is being limited because of the pollution it causes to the environment and help create a better environment for the people.  For for starters, one reason car usage is being limited is because of how much pollution it brings to the environment. According to article 2 paragraph 17, Paris usually has the most smog than any other European capital. The smog cleared enough for the French party to remove the ban of odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. This means cars have been a great cause of the smog in the city. In Bogota Colombia, thers a car-free day in act. According to article 3 paragraph 21, the goal of the day was to promote other transportation and to reduce smog. This shows that people aren't considerate when it comes to the environment and don't realize the pollution they're causing. Therefore limiting car usage is beneficial.  Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it can help create a healthier environment. According to article 2, people would participate in Day Without Cars regardless of weather. "The rain hasn't stopped people from participating." explained Bogota Mayor Antanas. The campaign brought constructs of 118 miles of bicycle paths. Parks and sport centers also grew. This demostrates that people are determine to make the environment they live in into a better place to live. Aritcle 4 states that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year. This shows America is probably leaving driving for better alternatives for the environment and their lives. And limitation to car usage was a big key to this behaviour change.  Although driving has been abused for years, places are beginning to limit the usage of cars. Some of the reasons cars are being ban are due to the pollution is causes and it helps create a better environment for the city and people lives. Would limitations of car usage ever completely get rid of cars as a transportation.    		0
 The electoral college is a group of electors who are tasked with selecting the president of the United States. The system has been in place since 1787, but do they truly work? The electoral college system was designed as a compromise to give equal representation to larger and smaller states, but does it still serve that purpose today?  One of the main criticisms of the electoral college is that it can lead to a candidate ignoring certain states in favor of others. For example, in 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote, but lost the election to George W. Bush. This was partly because Bush was able to win key states, such as Florida and Texas, that Al Gore did not focus on enough. This can lead to a candidate focusing only on states that are likely to vote for them, leaving other states without representation in the election.  Another criticism of the electoral college is that it does not accurately represent the will of the people. The popular vote is the total number of votes cast by all eligible voters in the country, and is often seen as the more true representation of the population's choice for president. However, the electoral college ignores this vote and instead gives weight to the votes of each state based on its population. This can lead to a candidate winning the presidency despite losing the popular vote.  Proponents of the electoral college argue that it gives each state an equal say in the election, regardless of its size. They also argue that the electoral college helps to prevent a candidate from winning by simply winning in densely populated urban areas. This argument is valid to some extent, but it can also be seen as a way of preserving the status quo and denying representation to larger cities and states.  In conclusion, whether or not the electoral college works is a complex and controversial issue. While the system has some positive aspects, such as giving equal representation to each state, it also has some negative consequences, such as ignoring certain states and not accurately representing the will of the people. Whether or not the electoral college needs to be reformed is a debate that many will continue to have. However, one thing is certain: the electoral college will continue to play a significant role in the election of the president of the United States.		1
Human emotion recognition software should be used in the classroom. First it could appeal differently to each students larning style, or be modified to teach him/her how the student wants. Lastly, it could see if a student is getting bored with the lesson or if he/she likes the lesson. This could help children learn alot better in a learning enviroment tailored just for them.  First, it could appeal differently to each student. This means that if it notices a kid frowning when showed a hard problem or a large group of text, it could change what it is doing but keeps the concept of what it is teaching. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective instructor." This shows that the program could be used for the betterment of teaching for different people, not all people learn the same way, so why should it all be taught the same way. The computer could fix that by modifying the way it teaches.  Lastly, it could see if a student is getting bored with the lesson or if he/she likes the lesson. If a student, me especially, dosen't like a lesson or thinks it is boring, he/she wont learn. A computer that reads faces to get the emotions of students would keep the lesson being taught livley and more fun to keep students entertained. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective instructor." I used the same quote twice once in the second paragraph and now, in this paragraph becauses it strongly supports both of my claims. If a computer where to "modify the lesson, like an effective instructor" students would always be engaged in learning because the lesson would always change to what is needed to keep students entertained.  Human emotion recognition software should be used in the classroom. If used in a classroom, it would greatly keep students engaged in learning. personally, I would love having something like this in the classroom to keep me interested in the lesson. Wraped up, having this tool would greatly improve the entirety of the school learning enviroment. 		0
Dear Principal,  In my opinion, community service is wonderful. Cleaning up our planet is a righteous thing to do. However, other students here are not as enthusiastic as I am about it. Just the thought of cleaning up litter in our school gives me joy. Besides, community service is important. Students should participate.  For getting students excited about community service, I have a plan to propose to you. What if we create a game that has to do with this subject? We can give a large prize to the person who did the most amount of community service in school, their neighborhood, or at home. Each student will receive a log to write down how many hours they did in the course of two weeks. We can begin this on March 7th. The deadline should be March 21st.  For the grand prize, we could give out a ten pound bag of assorted candies for the winner to share, or have for themselves. What do you think of this plan? This is a rough draft. If you like this plan but think there could be some tweaking, do as you please. I will be waiting for your reply.  P.S. Let's not tell them about the prize, make it mysterious.  Yours truly,  STUDENT_NAME		0
The implementation of a four-day school week has been a topic of debate in recent years. While some argue that it would have a positive impact on student academic performance and wellbeing, others argue that it would have a negative impact. In this essay, I will analyze the effects of a four-day school week on students, as well as consider the role of technology in the learning environment and examine the potential outcomes if schools adopt a four-day school week.  One study conducted by the University of Utah found that students who attended school on Fridays had lower levels of absenteeism and higher levels of academic performance compared to those who did not attend school on Fridays (University of Utah, 2021). This suggests that a four-day school week may have a positive impact on student academic performance. Additionally, a four-day school week would give students more time to focus on their studies and complete homework assignments, which could lead to higher levels of academic performance.  However, some argue that a four-day school week would have a negative impact on student wellbeing. They argue that students need a full week to decompress and recharge, and that a four-day school week would not provide enough time for this. Furthermore, a four-day school week would require students to attend school for longer periods of time on each day, which could lead to increased stress and burnout.  The role of technology in the learning environment is also an important consideration. Technology has the potential to enhance the learning experience for students, but it can also be a distraction. If schools adopt a four-day school week, it will be important to ensure that students are using technology in a responsible and effective manner. This may involve implementing policies to limit screen time and providing students with the necessary support and resources to use technology effectively.  In terms of the potential outcomes if schools adopt a four-day school week, it is difficult to say for certain. Some argue that a four-day school week would lead to higher levels of student engagement and motivation, while others argue that it would lead to decreased academic performance and increased absenteeism. It will be important for schools to carefully consider the potential outcomes and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision.  In conclusion, the implementation of a four-day school week has both advantages and disadvantages. While it may have a positive impact on student academic performance, it may also have		1
The FACS  FACS got your attenshion right yeah the FACS is a facial action coding system. The FACS can tell the person how the the person feels just by looking at there face like and exmaple is the Mona Lisa they read irs face withe the FACS. They said it was 83% happy 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry. It is useful but i dont think it should be used in classrooms to read students. 3 reasons why I think thats teh FACS should't be allowed in school are sometimes people dont want to talk about ther lifes in school and another reason is that it would go to kids personal lifes and the last reason is it may make kids feel weird knowing that others know how they feel and so will there parents .  Going back to the first reason that may sometimes people dont want to talk about ther lifes in school. Sometimes people dont want to talk about ther lifes in school kids may think others kids will make of them for being sad or fearful. An exmaple of a kid being scared of what other will think of them for being scared or super kind are bullies. Bullies most of time become the way they are is becaues they feel like others will hate them the way they are or hey have been juged becaues of there feelings.  Lets get into another reason that the FACS would be a bad thing to have in schools is that it would go to kids personal lifes and most kids dont like talking about they'r home life. you may say it would take some presser off the kids if they feel bad or sad and we could talk to them. But some kids that don't want to talk about it and the kids that feel ok will feel like the sad kids get more attenshion so will want to be sad. Like when i was younger i used to want attenchion so if kids find a key to get attenshion they will want to be sad.  The last reason is it may make kids feel weird knowing that others know how they feel. Also it may make the kids parents feel weird or angry becaues they probly dont want people basicly spying on there kids. If i were one of the kids dad i would want the school spying on my kid. If alots of parents feel that way and which schools the school with the FACS will lose lots of money.  3 reasons why I think thats teh FACS should't be allowed in school are sometimes people dont want to talk about ther lifes in school and another reason is that it would go to kids personal lifes and the last reason is it may make kids feel weird knowing that others know how they feel and so will there parents. That is why i dont want the FACS in schools.                                       		0
Learning what you will need to be successful later from your own home sounds awesome! Some schools offer students to learn at home from online classes or video conferencing with teachers and educational professionals. Having students attend school at home is a benefit because they can receive more help, they are able to focus more on school, and have more time to do things that interest them.  First, Students benefit from learning at home because they can receive more help that they need. When we are working alone and need help it is easier to receive one-on-one help. Also, not having others around you makes it easier to ask as many¬†questions as you need to without having to interrupt¬†someone else or to be rushed cause someone else has a question. Being able to ask questions one-on-one also helps so people do nt make fun of you for things you need help with. You are also able to go over your notes as many times as you need to before taking a quiz or test to make sure you understand. Also you can highlight and make you notes easy for you to understand things easily. Therefore learning at home helps you to do better and to get help that you need when you need it.  Secondly, getting your education at home helps you to focus on school more when u are in a small learning environment. Focusing becomes easier with a quieter place, which you are given when you are at home, compared to a class room with 20-30 students in it. When completing assignments you have the time you need to complete it and the time to focus so you do well and to look over it. Having people there to bother you is no longer a problem when you are at home learning because it is just you along with your family not a bunch of people. Focusing on your education so you can succeed later on down the road is a very important thing and learning at home gives the focus to you.  Finally, being able to work from home gives you more time to do things that you like to do. With being at home working you get to work on your own pace and get a lot or a little done at anytime within your deadlines. You are also able to do work at anytime or any day of the week because it is up to you when you work as long as it is done within the time frame given to you. Having time to spend with family and to do things like sports or hanging out with your friends is very important to you mental and emotional health and the time is made when you do work at home. Learning at home has made it easier for you to get time to do things that you enjoy but you get school done as well.  However, some say that learning through online classes or through video conferencing does not help the student learn what they will need to get the knowledge they will need for the real world. Students are not learning enough at home because they have easier access to looking up the answers or to someone telling the answers instead of being able to show the knowledge they know in the topic. But, others say that learning from the confront of your own home helps you do better and then you do not have to worry about how long you take and how much time that you take to review¬†so that you are well prepared. Students receive their education through learning online just as well as they do sitting in a classroom.  In conclusion, schools should allow students to learn from distance classes such as online or through video conferencing. Having education options for¬†students at home helps them to get more help whenever they need it, they are able to focus better, and to have more time to do things them enjoy. Everyone needs the option to help themselves do better. Let students learn wherever¬†they will do the best and can succeed in life.		0
Hey there!  So, I'm supposed to write an essay about how older students can be helpful to younger students.  I mean, it's a pretty cool topic, but I'm not sure I'm the best person to write about it.  But, I'll give it a shot!  First of all, older students can be super helpful to younger students by teaching them new things. Like, I'm in 8th grade now, and I know a lot of stuff that my little brother didn't know when he was in 6th grade.  I mean, he's still learning some stuff, but I can help him out with his homework and stuff. It's like, I know I'm not a teacher or anything, but I can still help him out.   Another way older students can be helpful is by being good role models. Like, I know I'm not perfect or anything, but I try my best to be a good example for my little brother. I show him that it's important to do your homework, and to always try your best. And if he has any questions, I'm always there to help him out.   Oh, and older students can also help younger students by being friends. Like, I have a lot of friends in my grade, and we all hang out together. And sometimes, my little brother will come to our hangouts and stuff. It's like, he gets to hang out with older kids and learn from us, and we get to hang out with him and have fun.   But, there are also some things that older students shouldn't do. Like, they shouldn't babysit younger students all the time. I mean, it's nice that we can help out, but we also need some time to hang out with our own friends and do our own things.  And we definitely shouldn't try to boss around younger students. Like, I know I'm older than my little brother, but I don't go around telling him what to do all the time.   So, that's my essay!  I		1
To the Principal:  I think that in some way this is a good thing but also a bad thing. A good reason is that it will push students to strive for academic excellence. A bad reason might be that a person tries hard enough, but still does not have a B average. People who have a C average still should be able to play because sports will keep them out of trouble. Also, if you take sports or other activities from them, you take the thing that they most enjoy away from them.  So principal, I submit to you that if you change the policy, you will unhappy students and parents complaining to you. If a student is striving for the best they can do but still does not have a B average, they should be able to participate in sports or any other extra curricular activities. Teachers can report to you whether or not an athlete is really striving for a B average or more. If they do not meet these requirements on their progress reports, they should be able to practice but not play.  These are some specific reasons why this policy is a good idea but at the same time a bad one as well. If you keep the policy the same and students will try their best, every thing should work out at the school for parents and teachers alike for sports and other extra curricular activities. That is how I fell and most of the student body on this new grades for sports and other extra curricular activities. I believe that this will be a good balanced of effort and averages.		0
Did you ever have an extracurricular activity or also known as an after school activity in school? Some students after school participate in clubs or sports like the year book, student council, or football. Now some schools they may require you to participate in an after school activity, and others may not. Personally i am against it because many students work after school, many students have no interest in any, and many students who dont want to be there will be a distraction to those who do want to be there.  First there a quiet a few people work after school, it may be a legit job, or baby sitting, or cleaning out a neighbors yard thats how they earn money. If they have to participate in an after school activity they cant get money to be able to support there self. They may even become unreliable if they have to keep taking time of work to do a school activity. If you ever do small jobs such as baby sitting, and yard work for other people you have to be reliable and if they need you to do it a certain day you pretty much have to unless you want to lose that job of yours.  Secondly some students just may have no interest in any of them. Maybe a few students interest happen during school such as welding and culinary. Now if your already doing what you want to do why would you do anything else if you have no interest. If they dont want to be there they can be a distraction to those who do, and it could cause problems between members.  Lastly it could cause stress. School puts pressure on its students and putting another on top of it will make it worse. Have you ever stopped and thought about what students do daily between there classes with project and home work. Some students manage it but others cant and often blow up with all the stress they're going through. Some students often go to there guidance counselor to know how to deal with stress and often times go back to them again.  In conclusion an after school activity is bad for students because it takes up time for a job, some students dont want to there, and it causes stress. Now of course there are some cons like that it helps you socials more, but if they dont want to be there you'll find them not socializing. Its just not good for students at all if they want to do an after school activity it is there choice.		0
The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly evident in various parts of the world. In Germany, the community of Vauban has successfully implemented a car-free lifestyle, with only two places to park for the entire community. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars and 57 percent actually sold their cars to move there. The residents have reported feeling happier and less stressed without the need for a car. This experiment in low-car suburban life is being adopted in other parts of the world as well, as suburbs are being redesigned to be more compact and accessible to public transportation, with fewer spaces for parking. This trend is a response to the negative impact of cars on greenhouse gas emissions, as passenger cars contribute to 12 percent of emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. By limiting car usage, we can make significant progress in reducing pollution and combating climate change.  Another example of limiting car usage can be seen in the city of Paris, where driving was partially banned due to severe smog. The ban targeted vehicles with even-numbered or odd-numbered license plates on alternate days. The result was a significant decrease in congestion, with traffic levels decreasing by 60 percent. This demonstrates that reducing car usage can have a direct and immediate impact on air pollution. While there were some inconveniences for delivery companies, exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and vehicles with three or more passengers. The success of the ban shows that individuals are willing to adopt alternative modes of transportation when necessary.  Colombia has also implemented a car-free day in its capital city, Bogota, for three consecutive years. The goal of this initiative is to promote alternative transportation options and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians have participated in hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses to work, resulting in eerily empty streets. This program has not only been successful in Bogota but has also spread to other cities in Colombia and other countries as well. The event has attracted the attention of municipal authorities from around the world, as they witness the potential for a revolutionary change. This demonstrates that limiting car usage is not just a local phenomenon, but a global movement towards a more sustainable future.  The shift in American behavior towards limiting car usage is also becoming evident. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses each year. This decrease in driving is attributed to various factors, such as the recession and the rise of telecommuting and shared transportation. This cultural shift has positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is the second largest source of emissions in the United States. However, it could have negative implications for the car industry, as companies like Ford and Mercedes are rebranding themselves as "mobility" companies with a broader range of products beyond personal vehicles.  In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, decreases air pollution, and promotes a more sustainable and healthier lifestyle. The examples provided from Vauban, Paris, Bogota, and the United States demonstrate the potential for a widespread shift towards alternative transportation options. By implementing smart planning and creating communities that are less dependent on cars, we can create a better future for ourselves and for the planet.		1
Self-reliance is a concept that has been around for a long time, but it's more relevant now than ever. With all the craziness going on in the world, it's important to know how to take care of yourself and your community. I mean, think about it, if everyone was self-reliant, we wouldn't need government shutdowns or other nationwide issues.  So, what is self-reliance? It's basically being able to take care of yourself and your own needs without relying on others. It's like having a backup plan, you know? Like, if something goes wrong, you can fall back on your own abilities and resources instead of waiting for someone else to save you. And it's not just about being independent, it's also about being responsible and proactive.  Now, you might be thinking, "But isn't self-reliance just for survivalists and military people?" Nope! It's not just for those extreme cases. Self-reliance is for anyone who wants to be more prepared and in control of their own lives. Like, imagine if you had a power outage or a natural disaster, you could take care of yourself and your family without needing to rely on anyone else. That's the power of self-reliance!  But, let's be real, it's not always easy. It takes time and effort to become self-reliant, especially if you're not used to it. It's like, you gotta learn new skills and stuff, like how to grow your own food or fix your own car. But, it's worth it in the end, trust me.  So, how does self-reliance relate to leadership? Well, a leader who is self-reliant is more likely to make good decisions and take action when things go wrong. They're not gonna panic or rely on someone else to fix the problem, they're gonna take charge and do it themselves. And that's exactly what we need more of in our leaders, people who are self-reliant and can handle the tough stuff.  But, let's not forget about the military mindset. Some people might think that self-reliance is just like the military, where you have		1
 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a widely used tool in psychology and neuroscience to study and analyze facial expressions. It was developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a means to translate facial expressions into a quantifiable and scientific language. FACS is based on the idea that facial expressions are coded into specific combinations of muscle movements, which are then interpreted as different emotions or facial expressions.  The FACS system categorizes facial expressions into six basic action units, each of which involves a specific muscle movement or group of muscle movements. These action units can be combined to create more complex facial expressions, such as smiling, frowning, or raising eyebrows. For example, smiling involves activating the muscles around the eyes and mouth, while frowning involves contracting the muscles in the forehead and around the eyes.  FACS has been widely used in a variety of fields, including psychology, neurology, and psychology. It has been used to study emotional processing, cognitive processes, and social interactions. For example, studies have shown that FACS can be used to accurately predict emotions expressed during speech or text-based communication. It has also been used to analyze the facial expressions of individuals with neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease or autism.  Despite its many uses, FACS is not without its critics. Some have argued that FACS is too narrowly focused on specific muscle movements and does not account for context or cultural differences in facial expressions. Others have questioned the validity of FACS as a means of accurately measuring emotions or facial expressions.  Overall, FACS is a valuable tool for studying facial expressions and emotions. While it may not be perfect, it provides a standardized language for analyzing facial expressions and can be used in a variety of contexts to further our understanding of human emotions and social interactions.		1
 Exploring Venus  Venus, also known as Earth's sister planet, has long been a source of fascination for scientists, researchers, and space enthusiasts. As the closest planet to Earth, Venus has many similarities with our home planet. But there are also many differences that make exploring Venus a complex and challenging task.  One of the biggest challenges in exploring Venus is the extreme heat and pressure on its surface. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, with temperatures reaching up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which traps heat in Venus's atmosphere, leading to a runaway greenhouse effect. Additionally, the atmosphere of Venus is incredibly dense, with a pressure 92 times greater than on Earth's surface.  Despite these challenges, there have been several successful missions to explore Venus. One such mission was the Magellan spacecraft, which orbited Venus for over seven years and mapped over 100% of the planet's surface. The data collected by the Magellan spacecraft provided valuable insights into Venus's geography, atmosphere, and climate.  In 2019, NASA launched the Magellan 2 spacecraft to continue mapping Venus's surface. The spacecraft is a key component of the Venus Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (VAVENESS) mission, which aims to understand the climate of Venus and how it differs from Earth's.  Another exciting mission to explore Venus is the Veritas spacecraft, which is set to launch in 2022. The Veritas mission will investigate the geologic activity on Venus and explore the planet's deep interior. The spacecraft will use radar technology to map Venus's surface and study the planet's unique geology.  In addition to spacecraft, there are other ways to explore Venus. Scientists have investigated meteorites that have landed on Earth to learn more about the composition and geology of Venus's surface. These meteorites also provide insights into how Venus's atmosphere has evolved over time.  While there are still many challenges to exploring Venus, ongoing research and technology advancements continue to make it possible to learn more about this fascinating planet. By studying Venus, scientists can gain valuable insights into our own planet and its future.  In conclusion, exploring Venus is a challenging task due to its extreme heat, pressure, and dense atmosphere. However, with ongoing research and technology advancements, it is possible to learn more about this fascinating planet and its unique features. As we continue to explore Venus, we can gain valuable insights into our own planet and its future.		1
Boom the sound of ginourmous truck slamming into a house full of people , smoke everywere there's about to be a fire many people are unconcious or dead. More than half of the people in the house are rushed to the hospital. As you can see there has been an atrocious accident because of that vehicle. Their should definitley be a limiting of car usage because their would be less car accidents , people would be able to spend less money on cars and we would have less air pollution. Also having a car can cause a lot of stress or tension for people.  Obviously we're having a lot of problems with money in this world , if we limit car usage that would really help is us out a lot. See as it states in source one paragraph two '' A car-owner buys a space, for forty thousand dollars , along with a home.'' With those forty thousand dollars you can do a lot to help the world . It aslo says that fifty seven percent of the people who live in a suburban area sold their cars just move where they live at now. Who needs a car when you can just walk ''stores are placed a walk away, on a main street rather than the malls along some distant highway. ''source one paragraph 6.  Pollution is destroying our world and we need to help stop it, so here's an idea lets ban driving due to smog says Paris. Their was an enforced partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Do you agree with that? well I do and here's why . Paris has more smog than other European capitals so if they don't stop the smog it's going to be horrific for their city. Source three paragraph twenty one '' the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.'''Not having cars for one day is brilliant idea because is an improvement to the city of Bogota.  Their is a lot of disruptions an accidents going on because of cars mainly because of the traffic so if their was less cars it would be more peaceful. Usually when there's traffic you hear a lot honking and there's a lot fines for that. The fines are very expensive to pay so you're wasting a lot of money. Also when people are honking they don't realize that other people are sleeping . Everyone needs sleep , some people can't sleep through everything so all it takes is one honk and bam they're awake. Sleeping is really needed in your life imagine notgetting enough sleep because of traffic well yeah that would suck an a lot of people already go through that .  So in conclusion what I'm saying is car usage should definitly be limited at least in some countries or states. Money is a really big problem we have that needs to be solved and this is a great way. People living in a surburan area have to pay more just for extra parking places. Air pollution is very bad for the world with les cars that will stop as well. Traffic is not good for the world either because it is stressful an it is not good for people to be stressed.    		0
The "Face on Mars" may seem like is was created by aliens but it is just a coincidence that the landform looks just like a face. The "Face on Mars" is in fact just a mesa but with "unusual shadows that made it look like an Egytian Pharaoh". In my opinion,it may seem like a alien has created the face on Mars but I belive that such a thing as alien do not exist.  The picture of the face being in 1976 did not have good quality with the high technology we have today. So when Michael Malin and his MOS team took a photo of the face recently people were shocked to find out that the face is just a natural landform. Also, not many scientist belive that the face is a alien artifact either. The face on Mars is just a "huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."  The "Face on Mars" may seem like it was created by aliens but it was just a coincidence that the natural landform resembled a human face. The shadows around the face make the landform seem like it has a mouth, nose, and eyes but it is just a mesa. In conclusion, the face that was captured on a region on Mars, Cydonia, is in fact a natural landform and was not formed by aliens.		0
What comes to mind when you think about school? You tend to think of a big building, filled with other kids, that your parents made you go to when you were younger. Well now schooling has changed a bit. Some schools offer distance learning as a schooling option, however; many kids aren't getting the social interactions they need. With distance learning there are benefits and concerns.  First benefit of distance learning is you can learn at your own pace. School may be easier or harder depending on the subject and the person. With this being said, there is plenty of different ways students learn best. Whether¬†it is visionary learning, group work, textbooks, or even in the comfort of your own home.  Another good outcome of distance learning is there is less drama. In typical school, you are normally in a class with 15 to 30 other students. As a growing teenager, hormones are a powerful thing, especially in school. One day you get into an argument with your friend, next thing you know, the whole class is mad at you; regardless of knowing the full story. It is hard to deal with drama of your own, others drama, and school on top of everything else. Also, we tend to bring emotions and take our frustration out on people who don't deserve it; including teachers and other students.  Distance learning also has concerns of using too much technology, not interacting with peers, and missing out on school events. Schools have evolved with better and easier ways of learning; technology playing a large role. Although, typical schools limit technology usage in class. With distance learning you are using technology constantly. If you are at home attending classes, you are missing out on school events and interactions. There are dances, clubs, pep rallies, and sports to get involved with. There are just a few concerns with distance learning.  While most people have had only public school opportunities, schooling has advanced. Some schools have given students an option to learn by distance learning however; kids are not engaged in interactions with peers. With all this information given, I personally would consider distance learning. I encourage students and parents to try out distance learning.   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
Designing summer projects; students vs. teachers  Knowledge and learning are like metallic gears; once you stop using them, they will quickly start corroding. To keep students active in learning during their summer break, as to not let them forget their previous knowledge and keep exercising their brains, schools give summer assignments. These assignments and projects are quiet helpful, if given in ways interesting for students and to keep them dedicated towards learning. They can, however, become a burden if students do not find the projects suitable or interesting. So, students themselves should be allowed to design their summer projects as they will create projects fit for them, they will stay active for those projects and show interest to do them, they will actually complete their projects and learn something if the projects are designed and selected by themselves, and¬†this would help teachers by lessening workload for them too.  Some people suggest that teacher designed projects might be a better idea since they would create projects in a way to focus on areas they want students to learn and stay active in. But teachers do not know mindset of each individual students, nor do they know the brain mechanism of which method should be used to make students participate in learning efficiently. Thus it is better to allow students themselves to design their own projects to do in summers, according to what they like and how they want to study.  If students are allowed to design their own summer projects, they would actually create something that they would like to do. This would make sure they would participate in the learning and the actual process of the project itself. It is an efficient way to get students motivated and interested in summer projects, which they would otherwise ignore, drawn in by other activities that are more interesting for them. As a student myself, i would rather be more drawn to complete a project i made according to my interests, than a boring project that doesn't interest me and on which i would give up.  Letting students create their own projects would also in increase participation in summer projects. During summer, going on a trip with family, a student would never care to complete or even look at a summer project given from school. But if that student made the project themselves, they could have created something related to that trip they knew they would go on. That would ensure they brought the project along with them on the trip and did it too. So they had fun on the trip and completed the project as well, a win for all. Similarly, students would design their projects according to their activities, which would make them interested in actually doing the projects too.  If students design their own projects, it would take some burden off of teachers too; to plan, create and monitor assignments for students to do in summer. And if students still don't complete their summer work, teachers would get disheartened by their efforts not paying off. For example, if a teacher has to make tests for 4 quarters alongside class assignments, amongst other things, they would most likely pay little heed to create an interesting summer project that would appeal to students. Teachers would appreciate a little help in their otherwise extensive and restless work of making tests, quizzes, classwork, homework and monitoring students as well.  Lastly, if the summer projects are student designed, the rate of completion of these projects would also increase. As i have seen in classes, barely half the students complete given summer projects, and most make excuses as to why they didn't complete their work. This would change, if they themselves designed these assignments, as students would be more likely to complete projects they participated in making and invested time in designing themselves. This would ensure that they actually complete these assignments, instead of waiting out on them and then making excuses as to why they never got to completing them. My peers agreed that if they got to design their projects, they would be committed to them and would finish them too, not wanting to waste their efforts that they investing in creating that work.  In short, it is better to let students design their own summer projects as to keep them interested in these projects, increase participation rate and completion rate of summer work, while also possibly making them have fun while completing these assignments. I am sure teachers would appreciate some less burden of planning summer work too, while students would be more dedicated and invested in summer projects, which would be a win for all!		0
 The electoral college is a system used in the United States to elect the President of the country. Under this system, the President is not directly elected by the people, but by a group of electors who are chosen by each state's political party. This system has been in place since the founding of the country and has been the subject of much debate and criticism in recent years. In this essay, we will examine whether the electoral college works effectively in selecting the President of the United States.  One argument in favor of the electoral college is that it provides a fair representation of the country's population. Each state is allocated a number of electoral votes based on its population, which means that larger states have more influence on the outcome of the election than smaller states. This system ensures that the President is elected by the entire country, not just by densely populated urban areas.  Another argument in favor of the electoral college is that it helps to prevent a candidate from winning the presidency by relying solely on a few urban areas. This would effectively mean that the majority of the country has no say in who elected the President. By having a national system, it prevents a candidate from winning the presidency by focusing their campaign on a small group of states.  However, opponents of the electoral college argue that it does not accurately reflect the will of the people. In many cases, the candidate who wins the popular vote does not win the electoral vote, and vice versa. This can lead to a situation where a candidate who loses the popular vote but wins the electoral vote becomes President. This has happened in five U.S. presidential elections, including the 2000 and 2016 elections.  Another argument against the electoral college is that it can lead to a system in which candidates focus on winning states rather than winning the popular vote. This has led to candidates running divisive and negative campaigns in order to win over voters in key swing states. This has also led to the idea that candidates only pay attention to certain regions of the country, rather than the entire country.  In conclusion, the electoral college is a system used in the United States to elect the President of the country. While it has some advantages, such as providing a fair representation of the country's population, it also has some disadvantages, such as not accurately reflecting the will of the people. Ultimately, whether the electoral college works effectively in selecting the President of the United States is a matter of opinion, and it will continue to be a subject of debate and criticism in the future.		1
Last call  There was a phone that was able to be carried anywhere, but it was large, thick, and heavy. Later technologists invented the new phone small, less heavy and just the right size for one's hand which is easy to carry everywhere and fit in a pocket. Before this new design, there was not a lot of phone use in cars and not so many accidents. Years later, the most popular phone is the iPhone by Apple. Many people buy phones because they use social media, Bluetooth, the internet, and other apps. Several people become distracted when they receive messages or notifications while driving because they pick up the phone to answer it. Using cell phones while driving should be banned to help decrease accidents, deaths, and legal consequences. Opponents of banning cell phone use while driving believes it is not the only distraction to drivers. What we should do is produce new technologies that make the practice safer for everyone.  I agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents that happen on a daily bases. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences than they are with their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like the flu. Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation so, it is quite natural to see many people with them. Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles if one keeps talking on the phone consistently while driving.  Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc.  The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. Driving requires a great amount of concentration, judgment, and precision when you are using a cell phone your concentration is greatly shifted from the road to the cell phone. When texting or calling a call they are not looking at the road they are looking at their cell phone within that split second you are putting your life and somebody else's life in danger. Many car accidents in the U.S are caused by texting while driving. If they ban cell phone usage while driving, they could save millions of lives, they will be more graduations rather than funerals.                                        		0
Homework, a word that can bring dread to the hearts of students everywhere. Some people think it's super important for learning, while others think it's, like, totally stressful. Me? I'm somewhere in the middle.  First, let's talk about why homework can be good. It helps us practice what we learned in class, and that's important because it makes sure we don't forget it. Forgetting is bad, right? Like, imagine if you forgot how to do long division. You'd be like, "Uh, what's 24 divided by 3?" And then you'd be like, "Uh, um, uh..." And then you'd fail the test. Not good.  Also, homework can help us learn new things. Like, if we're learning about fractions, our homework might be to find pictures of fractions in real life. That's cool because it makes us think, like, "Oh, I get it now!" And then we understand it better. Understanding is good.  But, there's also some not-so-good things about homework. Some people, like me, get super stressed out about it. Like, sometimes I'm like, "I have so much homework, I don't know what to do!" And then I get a headache. Not fun.  Also, homework can take up a lot of time. Like, sometimes I have to work on it for, like, hours. And then I'm like, "Man, I wish I could be playing video games right now." But no, I'm stuck doing homework. That's no bueno.  So, what's the solution? I think we should have, like, some homework, but not too much. Like, maybe 30 minutes a night or something. That way, we can still practice and learn new things, but we won't be, like, totally stressed out.  In conclusion, homework can be good and bad. It's good because it helps us practice and learn new things, but it's bad because it can be stressful and take up too much time. So, we should have some homework, but not too much. That way, we can, like, learn stuff and still have time for fun things, like playing video games. Or, you know, hanging out with friends. That's important too.		1
The use of facial recognition technology like the Facial Action Coding System to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom is problematic and an invasion of privacy. While identifying students' emotions could provide teachers insights to better engage students, this technology comes with significant risks that outweigh the potential benefits.   Facial recognition tools are still imperfect and run the risk of misreading students' emotions or falsely identifying expressions. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing their facial expressions and private emotions are being monitored and analyzed without their consent. This could undermine feelings of trust in the learning environment. Students should feel free to openly think and process new ideas without constant monitoring of their emotional reactions.   Teachers also may misinterpret what facial expressions actually represent about a student's level of engagement, interest, or understanding. A bored expression does necessarily mean a student is not understanding the material - they could just be tired that day. Relying too heavily on these tools risks shallow evaluations of learning that do not consider each student's full circumstances or abilities.   Identification of emotions also does not tell teachers the root cause that led to an emotion. Students may feel stressed for reasons completely unrelated to the lesson, like issues at home. Without context, emotional profiling provides an incomplete picture and may lead to incorrect assumptions.   Finally, widespread use of this technology raises serious privacy concerns. Data collected on students' facial expressions and emotional profiling could be vulnerable to data breaches or misuse over time in ways that negatively impact students. Both students and parents deserve a say in how private student data is collected and used in the classroom.  In conclusion, while tools like facial recognition may provide some insights, the risks to student privacy and learning dynamics outweigh the potential value in a classroom context. Technologies should seek students' consent and not undermine important conditions for learning like trust, critical thought and self-determination. Strong privacy protections and appropriate oversight are necessary to justify widespread use of emotional tracking tools in schools.		1
 The Electoral College is a system used by the United States to determine who will serve as the President and Vice President of the country. While it has been in place since the country's founding, some argue that it is no longer effective or representative of the people. In this essay, we will examine the pros and cons of the Electoral College and determine whether it continues to work as intended.  One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it gives equal weight to each state. This means that smaller states have the same amount of representation as larger states, allowing for every voice to be heard. In addition, the Electoral College helps to prevent candidate campaigning in just a few large urban areas and encourages them to appeal to a wider audience. This is beneficial because it ensures that the election is not solely focused on a few major cities, but rather takes into account the needs and interests of the entire country.  However, there are also arguments against the Electoral College. One of the main issues is that it can be out of touch with the will of the people. In some cases, a candidate may win the popular vote by several million votes, but still lose the election because they did not win enough electoral votes. This can be seen as unfair, especially because it could potentially mean that a candidate who does not have the support of the majority of the American people is chosen as President.  Another argument against the Electoral College is that it tends to favor urban areas and ignore rural areas. Because candidates focus on winning over large, densely populated cities, they may overlook rural areas and negatively impact smaller towns, farms, and suburbs. This can lead to a candidate being elected who does not have the support of the majority of Americans, as they may have dominated in urban areas while failing to gain significant support in rural areas.  In conclusion, the Electoral College is a system used by the United States to determine the President and Vice President. While it has its benefits, there are also its drawbacks. While it is true that every voice is heard and urban and rural areas are not ignored, it is also true that it can be out of touch with the will of the people and can lead to candidates ignoring certain groups of Americans. Whether the Electoral College continues to work as intended is a matter of debate, but it is clear that it has some significant limitations that must be addressed.		1
Extracurriculars  Is it okay to make every student participate in an after school? Things like sports, clubs, or student council.  Although other people might think that't a great idea the answer¬†is no. Forcing students to do an extracurricular is not okay even if said by the principle. Some reasons are that the student might not have time, they¬†have siblings to take care of, or they might not want to first off students might not have the time to participate in after school activities. Some students have lessons outside school that are paid for by their parents. There could be students who have a lot¬†of homework and extracurriculars¬†could give them less time to do it. They might have a part time job that needs them to come right after school. Students don't always have as much time as the school thinks they have.  Secondly if students have siblings in elementary school and they're in junior high or high school than they might need to be there when their siblings get home from school. They may need to take care of them or make sure the house doesn't¬†burn down. Maybe they have sick family to take care of after school. They could have chores to do when they get home. There are more things that students need to do when they get home than the school thinks.  Lastly they might just not want to do after school activities. Students spend 40 hours a week in school and who is to say (except for their parents)  what they have to do with the rest of their time. What if they want to have time to hang out with their friends out side of school. And I know that you might say that they could hang out with their friends¬†while doing the extracurricular but that's not what they want to do. What if their friends don't go to their school? How would they get enough time to hang out. Students have lives out side of school.  Should schools force students to do an after school activity? NO! It would be okay to encourage that kind of thing but it should not be mandatory. Schools don't always know their situation and when the school day is over, it's over. School can't make them do anything after that because it's not school time any more. It is not okay to make students do after school activitys, I rest my case.		0
TEACHER_NAME,  Not all students can maintain a B average. If you change the school policy. You will probably have less Extra Curricular activities and less students wanting to come to Everglades High. The football team will probably have to quit knowing that you will not accept any other grades. Plus, not all teacher faculty curves grades. I'm not even able to keep up a B average all the time. Most parents cannot pay money for a tutor. Tutoring isn't cheap. So, you might want to think twice before you change the policy. It would also mean less sports agents coming to the school. Even if they are here to see students that are keeping up the average.  Most children come to your school because of the sports and other multiple activities in your school. If you take it away nobody would be coming here cause they want to. But, because there forced to. Kids need freedom and most of theirs are the schools activities. Taking that away would be like taking away their future, passion, and hope. It helps them keep believing in things. Even if that thing is maintaining a C average. Think twice before you get laid off. It's probably not everyday that someone is trying to tell you how and when to do the right thing or job. But, I am telling you now, and like it is. Minors will be miserable knowing that they get kicked off a team for a C. Then everybody would give up hope on you too.  TEACHER_NAME, Don't change the policy because you think it's right. You should be thinking about who's life your going to mess up. If you make the policy to the point were everybody needs a B. Nobody is going to have a passion anymore. Weather it's art, football, cheer leading, or Chess club. It's what their life reflects on.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME      		0
"The more the merrier" is an iconic quote that nearly everyone has either used or heard in person. Now, this quote could refer to anything; more cats, more dogs, more trumpets, or more frogs. In this case, the quote is referring to the number of people advice is taken from. Sure, one person could give outstanding advice, but diversified perspectives are always helpful. Such perspectives are helpful in many ways, like how receiving multiple perspectives gives you more solutions to a problem, you can avoid possible bias from advice-givers, and multiple pieces of advice could build on each other to build a stronger, more effective solution.  When receiving diversified advice, you get many new solutions to the problem at hand, which is often very beneficial. For example, you're the quarterback of your football team and one of your teammates (a wide receiver) is advising you to launch the ball down the field to them. If you had only listened to this one piece of advice and chucked the ball down the field, the odds of you throwing an interception and having an angry coach would have been very high. The opposite could have been said if you would've taken advice from multiple people to rule out one person's bad advice and gave yourself a higher chance of a more favorable outcome. Another example of this would be if you were getting chased by an alligator. Let's say 3 or 4 of your friends had said to just run as fast as you could and hope for the best when you were discussing this a few weeks ago, and a few adults, including your parents, told you to run in a zig-zag pattern because alligators are much less agile on land than in the water. You started off by following the advice of your friends, but quickly notice that the alligator is gaining on you, so you desperately switch to plan "b" and begin to run in zig-zags. The alligator gives up and returns to the lake. Had you limited yourself to one perspective, you would've ended up as a headline on CNN, but since you had multiple perspectives in the back of your mind, you were able to fall back on that previously stated "plan b" and make it out with your life.  When receiving advice from someone, you may also be receiving bias towards something that affects them personally, which can be ruled out by receiving multiple perspectives. Additionally, one person may feel a strong way for or against the topic that you're wanting advice on, so having multiple perspectives on a topic will rule out that first person's biased advise, whether it was intentional or not. For example, you might be thinking about playing football (American Football) in high school, but one person begins to change your mind because they start giving you a whole bunch of one-sided, exaggerated stories about injuries caused by football, simply because they don't like the sport. Although you agree that the sport can be dangerous, you decide to get some different views on it. You go and talk to the head coach of the team, and he tells you that these injuries can be easily avoided with proper technique, mature decisions, rather than recklessness. You go to your parents as one final source of advice, knowing that they'll be neutral and unbiased. Upon receiving all of this advice, you can then make a well-informed decision on what and what not to do because you can detect the bias in the advice, now that it would act as an outlier in a larger collection.  Multiple different perspectives on an issue or problem can be combined to build a stronger, more effective and efficient solution. This is not to say that all individual solutions are completely ineffective and useless on their own, but rather to say that when they do come up short on their own, they can be combined to generate a better, more effective solution. Take the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s as an example. There were many influential activists such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and John Lewis that provided efficient, nonviolent solutions to try and end the racist descrimination that had held them down for so many centuries. These ideas were combined and formed the Civil Rights Movement that, after 14 years, resulted in success. Another example of such combination would be the millions of people working against global warming. Many people and organizations are starting to bring their ideas and perspectives together to combat what is turning out to be, arguably, one of the most important issues that humanity has ever faced. No matter how good the solution is, no one solution could solve a problem of such a magnitude.  Rather, a large chain of solutions cooperating with each other would be needed. This is because the reason the issue has grown to such a large size is because it is made up of many smaller issues.  Diversity in perspective is greatly important because it gives you multiple solutions to a problem, eliminates the bias of a few people, and can be combined to former a stronger, more effective solution. If one was to only take one proposed solution, they may be left stranded if that solution doesn't work with no secondary option to fall back upon. Furthermore, there are often biased advice-givers who can mislead someone looking for genuine advice. Getting a larger amount of perspectives will push that outlying bias to the surface and allow you to avoid it. On the other hand, some strategies may not be effective enough or simply ineffective¬†on their own, but can form a better solution when combined with each other. All in all, advice is always more useful in a greater collection size, rather than coming from just one source that may or may not be biased. "The more the merrier."		0
Hey, so I'm totally stoked to be writing this essay about how to spice up the lunch menu in our school cafeteria! üçîü•§ Like, let's be real, the same old burgers and pizza every day can get super old and boring. I mean, I love a good slice of pizza as much as the next person, but variety is key, you know? ü§î  So, here are some ideas for new lunch menu options that could be added three times a week to mix things up:  1. Fresh fruit smoothies! üçìü•≠ I know, I know, it's not exactly a new idea, but it's so easy and healthy! And think about it, it's a great way to get some extra veggies into our diets.

I thing more people should join in the Seagoing Cowboy program because we get to visit diffrent places and help people out witch always makes me fell better about myself and it makes that person you are working for happy too.  There is also an unbelievable opportunity of a small-town boy, or antone who wants to join and has a little expereance with animals. I had the benifit of seeing Europe and China. I also got to see the Acropolis in Greece witch was realy cool.  Traveling the hight seas was hard sometimes but i got over it. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. But caing for the animals kept me busy, they had to be fed and watered three times a day. But there are also other jobs you could work.  The fun things you could do on board is play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed, but the only way you could play is after you have returning from trips after the animals had been unloaded.  So i hope that after you have read this you are thinking adout wether you should do this or not. I personaly think you should do this because it is sometimes fun and diffrent and not everyone has this opportunity. But make sure that you ask your parents first before you go sailing off without them knowing were you are at or going, that would be bad and you dont want that to happen. I hope to see you here next year.		0
Dear Senator, The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The system has been around for millenniums from our founding fathers and the Constitution in the 1700s to present day America, it is critical that we update our system to a more realistic process where the citizens have more say in the leader we choose to lead us. I am in favor in abolishing the Electoral College because most of the power should be held in the hand of the citizens and the popular vote should have more regards than the vote in Congress. I am not in favor in keeping the Electoral College because under the college system, voters don't vote for the president but for a slate elector, who in turn "elect the president", the process is unfair to voters, and over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election rather than the kind we have now.  When people go out of thier way to vote, they vote because they want to have a say in their potentially future. They vote for who they believe would lead our society and modern day world in the right direction. They would like to think that one vote could make a difference in a election, but with the Electoral College voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than vote who they actually want to be president. Under the Electoral College voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. In reality the people are not voting for the president they are putting their trust in somebody they vote to vote for the person they have choose to lead. Democrats in Texas for example knowing their vote will have no effect in the election they become less interested in the campaign than they would if the president was choosen directly by popular votes and that is unfair to the people.  The process is unfair to the people because of the "winner takes all" system in each state the candidates dont take time in states in which they know have no chances of gaining them any power, they stay in states that are more genetically to them. The candidates mostly focus on the tight races curing in the "swing states" in 2000 many states didnt even get to see the candidates because they were "little, irrelevant, and worthless" states. I'm sure many people in those states such as South Carolina and Rhode Island had a lot of input to add in the 2000 campaign but because they were little minority states they werent focused on as much as the other larger states. This is very unfair and judgemental to these states because the Electoral College is based on involuntary effects, the inhabitants of North carolina or Rhode Island cannot control where they choose to live, they might have to live in the certain geograpic location because of finaces or religous persecution. They may want to have a say in the election but cant because of their living arrangements.  Many might contradict that the Electoral College is benefical because it has more of a certain outcome but with that certainty comes many votes and state votes that were disregarded. The Electoral College is unfair in many different aspects we need to update our system of election, because like everything else in the world has an expiration date. Their is an expiration date on almost all of our food and beverages, an expiration date on salvery, an expiration date on our life, and so now we need an expiration date on the Electoral College.		0
Cell phones are a good way to contact parents after school but that's not always the case. Cell phone users usually have there phones on during school and they get easily distracted. Students usually take out the phone in class and start texting. I don't think students should even have cell phones at all especially in school grounds. Students take out there phone in class and start texting while their teacher is giving the lesson. This makes students miss what they had to learn for the day. Along come test days and they didn't study, didn't rest, didn't pay attention and all for what? To text there friends.  What usually occurs is that they just text some other friend to ask them the answers to the test. These type of students are failing classes just to text their friends or even their boyfriends. They have not yet realized the importance of education. I used to have a phone myself and i got caught texting in class, and i noticed that my grades started to go down. One day i also got caught having inappropriate pictures on my phone and so i got fined for that. When i had a phone those were the worst days of my life.  Now i don't have a phone and my grades are great, I'm doing fine on tests and i don't get into trouble as much as i used to. School is very important, and we are very lucky that we get an education for free, and therefore we need to take advantage of that. So that way we can create a great future.      		0
Limiting Car Usage: Advantages for Citizens and Communities  There are a number of compelling advantages to limiting car usage, both for individuals and the communities in which we live. Reducing our reliance on personal vehicles can have wide-ranging environmental, health, social and economic benefits.   To begin with, curbing car use is positive for the environment. Automobiles are major contributors to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. When fewer vehicles are on the road each day, there is less carbon emitted into the atmosphere and cleaner air for all to breathe. Several studies have found direct correlations between lower vehicle traffic and decreased levels of smog, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter (Source 1). With less pollution, plant and animal life face fewer stressors.  In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car trips improves public health. Walking or biking as alternatives to driving results in more physical activity for individuals. Regular exercise reduces risks for many chronic diseases and helps manage weight (Source 2). Furthermore, studies show communities with robust networks for walking and cycling report higher well-being among residents (Source 3). Reduced automobile emissions also mean less respiratory issues from poor air quality. A healthier population means lower healthcare costs over the long run.   Socially, having reliable options besides private cars fosters stronger community bonds. Public spaces become more usable and appealing for socializing when they are less dominated by vehicles. With fewer cars on the road during peak times, neighborhoods feel safer and more accommodating for children and elderly to navigate (Source 2). A sense of community is invaluable to quality of life.   Finally, limiting individual car ownership yields financial benefits. Beyond health and environmental savings, households spend less on car payments, insurance, maintenance and fuel each month. This extra income can be redirected to other pursuits that further enhance standard of living. For municipalities, fewer roads need constructing and repairing, freeing funds for schools, parks and other community amenities that unite residents.  In summary, curbing excessive car usage through alternative transit strategies leads to tangible advantages across many spheres - from environmental preservation and public health to social well-being and household finances. A multipronged effort of infrastructural changes, policy initiatives and cultural shifts could realize these collective gains that uplift both individuals and the greater community at large. Thoughtful limitations on car dependence hold great promise for sustainability and quality of life into the future.		1
Senator [Your Senator's Name],  I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to share my perspective on the ongoing national debate regarding the U.S. Presidential election process  ?specifically, the issue of whether we should retain the Electoral College or shift towards a direct popular vote system. Weighing the expert views from the Office of the Federal Register, Bradford Plumer, and Judge Richard A. Posner, I advocate for maintaining the Electoral College system.  The Electoral College, as outlined by the Office of the Federal Register, may not be perfectly democratic by modern definitions, as voters indirectly elect President and Vice President through electors (1-2, 15). This system, however, promotes certainty and decisiveness in election outcomes as noted by Judge Richard A. Posner. It invariably allows the electorally victorious candidate to hold a larger share of the Electoral College than their share of the popular vote, lessening the likelihood of disputed results (18). The system discourages run-off elections, reducing further intricacy in the already complex election process. Apart from practical reasons, the Electoral College helps ensure that the chosen president has appeal across various regions and caters to the interests of diverse populations (19).  That said, I acknowledge the ‚Äúdisaster factor ?argument posed by Bradford Plumer  ?that electors may occasionally go against popular preferences, or that disputed results like that of 2000 could shake public faith in the process (11). However, as Judge Richard A. Posner pointed out, these occurrences are infrequent, with the 2000 instance being the first electoral-popular vote discrepancy since 1888 (16).  Critics also argue that the Electoral College amplifies the influence of swing states, leading candidates to focus their campaigns on these regions and potentially neglect others (13,20). However, swing states ?unpredictability turns them into microcosms reflecting a broad range of American political opinions, thus requiring a more balanced, nuanced campaign strategy to win. While some assert that the system discourages voters in states dominated by a single party, we observe about half of the eligible American population voting, suggesting a desire to express political preferences despite perceived local electoral futility (23).  Finally, we must remember that our founding fathers conceived the Electoral College as a compromise between Congress directly electing a president and widespread popular vote. This balance endures, allowing citizens ?voices to be heard while simultaneously ensuring stable, conclusive electoral results, and preventing a select few populous regions from dominating our diverse nation's political discourse.  I urge you to consider these points during discussions concerning potential electoral reform. I believe maintaining the Electoral College is presently the best choice for our country.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  Sincerely, [Your Name] [Your Contact Information]		1
In many places like Bogota, Colombia and Paris, France there are many advantages to not using cars because:first, it would "promote alternate transportation..." and "devoid traffic jams", and second, it would help to "...reduce smog."  To begin with,according to Source 3: Car-free day spinning into a big hit in Bogota states that "It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted..." because the Bogota leaders wanted to reduce traffic jams and promote alternative transportation. This is a great advantage because by reducing traffic jams and promoting alternative transportation, you are decreasing the number of death by car accidents and helping people with the choices of other transpotation methods.  In addition, according to Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog, it states that "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."This ban was a huge advantage because in the article it states that, "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..." and that thanks to the ban, "The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."  In conclusion, The bans stated in Source 2 and in  Source 3 have advantages because they will "...reduce smog", "promote alternative transportation..." and "devoid traffic jams."    		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.  The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that gives more power to some voters than others. In a national popular vote, every vote would count equally, and the candidate with the most votes would win. This would be more fair to all voters and would ensure that the President is elected by the people, not by a handful of electors.  There are many reasons why the Electoral College is no longer necessary. When the Constitution was written, the United States was a much smaller country with limited communication and transportation. As a result, it was difficult for voters in different parts of the country to learn about the candidates and cast their votes. The Electoral College was designed to solve this problem by allowing each state to appoint electors who would then vote for President.  However, this system is no longer necessary. Today, voters can easily learn about the candidates and cast their votes by mail or in person. In addition, communication and transportation have improved so much that it is now possible for all voters to have a voice in the election.  The Electoral College also gives more power to some voters than others. In a national popular vote, every vote would count equally. However, in the Electoral College, a voter in a small state has more power than a voter in a large state. This is because each state has a certain number of electoral votes, regardless of its population. For example, Wyoming has 3 electoral votes, while California has 55. This means that a voter in Wyoming has about 3.6 times as much power as a voter in California.  The Electoral College also leads to candidates focusing on a few swing states, and ignoring the rest of the country. This is because the candidate who wins the most electoral votes wins the election, even if they do not win the popular vote. As a result, candidates only need to focus on winning the electoral votes in a few swing states, and they can ignore the rest of the country. This is undemocratic, and it prevents candidates from focusing on the needs of all voters.  In conclusion, the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that gives more power to some voters than others. It is time to abolish the Electoral College and elect the President of the United States by popular vote.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your name]		1
When considering whether to ask one person or multiple people for advice, there are several pros and cons to consider. Asking one person means that individual is likely more familiar with the situation and may be better able to provide specific, detailed advice. Quoting John C. Maxwell: ‚ÄúWhen I need to make a tough decision, I usually ask one wise person I trust. ?On the other hand, asking multiple people for advice can provide a variety of perspectives and insights. As the saying goes, ‚ÄúTwo heads are better than one. ?Personal anecdotes can also be useful; For example, one person might have asked advice from three friends and found that taking a combination of all their advice was more effective than following any one of them exclusively.   Overall, I believe that asking one person for advice is the most beneficial. It allows for a more personal and detailed understanding of the situation and potential best course of action. Additionally, the expertise of one trusted individual can often be more reliable than the general consensus of multiple people.		1
For centuries, students have endured the same rigorous schedule of school.  Five days a week for seven hours, with only two days of rest. Students have been told that school can be perceived¬†a safe haven where one can escape their challenges at home and have a comfortable place to learn and be with friends.  However, in recent times this has been proven difficult due to the adversity that students face in a school setting from bullying to a fear of ones safety.  Therefore, allowing students to attend online classes is beneficial because students can escape the burden of bullying, take care of their mental health, and feel comfortable in their learning environment.  Bullying has become a major issues in schools.  Modern media generally illustrates bullying as a physical concept as in fighting, but through through social media, a new type of bullying has risen known as cyber-bullying.  This has allowed individuals to sit behind a screen, hiding their identity, to target other users by commenting or posting cruel things.  When an individual is bullied, it not only affects their life at home but also school.  Therefore, giving students the option to take online classes can serve those who are bullied by not allowing them to feel targeted the moment they step foot in a school.  Although, schools have attempted to implement change to stop bullying, it is apparent that it is an aspect of life that will sadly be difficult to make disappear.  Without the option of online schooling, it teaches students who face bullying that they must endure the trauma and there is no escaping the cruelty in a school setting.  Schools must take a stand for those who are bullied and notice the positive impact that online schooling can have on an individual contributing to them no longer be treated as inferior by another person and finally discovering their self worth.  From kindergarten to senior year, students are discovering who they are.  This is a fragile time period for an individual because one begins to from relationships and learn whats makes them happy.  A major aspect of being happy is mental health.  However, school has become a burden on ones mental health by overloading students with an immense amount of stress.  For example, students have been told that their success is primarily based upon a grading¬†scale.  One must have a 4.0 grade point average and be involved in every club to reach the ultimate taught goal of getting into college.  This idea of success has caused students to forget the importance of their mental health and allow stress and anxiety to quickly dissolve ones healthy living. The option of online schooling can effectively¬†ensure that an individual is able to keep their mental health under control by relieving the pressure of a school setting.  Anxiety plays a major role in ones testing ability.  A school environment can place more pressure on a student to not only please themselves, but also their teacher.  The atmosphere of a school may enhance the¬†learning abilities of one individual, but to another can have detrimental impact on ones mental health leading to major long-term effects.  At home schooling, can help stop the epidemic of the increase in mental health issues in students, such as depression and anxiety, by giving them the opportunity to be in an environment that accommodates to their learning style.  Lastly, a student should be able to consider their school as if it is a second home.  However, after the 2017 tragedy at Parkland high school in Florida that led to the death of 17 students and left many injured this became very difficult.  After the¬†devastation¬†at¬†Parkland, it sparked the fear of ones safety at school that would ultimately haunt students until they graduate.  The most important aspect of school should be that students feel safe. With online schooling it can allow those students with a fear to be comfortable in their environment and not constantly worry for their life.  Another reason online schooling would benefit students, is due to the issue of overcrowding in many schools.  For example, Generic_School in Generic_City has a major issue of overcrowding.  As students walk through the hallway, their is a swarm of people that make it very difficult to walk comfortably through the halls.  Schooling at home can leaven the overcrowding of schools and create a more pleasant atmosphere.  Furthermore, schools would not have to use numerous trailers¬†in order¬†to accommodate to all students.  Online schooling can allow students to not only feel more safe, but also stray from feeling claustrophobic in schools that are overcrowded.  To achieve success one must feel that they can learn and prosper in a place that best fits their needs.  A school environment does not always accommodate to certain individuals.  With the option of at home schooling it can positively benefit students by allowing an individual to stray from bullying, work on their mental health, and feel safe.  The needs of a student should be the most important concept to those of higher power in schooling staff.  If a student feels that they will thrive with at home schooling, then why prevent these students from reaching maximum potential.  Online schooling is not for everyone, but it can guide those who may be struggling by giving them an alternate option to achieve success.		0
Always Seek Different Opinions  When it comes to decision making, people aren't always the best at it. When people are facing problems and have to make a decision, they normally just ask one or two people's opinions other than their own and just go with what that person said. Is that really the best way to handle that situation? It is the worst way to react way to the problem other than just thinking about your own opinion. When making a choice, you should always seek many different people's opinions. Those people may have different points of view, may know something others don't know, or may have actually experienced what your facing. Therefore, never just seek one opinion, but seek many different ones.  Before you make a choice, always ask different people for their opinions because they may have different points of view. Let's say a new school is being made and they are trying to decide if they should force students to wear uniforms. The pricipal thinks that uniforms would be good in school because of the professionalism in the looks of the uniforms. The principal of the school asks many people's opinions on what he should do. The people he asked had different body sizes, such as big and small. Often, uniforms are made for a specific body size. The bigger people said they thought uniforms should not be required because the uniform was specifically made for slim or skinny people. Having small clothes that make you uncomfortable make it hard to concentrate to work. The smaller people said that uniforms should be required because when they attended school, the uniforms made them look good and work efficiently. Different points of view makes very different opinions.  Even if you think that you have made up your mind on what you want to do, always ask other's opinions because they may know something that you may not have actually known. For example, let's say Generic_Name just graduated high school and is looking for where he wants to go for college. He has his mind set for College A but wants to ask his family for their opinions. He thinks College A is great because there is a soccer team he can try out for and that he can get a schollarship. His family tells him that he is correct but College A doesn't have a good learning program. That means that he would have a problem later on about finding a job after college. His family then reccomend for him to go to College B because it is closer to home, has a good learning program, and has a soccer team. He didn't relize how good College B was and decided to apply for College B after the conversation with his family. You may think you know all the facts but always ask for other opinions because you might learn something.  Let's just say you and your family are trying to plan a trip but can't decide where to go. Asking different people's reccomendations will help a whole lot. The people you are asking most likely have experience with the place they suggested. For examle, if one person reccomended going to a beach, they would give different reasons to go to that beach. You could compare different people's opinions and reasons to make a final decision on where to go. Other people's experience will make your decision easier to make.  When it comes to decision making, people aren't always the best at it. Normally, the person just thinks of their own opinion and maybe one other and just goes with what they said. When trying to decide on something, always ask for different people's opinions. Opinions differ from point of view, weither you know something someone else doesn't, and by experience. Therefore, whenever you face a problem, never just seek one opinion, but seek many different ones.¬†¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†		0
In the passage Making Mona Lisa Smile they talk about a new technology called Facs. This stands for Facial Action Coding System. I am for this technology because it would be pretty cool to see other peoples facial expressions with this new techonology.  Fore example, if we used this on other studants in the class you could tell what expression is on there face even if the just look like they are happy. Secondly, it would be helpful because if someone is having a rough day but is not showning it with there facial expression you could use this device and talk to them and make them feel better. Lastly, it could be helpful because the kids would get to experience something cool that they have never seen before.  Secondly, the groupe of studants could use it for a project to have fun and use it on the studants that are in there groupe. On the other hand, studants could do different facial expressions to see what kind of facial expression comes out like if they are happy, sad, mad, or neutral. Another positive reason is that your home PC is not able to do anything like this so it is a new experience for everyone. Lastly, I think that the studants from all ages would like to do this because nobody has ever experienced this before.  Lastly, I think that this would be fun to use because it would be a great experience. Fore example, you could use it on your friends or they could possibly use it on you. Secondly, you could try different faces to see what kind of facial expressions you can receive. Lastly you could use it to see if somene is mad or you could use it on famous pantings to see what the picture givs back in facial expressions.  In conclusion this new techonology called Facial Action Coding System (FACS) could be used in every day life. Secondly, you could use it around your town or city and be able to gelp someone out if they are feeling down. Lastly i think this would be good techonology to use in every day life because you could help a lot of people in need with just one face scan. All in all, this techonology could get even more advanced and will probably be abled to detect more than just facial expressiosn.                         		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I Think that students shouldn't be required to do community service. They should be allowed to choose whether or not they want to. Some students don't have enough time on their schedules to help out , because of sports or other extracurricular activities. A second reason would be because they already help out at home with younger siblings and their parents. Most of the time they barely have enough time to do their homework.  Students should be able to choose for themselves not have someone dictate what they do after or during school. The time it would take to do community service would be depriving students of their education. I don't think we need any uneducated generations to form. Isn't community service for those who have done wrong to the community anyways? Do you want people to think that we have a school filled with convicts, or juvenile delinquents?  I wouldn't want anyone to think that about my school. That is why i believe we shouldn't be required to do community service. We should have freedom to choose what we want to do, just like the constitution says " life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an "action unit." Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). He has classified six basic emotions - happiness,suprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness each characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raise your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris(around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an efective human instructor." The same technology can make computer -animatedfaces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. Muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. I belive it can read your emotional expressions better than a average human can because it can scan your face and see what your emotion is even if you pretend to be happy and your not. I think its a great creation soon everyone will use it and believe to.		0
Untill now we have never had a very clear picture of what is exactly that thing is. With the new high-resolution images the give us a better idea of what we are looking at. What this face on Mars is acually ia A mesa.  This human like face is nearly to miles in length and seems to be staring back at the camera. NASA was using the face on Mars to attract attention to Mars. While some say that the Face is bona fide evidence of life that NASA would rather hide. Defenders of NASA say that they wish there was an ancient civilzation. If there happened to be an acient civilzation on Mars just think about all to stuff that scientist could learn from Mars that could help describe all of the other planets.  The picture captured by Global Surveyor was ten times sharper than any of the other pictures ever taken. As the world saw this picture for the first time revealing a natural landform and that there was not alien monument after all. Some still belive that the face on Mars is an acient alien civilzation, but proven by scientist this Face is just a natural lanformation.		0
You ever buy something you want as soon as you see it and you regret¬†it later. While to many people impulse buying is fun. Compared to others who ask for others help on a decision so they dont regret it. when people ask for help they get more than one point of view on their decision to make. Also they have that information that others brought up, so the next time they are buying something similar they can think back to that.  I had this old bike where my knees touched the handle bars and the seat would move around on. When I was saving for a new bike I wanted a nice one I saved for a year and a half. I had all that time to ask my parents as well as my friends if a new bike would be a good idea. They convinced me that a new bike would be a good option and i'm happy with it. In other words listening to others may help you get to a decision you were unsure with.  Another reason is in the future when you are saving for another thing . You can use your prior knowledge to help sway your decision. On whether to buy the thing you want or not. I personally used this on my trip in new York when I was buying a gift for my brother. So using prior knowledge form others can help you get to a decision.  while buying things from a rubber ducky to a bike can is fun its always good to check what others think so you dont regret it later. thank you for reading my essay on consulting others before buying something is a good idea.		0
Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! üòÖ For my essay, I'm gonna analyze whether cell phones should be allowed in the classroom for educational purposes. üì±üìö  First off, let's talk about the pros of using cell phones in class. üìù One major advantage is that it can help students learn new things quickly. With just a quick Google search, they can find answers to questions they might be stuck on in class. Plus, they can access educational apps that can make learning more fun and interactive. üéÆüë©‚Äç ?  Another pro is that it can help students stay organized. They can use their phones to keep track of assignments, due dates, and even study materials for tests. It's like having a personal digital planner! üìÖüìù  Now, let's talk about the cons of using cell phones in class. üòï One major con is that it can be a distraction. Students might get too caught up in scrolling through social media or playing games, and forget about what's going on in class. üì±üëÄ It can also be hard to focus when there are so many notifications and alerts coming in. üìûüò©  Another con is that it can be a privacy issue. Students might use their phones to cheat or look up answers without permission. ü§îüëÄ It's important for teachers to make sure students are using their phones responsibly and following the classroom rules. üìöüë®‚Äç ?  So, how do cell phones compare to computer use? ü§î Well, computers are definitely more powerful and can handle more complex tasks. Students can use computers to work on bigger projects and do more in-depth research. üíªüîç However, computers can also be distracting, especially if students start browsing the internet for non-academic stuff. üòÖüëÄ  In conclusion, allowing students to use cell phones in the classroom can have both pros and cons.		1
In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This trend is driven by a number of factors, including the high cost of owning and operating a car, the growing environmental impact of car emissions, and the increasing congestion on our roads.  There are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. First, it can save you money. The average American spends over $8,000 per year on car ownership and operating costs. This includes the cost of the car itself, insurance, gas, and maintenance. If you live in a city with good public transportation, you can save a lot of money by walking, biking, taking public transportation, or carpooling instead of driving.  Second, limiting car usage can help to reduce your carbon footprint. Cars are one of the leading sources of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. If you can walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving, you can help to reduce your impact on the environment.  Third, limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion. Our roads are becoming increasingly congested, and this can make it difficult to get around. If you can walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving, you can help to reduce congestion and make it easier for everyone to get around.  Finally, limiting car usage can improve your health. Sitting in traffic for long periods of time can be harmful to your health. It can increase your risk of obesity, heart disease, and stroke. If you can walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving, you can get more exercise and improve your overall health.  There are a number of things that you can do to limit your car usage. One option is to live in a neighborhood that is close to your work, school, and other destinations. This will make it easier to walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving. Another option is to join a carpool or ride-sharing program. This can help you to save money and reduce your impact on the environment. Finally, you can try to walk, bike, or take public transportation whenever possible. This may take some planning and effort, but it can be a great way to save money, reduce your carbon footprint, and improve your health.  In conclusion, there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. It can save you money, reduce your carbon footprint, reduce traffic congestion, and improve your health. There are a number of things that you can do to limit your car usage, such as living in a walkable neighborhood, joining a carpool or ride-sharing program, or trying to walk, bike, or take public transportation whenever possible.		1
Dear Principal,  We the students of SCHOOL_NAME should be able to pick if we want to have community service. If students hear don't want to do community service then we should not have to. You are the principal and why should we have to do something that we don't want to do. Ask yourself that if you did not want to do something while you where a kid then why should you make us do it?  As students we should agree or disagree with your opinions and if we don't like what you say we have the right to object it. So if you want to make new rules then we the students should really have a say into that. What if some stude  Yes community service would be nice but the reality is that people these days are very LAZY so we should have a choice on what we do after school. So we should know madder what we should have a choice. So if we the students don't want to do anything, but just go home an play video games and eat then fine let them get fatter but we should always have a choice in something.  From,  STUDENT_NAME 8th grade		0
 The image of a cowboy riding a horse through the rugged wilderness is a classic representation of the American West. However, one cowboy who stood apart from the rest was Duke Kahanamoku, a Hawaiian born cowboy who made his mark in both the rodeo and surfing circles.  Kahanamoku was born in Honolulu in 1890 and raised by his parents who were both American-born. From a young age, he showed a natural talent for both bull riding and surfing. As he grew older, he became known for his exceptional skills in both sports.  In the rodeo, Kahanamoku was known for his impressive performances on horseback, particularly in events such as bull riding and the calf-roping competition. He won numerous awards and accolades throughout his career, including the All-American Cowboy Championships.  However, it was his love of surfing that set Kahanamoku apart from other cowboys. He was one of the first Hawaiians to establish surfing as a popular sport in the United States and is often credited with introducing surfing to Southern California. He became known as the "Father of Modern Surfing" and founded the Duke's Waikiki Beach Hotel, which remains a popular destination for surf enthusiasts today.  Kahanamoku's dual love of rodeo and surfing might seem surprising at first. But once you understand his background, it's not surprising that he was able to excel in both sports. His family roots in both Hawaii and America allowed him to embrace both cultures, and his love of nature and the outdoors led him to both riding and surfing.  Despite his impressive achievements in both sports, Kahanamoku remained humble and down-to-earth. He was known for his kind nature and warm aloha spirit, which endeared him to people from all walks of life.  In conclusion, Duke Kahanamoku was a cowboy who rode the waves in more ways than one. His impressive skills and natural talent for both rodeo and surfing set him apart from other cowboys, and his dual love of these sports reflects his unique upbringing and cultural heritage. Kahanamoku's legacy lives on in the enduring popularity of surfing and his contributions to Hawaiian culture and American history.		1
If you were a teacher trying to teach a class with over 20 people with different emotions, how efficent would it be to know how all of them feeling? You can do that with FACS (Facial Action Coding System), created by Dr. Pail Eckman. This system classifys 6 basic emotions. It can sense happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This is good for teacher who dont understand how their student are feeling about the assignment they assigned.  Dr. Huang, says in paragraph four, "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal." He says, " even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression." Using video imagery, the emotion-recongnition software tracks these facial movements on a real face or even a picture. The author uses an example of the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci. They used the emotion-recongnition on the painting and it showed how Mona Lisa was feeling. It not only looks at how your smiling or how your eye are placed, it also looks at the structure of ur face and how your muscles move.  This creation can help lots of teacher all around the world understand and help students learn more efficently. Every single student learns differently and using this system will help teacher use their teaching time wisely. When student dont understand somthing this system can scan your face and tell the teacher what needs to be fixed to help the student understand and enjoy what they are learning.  Instead of teachers trying to help one student at a time they can help multiple students at once.  You can also use FACS not only in school but other places too. You can use it in work and also in everyday life if you wanted too. In paragrah nine the author talks about a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky. He had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Just making different faces can revel a lot about the science of emotion.  FACS is the next big thing. Science has gone to a whole new level in helping our society. Using this system can help all kinds of people in different ways. I think this can help our world grow and learn new things. 		0
## Limited Car Usage: A Necessity for the Modern World  The car has become a staple of modern life. It is a convenient way to get around, and it allows us to travel long distances quickly and easily. However, there are a number of disadvantages to car usage. Cars contribute to air pollution, they can be expensive to maintain, and they can lead to traffic congestion. In addition, car accidents are a leading cause of death and injury.  For all of these reasons, it is becoming increasingly important to limit car usage. There are a number of ways to do this. One way is to promote public transportation. Public transportation is more efficient than cars, and it does not contribute to air pollution. Another way to limit car usage is to build more bike lanes and sidewalks. This will make it easier for people to walk or bike instead of driving. Finally, we can encourage people to carpool or take ride-sharing services when they need to travel.  Limiting car usage is good for the environment, and it is also good for our health. When we drive less, we breathe less polluted air, and we are less likely to be involved in car accidents. In addition, limiting car usage can save us money on gas and car maintenance.  There are a number of things that we can do to limit car usage. We can choose to live in walkable or bikeable communities, we can use public transportation or carpool when possible, and we can walk or bike for short trips. We can also support policies that promote limited car usage, such as congestion pricing and taxes on gasoline.  Limiting car usage is a wise choice for a number of reasons. It is good for the environment, it is good for our health, and it can save us money. There are a number of things that we can do to limit car usage, and we should all do our part to make it a reality.  Here are some specific examples of how limiting car usage can benefit us:  * **Reduced air pollution:** Cars are a major source of air pollution. When we drive less, we breathe less polluted air. This can improve our health and reduce our risk of respiratory problems. * **Less traffic congestion:** Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities. It wastes time and fuel, and it can be frustrating and stressful. When we drive less, we contribute to less traffic congestion. This makes it easier to get around, and it can improve our quality of life. * **Reduced carbon emissions:** Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. When we drive less, we help to reduce our carbon footprint. This is good for the environment, and it can help to fight climate change. * **Improved health:** Walking and biking are good for our health. They help us to get exercise and reduce our risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. When we limit car usage, we have more opportunities to walk and bike. This can improve our health and well-being. * **Saved money:** Cars are expensive to buy, maintain, and fuel. When we drive less, we can save money on these costs. This can free up money for other things, such as travel, entertainment, or saving for retirement.  In conclusion, there are many reasons why we should limit car usage. It is good for the environment, it is good for our health, and it can save us money. There are a number of things that we can do to limit car usage, and we should all do our part to make it a reality.		1
Hey there! So, like, when people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, right? And, like, you might be wondering why that's a good idea. Well, let me tell you, it's actually super helpful to get multiple opinions!  First of all, when you only talk to one person, you're only getting one perspective. That means you're not seeing the whole picture. It's like, imagine you're trying to put a puzzle together, but you're missing a bunch of pieces. You're not gonna get the full picture, you know? But, if you talk to multiple people, it's like you're getting more pieces of the puzzle. You can see things from different angles, and that can help you make a way better choice.  For example, let's say you're trying to decide which college to go to. If you only talk to one person, they might have a really great experience at one college, but that doesn't mean it's the best fit for you. But, if you talk to multiple people, you can hear about different colleges and what they have to offer. You can get a better sense of what's out there, and make a more informed decision.  Another reason seeking multiple opinions is helpful is that it can help you avoid bias. Like, if you only talk to one person, they might have their own biases and opinions that influence their advice. But, if you talk to multiple people, you're less likely to get biased advice. You're getting a bunch of different perspectives, and that can help you make a more well-rounded decision.  So, like, basically, seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because it gives you a more complete picture, and helps you avoid bias. It's like, the more information you have, the better equipped you are to make a good decision. And, like, who doesn't want to make good decisions, right?		1
As technology has advanced, our methods of transportation have advanced with it. Driverless cars are things of the future, just as regular cars were a thing of the future in the 1900s. There will always be risks and certain safety regulations just as with regular cars but having the technology and not using it would be taking a step back.  The use of driverless cars may seem lazier or seem to have more risks than a manual car but is that not what people once thought about regular cars? Cars already start themselves and can be put in a self driving setting, so a full time driverless car would be a step in the right direction and be all around safer for citizens and drivers everywhere. Having technology run your car rather than a human, the risk and chance of a wreck would decrease dramatically. Although as of now a malfunction in the technology that could cause a crash and whether the manufacturer or the driver is to blame is a blurry topic the restriction of testing the cars would never give them the opportunity to fix the problems. Progress is slow as shown in 2013 when BMW announced the "Traffic Jam Asssistant," which can only function up to 25 mph which wouldn't be nearly enough to drive on actual roads yet but the progress is still there. The lack of states on board with the test driving of these cars is restricting the chances for improvement.  We, as humans, sometimes give up on things we see as impossible but things we think of as normal now seemed impossible 50 years ago. Driverless cars are simply an advancement that we're ready to make and improve but we limit ourselve sin our own abilities. It may be 20 years from now but eventually in the baby steps being taken drvierless cars will see the roads.		0
Some schools require to complete summer projects to make sure students continue to learn over the break.  The pros of when teachers design summer projects they are preping students for the start of the new year and also seeing what students strengths are also, what weakens students. The pros of when students design summer projects are that, they can choose what they want to work on and find something that interests them. That position I am taking in this prompt is, student-designed and here's why.  Yes teachers want to test us on knowledgeable subjects and stories ,but sometimes I believe it is to much on a student not everyone learns the same. Students should be given an equal oppurtunity to do summer projects.  If a student designs the project he or she may actually fin it interesting because, they can do what they want to do instead recieving a designed project from the teacher. Like examples for boys would be different types of sports, all types of cars, marketing, music industry, and many more. For girls it would be cooking, benefits on keeping your hair clean, acting, traveling, and much more. This gives students the oppurtunity to express themselves instead of a teacher thinking that, maybe this is a good topic or that one. Also doing something like this is fair for each student.  As of being a student we also have a lot of activities going on over the summer such as working, sports, traveling to different states, and countries and even more. I think that's another reason why we should design it ourselves. Teachers should also get a break as well because they work all year round so it would make sense for us to do it on our own.  Although teachers can be helpful with coming up with projects and designs. I believe that us as students should be the ones creating and designing our own projects over the summer. It gives us an equal oppurtunity to express are feelings and gives us a voice. That's what I have for you today and I hope I persuaded you enough on why students should design there own summer projects instead of teachers doing it for them.   ¬†		0
The future technologies are improving, and the driverless car becomes popular these days. People dream about driving without the driver; car of course, taxi, bus, train, and air plane. It can bring us convenience. A lot of companies already started working on their driverless vehicles project, it will take huge part of the market in the future.  Driverless car can lead our future technology. It seems useful and practical. However, everything has their pros and cons, so does driverless car. In my opinion, driverless car can't driving without the driver, but it can help drivers drive easily and safely. Here is my articles to support my opinion.  First, it can ruin people's job. A lot people make money from working in the transportation company, if driverless car gets popular, nobody will need a taxi driver or a bus driver anymore. Pilots of trains and planes will no longer needed as well. It is hard to get a job these days even if you graduate the decent college, the driverless car will make this worse.  Second, the sensors and auto systems can help the drivers to drive, but it can't control all process of driving. Sometimes the computer doesn't work properly as our desktops or laptops do, it can cause errors any time. Sometimes driving needs human's ability, especial it's a sudden situation.  Third, the problem of responsibility. For example, if your driverless car hits the person in front of you, it is ambiguous to figure out who has the responsible for the accident. The car company, and the customers will argue to blame each other.  Driverless car can bring convenience to us. It seems very helpful, but it also has obivous problems. People are improving technologies right now at this time as well. But the important thing is people should think more carefully of pros and cons of the future technologies rather than just chasing the benefit in front of them. 		0
The idea of an autonomous car is very interesting but it should not be developed into an actual product. Though there are a few luxuries that come with an autonomous car there are quite a few more liabilities that come with it. The following are just some of the issues that could come up with the driverless car.  The first issue that could come about with these driverless cars is their reliance on absolute perfect conditions. The cars that they have tested needed to be put on a special test course to be used. These roads were nearly perfect roads unlike the roads that we drive on every day. To make this car street legal they would have to make major upgrades to the current roads and that would be way too expensive for the government to do. This is just too expensive to be a feasible idea.  The next issue that may possibly occur is legal disputes. If a car is not being controlled by the human inside of it and it crashes in to another car who is at fault for the wreck? That question will lead into a lot of legal disputes involving the cars if the technology fails. There will be owners who blame the manufacturer for the wreck because they made the technology that failed. They could also blame the driver in the car because they were not paying enough attention to take control of the car and prevent the accident from happening.  The third and final issue is the fact that the cars are not truly driverless. These cars are advertised as self driving cars but in reality they still require a driver. This will problems because if the technology fails and does not alert the driver when they need to to control of the car it could lead to accidents and possibly even deaths. Even if the technology does not fail the slightest of delays when sending a warning that they need to take control of the car could result in an accident or maybe even death. This ties in with the previous point about the legal liabilities that come with the driverless cars.  Overall the autonomous cars are a fascinating idea and one that many people may support but in reality they are a legal liability and they would cost a lot of money and possibly cause accidents or even deaths due to a failure or delay in the cars system that lets the driver know when to take control of the car.   		0
The author of the article states that Venus is a worthy pursuit. They state that though it may be highly dangerous, it still has value. It's worth the risk. They support this by saying that the planet has some features that are analogous to those on Earth, humans are being considered sent to Venus, and people wanting to take samples of things from the planet to test it.  Venus once may have been the most Earth-like planet in the solar system many years ago, which highly fascinated astronomers. The planet was probably made up of mostly oceans and could have had many forms of life, just like our plant Earth today. To this day, Venus still has some features that are analogous to the ones on this planet. Venus has surfaces of rocks and also has features like valleys, mountains, and craters. The planet can sometimes be the nearest one for a visit. Astronomers could take the planetary visit into consideration, considering the long time frames of space travel.  Though it is highly dangerous to send people to Venus, NASA has been considering sending people to study the planet. Venus has an average temperature of over 800 degrees Farhenheit, but NASA could possibly have a solution. Their solution is having scientists float aboce the fray. It would be like a bimp vehicle hovering about 30 miles above the burning temperatures. Though the humans wouldn't be touching the boiling floors, temperatures would still be at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, which everyone would still consider excruciating. The vehicle would almost resemble a jet airplane. Just like a jet travels at a very high altitude to avoid storms, the bimp would avoid the conditions of the boiling grounds of Venus. The author also stated that their would be almost never-ending solar power, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels, which is great. The conditions that humans would have to go through if they do visit Venus are not easy or great, but it would somehow be survivable for them.  If humans are not able to visit the planet, then things from there cannot be tested on. If the only way humans can interact with the planet is by hovering over it, they cannot successfully take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else. Despite the many risks, scientists are trying to find a way to conduct a successful mission to understand the planet and get up close and personal with it. Many researchers are also working on innovations that would allow machines to last through the conditions of Venus. NASA is working on other ways to study the planet as well. They're considering using a very old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first seen in the 1800s and played a very important role during World Was ll in the 1940s. These devices make calcutions by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. The mechanical computers may or may not successfully operate in the extreme conditions. Modern-day computers tend to be more delicate when it comes to those kinds of conditions, despite the fact that they are enormously powerful, easier to manage and operate, quick, and flexible. It would be like dropping a phone, tablet, or computers into a bucket of acid or any heat that would be capable of melting tin.  In conclusion, the author really thinks that humans should be sent to Venus to explore it. He mentions that the planet has some features that are analogous to the ones on Earth, humans being considered to be sent to it, and how scientists would like to take samples of items from the planet. The author also stated that human curiostiy will one day lead to visiting Venus. Though considering the many risks, Earth should be expanded to meet every point of our imagination and innovation.  		0
 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a system developed to identify facial expressions that convey different emotions, sentiments and physiological states. It was first introduced by Paul Ekman in 1970 and since then, it has been widely used in fields like psychology, sociology and anthropology, neuroscience, computer science, and even art and design. In this essay, I will provide an overview of the FACS system, its applications, limitations, and future prospects.  The Facial Action Coding System consists of six groups of muscles that control the movements of facial features. These muscles are arranged in a hierarchical structure, with some muscles being controlled by others. The six groups of muscles are: Frontalis, Proceras, Oculi, Labiobuccis, Circulus, and Rictus. Each muscle group creates a specific facial expression that is used to convey a particular emotion.  The FACS system is based on the idea that facial expressions are universal and can be observed across cultures and age groups. The system has been validated through extensive research, which has shown that it is reliable, consistent, and robust. Studies have shown that FACS can accurately identify different emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, contempt, and disgust.  The FACS system has numerous applications, including clinical psychology, education, marketing, and entertainment. In clinical psychology, FACS is used to diagnose and treat disorders that affect facial expression, such as Tourette  s syndrome and social anxiety disorder. In education, FACS is used to train teachers how to recognize and interpret facial expressions in students, which can help them to better understand and manage student behavior. In marketing, FACS is used to design more effective advertisements by understanding how the target audience will react to different facial expressions. In entertainment, FACS is used to create more realistic and convincing characters by carefully designing their facial expressions.  However, the FACS system is not without its limitations. One of the main limitations is that the system is subjective and may not always be accurate. It is also influenced by cultural and social factors, which may lead to differences in facial expression across different groups. The system is also limited in its ability to capture subtle changes in facial expression, which may be crucial for understanding complex emotions.  Despite these limitations, the FACS system has made a significant contribution to the field of psychology and other related fields. Its ability to accurately identify facial expressions has opened up new possibilities for understanding human behavior and emotions. In the future, further research should be conducted to validate the system  s accuracy and to explore its potential applications in new areas.  In conclusion, Facial Action Coding System is a valuable tool that has numerous applications in various fields. It has been shown to be reliable, valid, and robust, and has contributed to the understanding of human behavior and emotions. Despite its limitations, the FACS system remains an important tool that offers many opportunities for future research and development.		1
 I agree that online or video conferencing distance learning is a great option for students to attend classes from home. There are several reasons why this can be a more beneficial way for students to learn.  Firstly, students can have a more focused and peaceful learning environment when they attend classes online. They can work without being distracted by other students, which can help them to concentrate better on their studies. This can be especially beneficial for students who struggle with distractions in traditional classroom settings.  Secondly, students can save a lot of time by attending classes online. They don't have to worry about waiting for the bus or walking to school, which can be time-consuming and tiring. Instead, they can attend classes from the comfort of their own home, which can help them to feel more relaxed and focused.  Thirdly, students can have access to all the resources and tools they need to succeed when they attend classes online. They can use online resources such as online textbooks, videos, and interactive learning tools to supplement their studies. This can be especially beneficial for students who don't have access to these resources in traditional classroom settings.  Finally, students can have more flexibility and control over their learning when they attend classes online. They can choose when and where to attend classes, which can help them to fit their studies around their other commitments. They can also choose to work at their own pace, which can help them to feel more in control of their learning.  In conclusion, online or video conferencing distance learning is a great option for students who want to learn in a more focused, peaceful, and flexible way. It can offer students many benefits, including more time to study, access to resources and tools, and more control over their learning.		1
Dear Principal Smith,  I am writing to provide my perspective on the school's cell phone policy options under consideration. Of the two choices, I believe Policy 1 is the best approach for our school. Here are three reasons why:  First, completely banning phones under Policy 2 may be unrealistic and difficult to enforce. Teenagers keep their phones with them almost constantly, and asking them to leave valuable devices at home each day is a big adjustment. Some students will inevitably break the rules, leading to discipline issues. Policy 1 is more reasonable and allows for phones to be kept safely in lockers or bags during class time.   Second, phones can have educational uses if used appropriately. During lunch and free periods, students could use phones to look up information, communicate with teachers or study groups, or download educational apps. An outright ban misses these opportunities for phones to supplement learning. Policy 1 supports academic applications of technology outside of direct instructional time.  Third, many students rely on phones to communicate with parents about after-school activities or transportation. Policy 1 understands this need while still minimizing distractions during class. An absolute ban could cause logistical issues for families trying to coordinate after school. Policy 1 strikes a sensible balance that acknowledges phones as a modern necessity.  In conclusion, Policy 1 is the more progressive approach that recognizes students' responsibilities while incorporating technology in a limited, constructive manner. It allows phones on campus in a controlled way without being overly restrictive. I believe most students would respect the clear guidelines of Policy 1. For these reasons, I ask you to choose Policy 1 as our new cell phone policy. Thank you for considering my input.  Sincerely,   [Your name]		1
 The lives of students are often filled with a desire to succeed and achieve their goals. In my opinion, all students who have graduated from school or university should have the opportunity to work in a place where they can demonstrate their skills and gain valuable experience.  However, I believe that students should put in their best effort and remember the lessons they learned during their studies. This will not only help them in their future careers but also make them more independent and confident in their abilities.  Furthermore, I think that students who are not old enough to work, such as those who are 14 or 15 years old, should have the right to have a part-time job. While nobody can deny a student a job for wanting to gain more experience, it is important to ensure that they are old enough to handle the responsibilities that come with working.  In my opinion, every student should have the opportunity to demonstrate their skills and gain experience. This will not only help them in their future careers but also make them more confident and independent. Additionally, it will allow them to choose a career path that aligns with their interests and goals.  In conclusion, students should be given the opportunity to work and demonstrate their skills. By doing so, they will be able to gain valuable experience and confidence in their abilities. Furthermore, it will allow them to choose a career path that aligns with their interests and goals.		1
Title: Community Service Requirement for Elementary School Students  Dear School Board,  As an 8th grader, I believe that community service should be a requirement for all elementary school students. Through my research, I have found that many schools already have community service programs in place, but I think we can do more to encourage students to get involved. In this essay, I will explain the benefits of a community service requirement, create a program for students to participate, and provide criteria for students who are interested in the program.  Benefits of Community Service Requirement:  1. Improved academic performance: Studies have shown that students who participate in community service activities tend to have better grades and higher standardized test scores. 2. Increased empathy and compassion: Community service helps students understand the needs of others and develop empathy for those who are less fortunate. 3. Better communication and teamwork skills: Community service projects require students to work together and communicate effectively to achieve a common goal. 4. Exposure to different cultures and experiences: Community service can provide students with opportunities to learn about different cultures and experiences, broadening their perspectives and understanding of the world.  Program Requirements:  1. Participation: All elementary school students will be required to participate in a community service project once a month. 2. Choice of activities: Students will have the option to choose from a variety of community service activities, such as volunteering at a local animal shelter, cleaning up a nearby park, or visiting a nursing home. 3. Criteria for participation: Students must maintain a good attendance and behavior record, complete any assigned tasks on time, and demonstrate a positive attitude towards community service.  Criteria for Interested Students:  1. Commitment: Students must be committed to participating in the program for the entire school year. 2. Attendance: Students must attend all scheduled community service activities. 3. Participation: Students must actively participate in the community service project and follow instructions.  Inviting Tutors:  1. Experience: Tutors should have experience in the community service field and be able to provide guidance and support to students.		1
I will always remember the joy and excitement of my high school graduation day. After four hard years of academic work and extracurricular activities, finally, I was able to look forward to the bright future that lay ahead of me. On that day, I felt a mix of emotions: happiness, relief, pride, and anticipation.  The morning started with a lot of pageantry. I wore my cap and gown, and marched in procession with my classmates and teachers. During the ceremony, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a strong sense of accomplishment as I glanced at the beaming faces around me. We had all worked so hard and come so far.  After being awarded my diploma, I was overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and affection from my classmates, parents, and teachers. As we hugged and said our goodbyes, I was overwhelmed with emotion and nostalgia. We had all gone through so much together, made lasting memories, and been a support for each other over many years.   I will never forget the warm embraces and exciting cheers from my loved ones. This is why I will cherish that special moment of my high school graduation forever.		1
Hi, my dear friend! I'm so glad you asked me about why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. It's like, when you're trying to pick a movie to watch with your family, you wouldn't just ask one person what they want to watch, right? You'd ask a few people, like your parents, your siblings, and maybe even your friends, to get a better idea of what everyone wants to see.  That's because, when you ask just one person, they might have a different opinion than the others. Like, if you only ask your mom, she might say she wants to watch a romantic comedy, but your dad might want to watch an action movie. If you only ask one of your friends, they might want to watch a horror movie, but another friend might want to watch a funny movie.  So, by asking multiple people, you can get a better idea of what everyone wants. It's like, you're getting a bunch of different perspectives, and you can pick the best one that everyone will enjoy. It's not just about what one person thinks, it's about what everyone thinks.  And, it's not just for movies, it's for everything! Like, if you're trying to decide where to go for dinner, you might ask your family members or friends for their opinions. Someone might suggest a really great Italian restaurant, while another person might suggest a yummy Chinese place. By asking multiple people, you can find a restaurant that everyone will like.  Plus, seeking multiple opinions can also help you avoid making a bad choice. Like, if you only ask one person, they might suggest something that's not very good, or that you might not like. But, if you ask multiple people, they can give you different options and you can pick the best one.  So, my dear friend, always remember that it's a good idea to seek multiple opinions when making a choice. It's like, the more perspectives you have, the better choice you'll make!		1
Dear Mr. Principal,  I have recently over heard that you are changing the school policy so that only students with a grade of B or above my participate in sports and other activities. In some ways I agree with this change. Education is more important than other activities. Yet, sports and other activities are also very influencing in a child's life.  This change is reasonable in many ways. Education is always more important than sports and other extra-curricular activities. School is what helps people have a effective life. It's the foundation of a successful life. Although sports are good for the body, education is what makes people's futures brighter.  Although education is very important, I also think sports and other activities are very prominent too. Sports are what make people healthy. They can make personal issues better. For example, if someone is very self-cautious of their weight, lots of running and workouts can improve those things. Sports can also improve a student's behavior. Not only do they provide exercise, they also teach students how to use team work to get things accomplished. They also teach students a very important life lesson: how to cooperate with on another.  In addition, other activities can get kids involved in their communities and the school. Joining recycling club can teach students how to make the Earth a better place to live. Maybe they'll take the initiative and go pick up trash in their own neighborhoods. Plus, statics say that students participating in sports and other activities are less likely to do drugs.  In conclusion, I think changing the policy is a very big mistake. Although most of the students in our school have a grade average of C, I think they should still be able to participate in sports and other activities. Being active in sports can make for a more healthy person. Also, activities can get students more involved in their communities and the school.  Best regards,  A very concerned student		0
Participating in Adventure: How the Seagoing Cowboys Enriched My Life  Growing up on a ranch in Colorado, my life revolved around caring for cattle and feeling tied to the same landscape. When I heard about the Seagoing Cowboys program, offering to take skilled ranch hands offshore to help with marine research, I was instantly intrigued by the opportunity to experience new places. Reflecting on my time spent with the Seagoing Cowboys, I have found it to be one of the most rewarding experiences of my life that I would happily recommend to others.    During my voyage, I assisted scientists with tagging sharks and collecting water samples in the Gulf of Mexico. Being out at sea on a research vessel felt vastly different than life on my family's ranch, yet I drew upon many of the same skills - like working as part of a team, dealing with unpredictable conditions, and solving problems on the fly. Most remarkably, I visited coastal regions like Florida and Texas that I otherwise may never have seen. Working with marine life was also a completely new experience that allowed me to expand my expertise.   Not only was I challenged in ways that helped me grow both professionally and personally, but I also developed lifelong friendships with the other Seagoing Cowboys and researchers aboard. We bonded over long workdays and achieving successes together as a crew. The program also opened my eyes to possible future career paths combining agriculture and ocean conservation that I am now pursuing further education for.   If given the opportunity, I strongly encourage others to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Beyond getting to experience adventures most only dream of, you will get hands-on career training while making memories that will last a lifetime. Though I miss the wide-open landscapes of home, participating in this program enriched my life in ways I never could have imagined. For anyone seeking an enriched perspective and rewarding personal growth, time spent as a Seagoing Cowboy promises lasting value.		1
Dear State Senator, The Electoral College is unfair for voters all around the United States. The Electoral College is a Winnertakeall system in each state, the candidates don't spend time in the states that they know they have no chance of winning. They only focus on the tight races in the swing states. For example during the campaign in 2000, seventeen states did not see the candidates at all. Voters in the twenteyfive of the largest media markets didn't even get to see a single campaign ad!  Further more, "voters vote for not the president, but a slate of electorss, who in turn elect the president." Voters cant always control who their electorss vote for. The voters sometimes even get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. If you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for Bob Smith just an example, you'd vote for a slate of thirtyfour Democratic electorss who are pledged to Bob Smith. If those electorss won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Bob would get 34 electorsal votes toward his presidency. The electorss can be anyone not holding a public office.  Did you know that over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election more tham the kind of election we have now. According to the article " a gallop poll in 2000, taken shortly after AI Gprethanks to the quirks of the electorsal collegewon the popular vote but lost the presidency. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO, in their time, all agreed on one thing, abolishing the Electoral College. This years voters can and will expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency, once again.  The best argument against the electorsal college is called the disaster factor. Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, but the system allows for worse. " Consider that the state legislature are technically responsible for picking electorss, and that those electorss, and that those electorss could always defy the will of the people." In 1960, segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electorss with brand new electors who would go against John F. Kennedy. Some faithless electorss have even refused to vote for their party's candidate and instead they vote for whoever they want.  So its official now, the Electoral College is outdated, unfair, and irrational. The name makes no sense also why is it called the Electoral "College"? The Electoral College should just be abolished like Bob Dole said.		0
While the mysterious features of the Cydonia region's "Face on Mars" formation have captured people's imaginations and led some to believe it was created by extraterrestrial beings, scientific evidence points to the Face being a completely natural landform. Several key facts support this conclusion.  The article provides compelling evidence that the Face is simply a trick of light and shadow rather than an actual engineered structure. When photos of the Face were enhanced to bring out details, it became apparent that the supposed features were just random bumps and cavities in the martian terrain. No discernible edges or symmetry that would indicate artificial construction could be found. Furthermore, other puzzling landforms in the same region, such as the "D&M Pyramid," dissolved into unremarkable hills and mesas under enhanced imaging. This suggests all the unusual features are natural rock outcroppings that only take on visual resemblance to human artifacts from certain angles and lighting.   Additional support comes from photos of other eroded mesas and plateaus on Mars that have an uncanny resemblance to human profiles or objects. Nature is capable of accidentally sculpting eye-like craters and nose-shaped formations purely through natural weathering and erosion over millions of years. With countless natural formations spread across the planet, it seems inevitable that some random cluster of rocks would happen to vaguely resemble a human face when viewed from the right vantage point, without requiring engineering.   Finally, there is no evidence that Mars could ever have supported life capable of building a structure like the supposed "Face." The environmental conditions have always been far too hostile for complex organisms to evolve, with no oxygen, liquid water or protective magnetic field. Assuming the Face is artificial would require believing Martians constructed it despite this and then somehow vanished without leaving behind any other artifacts or installations. The lack of corroborating evidence makes such a scenario highly improbable compared to the simple geological processes that could sculpt something superficially face-like.  In conclusion, while speculation about the Face on Mars captures people's sense of wonder about life beyond Earth, scientific investigation demonstrates it is virtually certain the formation was crafted solely by natural forces, not aliens. The preponderance of evidence weighs heavily in favor of a mundane geological origin over an engineered structure. Unless compelling new data emerges, we must accept the Face is just a trick of light and shadow playing on our minds.		1
Imagine your alarm clock goes off and you get out of bed, and after doing your morning routine instead of grabbing your book bag¬†to heading out and catching the bus for school instead you open your laptop and open up a video chat with your teacher to get your lesson of the day instead. This idea isn't and is referred to as distance learning. Distance learning already exists in most colleges such as Generic_School and has started to develop in high schools. Many have the impression that this could be the new way to do school work. Others believe that distance learning won't bring much of a change as it says it is and have a rather niche effect in schools. I strongly believe that distance learning can make a big difference in the learning environment.  Every year students end up missing days due to sickness or other matters. These sickly students almost always come back to loads of work to do that they can could not¬†get done while they where out recovering. Distance learning can help with this near inevitable factor. Instead of students worrying about what work they're missing on their sick days they can open up their device and do the work from home. This same practice could also be used in scenarios such as snow days,tornadoes,floods or other bad weather that causes schools to shut down. This could also be the new way to combat schools having to add more school days to make up for the missed ones.  Focusing on other issues, what if you don't even have schools in your area? There are several kids out in the world that live in rural locations are so far from schools that it'd even be too much to send a bus out to bring them to school. This leaves rural students most of the time only two options:move to another house or be home schooled¬†instead by a parent which doesn't give as good as a education as public schools. Home schooling can put a strain on the parent because most of the time it interferes with their jobs. It's unfair knowing that people fall short on education and opportunities compared to everyone else because of the area they live in. The implementation of distance learning can change this problem almost entirely for these students. Places like Australia already participate in this practice with some outback residents attending schools right form their house. No matter where you your house is, you should still be able to get your education  As great as distance learning sounds it, as with all decisions, does not¬†come without drawbacks. Tackling possibly it's biggest problem, distance learning has a high technological dependency to function efficiently and having tech means spending lots of money.  Some schools just dont have the funds to afford technology to give to students which distance learning heavily¬†relies on.  We should be well aware of the financial problem of this idea and maybe in time someone can find a way to make this method more accessible¬†to the masses  Distance learning is a relatively new method on how people get their education. No matter the outside conditions, distance learning can still give students their assignments for the day. This idea in other countries has proven to go beyond and into remote places and provide education to places without schools. Even with the limitations is has now, I'm sure that the use of it will most likely spread in the future. I believe that within some years that distance learning could be a practical way to do school; in fact, it could even be the primary way to attend school.		0
In the article Unmasking the Face on Mars the face is just a natural landform. The reason this is is because there has been things found like this before. Another is that there is no solid proof that the landform was made by aliens. A third reason is that the people that got the rumor started about all of this are conspiracy theorists.  There has been things like this found in space before. In the article the author states that the sensation of finding the landform was short lived because scientists figured it was just another mesa. Since the scientist said another that means there has been things like this found before. If there has been others found before why is this one so special. The scientist state that they were not actually consstructed there.  Besides that there is actually no solid proof that this landform was made by aliens. That is just an opinion. The fact that it looks lika face is the only reason people believed that the landform was made by aliens. Nobody has ever actually been on mars to investigate this landform and prove that it was made by aliens. The only things we have of it are just pictures. So that means that there is no solid proof that the landform was alien made.  The people that came up with the rumor are conspiracy theorists. That means that the thought of this landform being alien made is just a conspiracy theory. A conspiracy theory is just a buch of bits and pieces of infromation that the theorist put together and think is suppost to mean something. These bits and pieces of infromation are put together even if they didn't happen in chronological order. That means that all a conspiracy theory is is an edjucated guess. Once again that also means there if no solid proof about it.  All three of those reasons go along with the fact that the face looking landform in space is not alien made. All of the rumor about this landform beging alien made are just guesses and theories. With that being said I hope that now people will stop believing everything that people say about this subject unless they have solid proof that what they are saying is true.		0

Dear Principal,  Students have many, many friends. But where do they get these friends? Mostly from school. There is no reason to have your phone out during school because whoever you are calling or texting is at school with you. Students should not have the privilege of having their phones at school because they will lose concentration on school work.  The reason cellular phones were made was to converse with your friends and family. The reason school was made was to educate you and help you later on in life. Phones and school do not mix well. The students interacting through the text messages or phone calls will be more concentrated on their conversation. You can communicate with your friends outside of school instead of inside. In Policy 1 the students would be allowed to use their phones at lunch but the person(s) they are conversing with might be in the same lunch as them or in class at the time, so there is no real point in text messaging them over the phone when you can go talk to them during lunch or when you pass by them in the hallway.  A cell phone as (many people know) does numerous things: You can check your E-mail, go on the internet, listen to music, watch videos etc. But there is no need to do that at school it all goes back to the same point, students have time out of school to do it so why don't they do it then? At school they see their friends. There is no need to converse with them on the phone when you can do it face to face.  Phones are a distraction, this is coming from an everyday student. At home I text whilst I do chores and it distracts me and I take up a lot more time to doing these tasks. It goes for the same in schools, if a teacher gives out homework at the end of the class period and the students have five minutes to work on it, how many students do you think would take out their phone and say they finished the work given to them and that it is free time? What if other students were still working on the work and the sounds from the phones were distracting them? A school is NO place for a phone and no matter how many students get angry about no phone privileges it is better for them no matter what they think! The phones are distracting and get the user off task. I say that no phones should be used during school.  Signed,  -Anonymous		0
  Dear [State Senator's Name],  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. While some argue that the system is outdated and unfair, I believe it is still an effective and important part of our democratic process.  One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a candidate must receive broad support across the country, rather than simply relying on a popular vote in a few heavily populated areas. This is particularly important in today's political climate, where polarizing issues and intense partisanship can lead to a divisive and gridlocked political environment. By requiring candidates to win support from a diverse range of states and voters, the Electoral College helps to ensure that the President has a broad base of support and is accountable to a wide range of constituencies.  Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it helps to prevent the "tyranny of the majority." In a pure popular vote system, a candidate could win the presidency by simply concentrating their efforts on heavily populated areas, while ignoring the needs and concerns of voters in other parts of the country. The Electoral College requires candidates to consider the needs and concerns of voters in all states, rather than simply focusing on those in heavily populated areas.  Critics of the Electoral College argue that it is undemocratic and unfair, as it can lead to a candidate winning the presidency without receiving the most popular votes. However, this argument ignores the fact that the Electoral College was designed to ensure that smaller states and rural areas have a voice in the presidential election process. Without the Electoral College, candidates would have little incentive to campaign in these areas, leading to a disproportionate amount of power being concentrated in the		1
I believe that the new technology which is called the Facial Action Coding System is a good idea that will help value students in a classroom . The Facial Action Coding System can help determine the way you feeling , reliezes that you might need help on a lesson that you are not comprehending very well , also it knows when something is bothering you .  When on a computer the Facial Action Coding System determines the way you feeling when the computer constructed 3-D face model revolves around all fourty four major muscles in a human face . When you show emotion towards the computer and have a movement of one or more muscles it is called a action unit which helps the com puter bring all your emotions together and be able to seperte them into they percentages . For example your frontalis pars lateralis muscle ( above your eyes) raises your eyebrows which means your surprised . Your orbicularis oris ( around your mouth) tightens your lips that shows your angry . There many muscles in a human face that has a variety of different ways to show their emotions .  The new technology can also relieze when something is bothering you . For example when your friend ask " whats wrong ? " and you say nothing your friend dictated that you were lying so his/her mouth would stretch sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle , the risorius hich means dont lie . Also it can tell when you are putting on a fake smile and actually hurting inside . The computer is actually showing empathy by feeling someone elses emotional state . Theory of emotion , moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them .  When struggling on a lesson on the computer the Facial Action Coding System will notice . However " a classroom computer could relieze when a student is becoming confused or bored , then it will modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor ." The same technology can make computer - animated faces more expressive - fro video games or video surgery . But also on the other note the new technology couldnt be the best idea due to the fact that some people are going through some stuff and school is a way to clear they mind and going on a computer at school with the new technology would remind them .  Many people dont relieze when their closest friends are going through something and the new technology would him .  I stated that Facial Action Coding System helped you determine your feelings , if something or someone is bothering you or if your struggling on a lesson .

Schools should allow students to design their own summer projects rather than having teachers design them. There are a few key reasons for this.   First, student-designed projects will generate more intrinsic motivation for learning over the summer break. When students have autonomy in choosing what they study, they are more likely to pick a topic that genuinely interests them. As a result, they will be more engaged in the learning process and less likely to see it as a chore. Conversely, projects designed by teachers run the risk of feeling disconnected from the individual student's interests and causing them to disengage or put in only minimal effort.   Secondly, designing their own projects helps students develop important lifelong learning skills. Coming up with a project plan requires critical thinking, research skills, and self-direction - all of which are valuable for both academic and career success. When students are given freedom in their learning, it empowers them to take ownership over what and how they study. This better prepares them for future self-guided learning situations like college or the workplace. Teacher-designed projects do less to foster these independent learning abilities.  Finally, allowing student-designed projects accommodates different learning styles and preferences. Not all students are interested in the same topics or motivated by the same types of activities. When students can choose a project aligned with their interests and strengths, they are better able to approach learning in a way that works for them individually. This helps maximize engagement and performance outcomes. Teacher-designed projects, on the other hand, are less able to accommodate diverse styles and passions among the student body.   In conclusion, schools should implement student-designed summer projects rather than having teachers assign the work. This empowers students, fosters intrinsic motivation, develops important lifelong learning skills, and accommodates differing interests and strengths. Overall, a student-driven approach to summer learning will lead to better outcomes in terms of engagement, motivation and academic development.		1
 Venus is one of the planets that has fascinated scientists and explorers for years. Although the planet is known for its extreme conditions, including scorching temperature, toxic atmosphere and strong gravitational force, there are those who believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author, Mark Thompson, argues that the exploration of Venus is a valuable pursuit that offers the potential to help us learn more about similar harsh environments on other planets in our solar system.  To begin with, Thompson presents a compelling case for why studying Venus is important. He explains that Venus has many features that make it similar to other planets in our solar system, and that studying it will help us to better understand these similarities. For example, while the surface of Venus is too hot and inhospitable for humans to explore, it has many geological features that are similar to those found on Earth, including mountains, volcanoes, and vast deserts. By studying Venus, we can gain a better understanding of these processes and how they occur on other planets without Earth's life-sustaining climate.  Moreover, Thompson suggests that studying Venus will also help us to learn more about the impact of climate change on Earth. He argues that the extreme conditions on Venus, such as its long periods without sunlight and hot surface temperatures, could provide valuable insights into what might happen if we do not take action to slow down climate change. By studying Venus, we can gain a deeper understanding of the potential consequences of not taking care of our planet, and this knowledge could help us to take action to mitigate the impact of climate change.  Furthermore, Thompson highlights the technological advances that have made it possible to explore Venus from Earth. He points out that we now have powerful telescopes and spacecraft that allow us to study Venus in high detail, and that these tools are getting better all the time. He also suggests that with advances in robotics, we may one day be able to send robots to explore Venus' surface. By exploring Venus, we may also be able to test our ability to design and build technology that can withstand harsh conditions, which could be valuable for exploring other planets in our solar system.  In conclusion, Thompson's essay does a good job of supporting the notion that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He presents a compelling case for why Venus is an important object of study, and he suggests that exploring it will help us to learn more about the similarities between planets in our solar system, the impact of climate change on Earth, and the technological skills needed to explore other planets. While there are certainly risks involved in studying Venus, Thompson argues that the potential benefits outweigh them.		1
Do you wanna take care of horses,young cows,and mules? Well if you do,Join the Seagoing Cowboys in taking our adventure ot help people anad places bombed in World War ll.  When Luke and Don were traveling over seas in the Seagoing Cowboys,They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, Headed for Greece. The cargo was 335 horses and enough oats to feed all the horses.  Before arrivingt in Greece,Luke turned 18, Which back then meant that Luke could be drafted for military service.  A couple years later he was discharged,Luke had made nine trips,The most of any Seagoing Cowboy ever. The cattle boat trips were an unbelieveable experience for Luke being a small town boy. Before helping anyone he had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But Luke also got to see the Acropolis in Greece and taking a gondola ride in Venice,Itlay.  Luke also toured at the evacuated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern United States and a month to China.  Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They had to eat and give the animals water three times a day. Bales of hay and oats had to be pulled from the lower ship. The stalls had to be cleaned.		0
The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and can greatly benefit individuals and society as a whole. This concept is becoming increasingly popular around the world, as seen in examples like the German suburb of Vauban, the driving bans in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogota. By reducing car usage, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and create more sustainable and livable communities.  One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some areas of the United States, they account for up to 50 percent. By relying less on cars, we can decrease our carbon footprint and combat climate change.  Furthermore, limiting car usage can greatly improve air quality, as demonstrated by the driving bans in Paris. Smog and pollution from cars can have a detrimental impact on human health, causing respiratory problems and other illnesses. By implementing measures to reduce car usage, we can decrease these health risks and create cleaner and healthier environments.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. With fewer cars on the road, traffic flow can improve, leading to shorter commute times and less frustration for commuters. This is especially evident in car-free communities like Vauban, where residents have embraced alternative forms of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit. By providing better infrastructure and accessibility to these modes of transportation, we can encourage people to leave their cars at home and avoid the gridlock that plagues many cities.  In addition, limiting car usage can lead to the development of more sustainable and livable communities. By adopting the principles of smart planning, as seen in Vauban, we can create neighborhoods that prioritize pedestrians, cyclists, and public transportation rather than cars. Stores placed within walking distance, rather than in distant malls, promote a sense of community and reduce the need for excessive car usage. This approach not only enhances the quality of life for residents but also reduces the dependence on cars, making these communities more environmentally friendly.  Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are clear. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, reducing traffic congestion, and creating sustainable communities, we can mitigate the negative impact of cars and move towards a more environmentally friendly and socially responsible future. It is essential for individuals, communities, and governments to embrace the advantages of limiting car usage and work together to create a more sustainable and livable world.		1
 Car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular in recent years, as more and more people begin to recognize the negative impact that cars have on our environment and quality of life. While some may think that going car-free is an unrealistic goal, it is actually possible, and there are already many cities around the world that have successfully implemented car-free policies. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of car-free cities, as well as some of the strategies that these cities have used to achieve their goals.  One of the biggest advantages of car-free cities is the reduced air pollution that they produce. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and by removing them from our cities, we can drastically reduce the amount of pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. Additionally, car-free cities tend to be quieter and cleaner than their car-dependent counterparts, making them more enjoyable places to live and work.  Car-free cities also benefit from increased physical activity and better health outcomes. When people have to rely on alternative modes of transportation, such as walking or cycling, they are more likely to incorporate exercise into their daily routines. This can lead to improved fitness levels, reduced health risks, and an overall healthier population.  Another advantage of car-free cities is the reduction in traffic congestion and travel time that they provide. Cars are a major source of traffic, and by removing them from the roads, we can reduce congestion and make our cities more efficient and functional. Additionally, cycling and walking are often faster than driving, so people can get to their destinations more quickly without spending time sitting in traffic.  To achieve a car-free city, a number of strategies can be used. One approach is to invest in public transportation, such as buses or trains, to provide people with alternative modes of transportation. Another approach is to encourage cycling and walking by building bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Additionally, some car-free cities have implemented policies such as car-sharing or congestion pricing, which encourage people to use alternative modes of transportation when driving is not necessary.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a number of advantages over their car-dependent counterparts, such as improved air quality, increased physical activity, and reduced congestion. While achieving a fully car-free city may be challenging, there are a number of strategies that cities can use to reduce the number of cars on their roads and create more livable communities. As more and more people recognize the negative impact of cars on our environment and quality of life, it is likely that we will continue to see more car-free cities in the future.		1
In this essay I will be explaining reason from my own point of view and from the story on why I do not think that these kind of vehicles should be created. I will give and back up my reasons on why I disagree with the making of these cars and also state items that were adressed in the passge that I agree with on why these type of cars should not be manufactured.  I disagree that these type of vehicles should be created for many reasons. The main reason is safety. Sure the cars will be able to drive by them selfs at time but that doesn't mean that they will never make mistakes. On a rainy day say you have the car drive by itself for a bit and you just lean back and relax for an hour or two. At any point between the 1 to 2 hours that car could say malfunction and crash hurting you and any other person inside that care. Weither it is just a little fender bender with another car or you total both of the cars and critically injure someone. My secondary reason is explained in the passage we were given to write about. Technology in cars has been growing in cars for the past couple of years varly rapidly. But as the author of the passage states the technology may not always be reliable of efficient in situatuions. The author also states that they car will have the human driver take control if coming to a constructuin site or a school crossing. What if at this time the human driver fell asleep while letting the car drive itself and doesnt tkae conrtol of the car at the correct time and crashes or hurts somebody.  Another reason I disagree withthe making of these kinds of vehicles is also explained in the passage. In paragraph 7 the author states something that I agree with completely. The author states in this paragraph that say someone let their car start to drive by itself and gets into an accident with another car. WHo is to blame for the accident, the human driver or the manufacturer who built the automatci driving system in the car? If you ask me I would have to say both the human driver and the car manufacture's are to blame. The human driver is to blame because if he or she were to be paying attention to what was going on around them they would have been able to react and see the oncoming car and could have possibly been able to avoid collision with the other vehicle.  Tyring to make cars more technology efficient is going to become a big concernin the furtre I think. Now a days we have things like the in-car phone system which myself and the author of the passage find to be very helpful and adds a little bit better percentage to teh safety of drivers when they are not trying to text and talk on their cell phones while driving. Adding this like self driving and automated brakes to cars can cause more safety issuses because they might not always work every time you try to use them.  Thoughout this essay you will find reason form myself and the author that i agree with on why we think that cars should be less automated as possible and the reliablitiy of human drivers should be more promising than technology trying to do it for use.		0
I think that we should be aloud to have phones at school because what if there is somebody that died or is in the hospital now . The school never answerer the phone so they can talk to parents. That is why we should be aloud to have phone in this hell hole. The teachers would not like that but they could get over it and like it. I don't no why they think we don't take are phone to class because we do. The teachers have there's and they ant aloud to have them. There phone go off and they don't get in trouble like we do. I think that is wrong but you no how they pay each other so they wont right each other up. They don't have the right to play on the phone.  The teacher think they should be aloud to have there phone but we ant. I think teachers should not be aloud to have phone if cant. If they pass the law then it wont be as bad.  I think it is wrong for the teachers to take your phone away.  If teachers have there phone we should be aloud to take them away and take them to the principal. If we did that then the teacher would have a problem on picking on us.		0
Why You Should Join the Seagoing Cowboys  There is an exciting program called the Seagoing Cowboys. The Seagoing Cowboys are a group of people who travel the world to help other countries. If you like working and exploring the world join the Seagoing Cowboys! You also get the experience of helping people, also meeting new friends.  My first reason for joining the Seagoing Cowboys is that you get to see the world. In between trips you can always stop to go sightseeing with friends. You can even get a job doing cattle-boat trips where you take trips to other countries that are overseas. While you're sailing overseas you can stop to see a famous landmark as long as it's close by. Such as Luke, it states in the story where he went to go sightseeing in between trips. "So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. Also where it states "Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.  My second reason is that you get the experience of helping people and their country. It tells you in the story, "It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. Being a Seagoing Cowboy can help your personality too, it can make you kinder, and help you show humility. It also says in the story " And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.  My final reason is the experience of making new friends, and having fun with them. You can make new friends in different countries, also people that you work with. Some people that you become friends with can become your best friend for life. It states in the story what fun things you can do with them too, " Luke also found time to have fun on board , especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. " The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped past time.  In conclusion, there are many reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys. You can join for the experience of helping people, the experience of seeing the world, or you can join to make new friends and having fun with them. Being a Seagoing Cowboy can also help strengthen you're personality, and help you be aware of people and their needs and wants.         		0
The modern automobile has been the axle to the wheel of the smog ridden contemporary age. Within a century, a car could be found within virtually every home across every developed nation. Though in recent years, the societal infatuation with private automobiles has begun to diminish. multiple European and South American countries began instituting beneficial "carfree" municipal policies and statistics show a decline in license registration and car purchases across the U.S. The progression of the "carfree" policies and trend will have beneficial ecological, economical, and social implications on the modern world.  The concern of greenhouse gas emissions from cars has been of much concern within the scientific world. With cities such as densely populated Bejing often covered in sheets of poisonous smog, the high emissions has proven deadly to both human and environmental life. According to source 2, Paris recently was plagued by statuated amounts of smog rivaling that of Bejing. The French solution to this problem was municipal action and a week long ban on certain vehicles. The smog contained nearly 147 micrograms of particulate matter and the country's high use of diesel as a gasoline alternative was a contributing factor. The policy was immediately effective as the smog lifted after only one day of the ban. Though the smog that plagued Paris is not only a problem of the French. As stated by Source 1, passenger cars alone are responsible for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions within carintensive areas of the U.S. such as Chicago and detroit.  The focus on automobiles with the development of carintensive cities, such as the aforementioned Chicago and detroit, has carried an economical burden in tandem with it's ecological consequences. According to Source 1, 80 percent of monetary appropriations have gone to highways with 20 percent going to other forms of public transit. As exemplified within the same article, Vauban, Germany has pioneered the carfree suburban model. Maximizing ergonomic to improve public foot transit, it has financially benefited from the prohibition of cars and the nuturing of its environment. Within the South American capital of Bogota, Columbia, who have been promoting an improvement campaign designed to encourage pedestraincentric municipal development. As an effect of in newly revitalized walkways and parks, an industry of shops and restaurants appeared.  Within the United States the "carfree" movement has been gaining support. As stated by Source 4, President Obama demonstrated his vision to curb greenhouse gas emissions in a speech in 2013. This statement was aided by polls showing a demopraghic shift in licensed citizens.		0
The face on mars have to be a alien because back in time they did not have spaceships. If they did have spaceships back in the past we would of already discover it by now. It's probably a alien because it was buried in the ground for so may years that face is actually popping out. They should unburied it to see if it's human or not. If it is they have alot of research to do if not they still have alot have research to do. They should try to see if a body goes with that head. It could be a decovery of a new world. At the end of the article they said " that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." They can also look up any information about mars having a volcanoe. That no one knows about. but if we just know found this it is more likey to be a alien. Because we been going to mars for a long time and it's weird that they just know recover that face. What happen if it's not a alien or human what if its just a rock that turned into a face.         		0
[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP] [Date]  [Senator's Name] [Senator's Address] [City, State, ZIP]  Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],  I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College as a method to elect the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a necessary compromise that ensures a fair and balanced representation of the American people.  Firstly, the Electoral College offers a certainty of outcome. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the winner must have broad support across different regions, rather than just winning the popular vote in a few densely populated areas. It prevents candidates from solely focusing on populous states and encourages them to campaign throughout the country, understanding the concerns and needs of various regions.  Secondly, the Electoral College guarantees that every region and state has a voice in the election process. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which forces candidates to have trans-regional appeal. By requiring candidates to garner support from all parts of the country, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the interests of all Americans, rather than a few concentrated populations.  Thirdly, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in each state incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states. These states, where the race is close and the outcome uncertain, receive the most attention from candidates. This encourages voters in these states to pay closer attention to the campaign, listen to the competing candidates, and make more informed decisions. The Electoral College promotes engagement and thoughtful voting among citizens.  Fourthly, the Electoral College restores balance in the political power of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, already favors smaller states. The Electoral College balances this by ensuring that larger states receive more attention from candidates. It prevents candidates from solely catering to the interests of densely populated areas and encourages consideration of the concerns and needs of less populous regions as well.  Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This is particularly important in a diverse and pluralistic society like ours, where establishing a clear winner without the need for additional rounds of voting preserves stability and reduces the complications of the election process.  While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage voters in states where their preferred candidate is unlikely to win, it is important to note that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. Voters are motivated to express their political preference, not solely to decide an election with a single vote. The Electoral College does not diminish the importance of individual voters but rather ensures that the collective voice of the American people is accurately represented.  In conclusion, the Electoral College strikes a balance between a direct popular vote and election by Congress. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, represents the interests of all Americans, encourages engagement and thoughtful voting, balances the power of different states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. It is a fair and effective method to elect the President of the United States.  Thank you for taking the time to consider my view. I trust that you will take this into account when deciding on the future of our electoral system.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Everyone has asked for advice or asked for someones opinion on things. Asking for advice is something we all do. We want the approval and acceptance of others to try to fit in. I have asked many people their opinions on my hair, clothes, shoes, etc. Knowing that I'm accepted by my peers makes me feel like I fit in more. School is like a game; if you don't wear the same clothes, talk the same or act the same then your out and you lost the game you didn't even know you were playing. Seeking multiple opinions can help you because you get a different perspective on things, you start to learn how to make the best decicions for you, and you'll become accepted and less judged.  One reason why people ask for others opinion on things is so that they get a different perspective. Looking at something one minded and not being open to other ides can block creativity. Causing you to not be so confident in your desicions. Which personally makes me paranoid. Yes, we all make mistakes and learn from them, but we won't learn anyhting if all people do when we make a mistake is judge you and hold a grudge. So getting somebody else's perspective on what you wear, say, and do can stop you from making a mistake that most people won't forgive you for.  Another reason why people ask for others opinion on things is so that you learn how to make the best desicions for you. After a while, you'll start to want to explore with your life and do things you want to do. Asking people for help when you most need it can help you prepare and be ready for situations that will come. Then after you can decide for yourself knowing that you won't be judged for it. Going outside your comfort zone can make you more confident and more proud of your choices. Having someone else decide for you sometimes can help you learn what choices are best for you.  Lastly, another reason why people ask for others opinion is so that they will be approved and accepted by others. I'd rather ask for others opinions then choose for myself and then be outcasted and embarrased. Being rejected and not loved is one of my worst fears, so I'm not gonna let it happen by making the wrong choice. Being outcasted by the entire school just because you wore the wrong thing or you said something that somebody didn't approve of is heartbreaking. Everyone wants to be loved and accepted by others, so why don't we just ask for their way of seeing things. Most of my classmates feel the same way. I think we all just want to fit in and be normal.  In conclusion, asking for peoples opinions can benifit you in many ways. It could even be an asset later on in life. I know that it's good to be different and unique, but in school and life it's not. If someone is unique in life then they will be squashed like a bug by everyone else and seen as nothing. I feel like that sometimes and so do my peers. Being judged and feeling like nothing can bring down you self asteem. Who knows though, maybe later on in life it will change. We'll just have to wait and see.   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
The article ‚ÄúThe Challenge of Exploring Venus ?by David Grinspoon argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Grinspoon provides several reasons why studying Venus is important, including its proximity to Earth, its potential to be habitable, and its unique geology. However, he also acknowledges the many challenges that would be faced by any mission to Venus, including the planet‚Äôs extreme heat, pressure, and atmosphere. Ultimately, Grinspoon concludes that the potential benefits of studying Venus outweigh the risks, and that a mission to Venus is worth the effort.  In my opinion, Grinspoon does a good job of supporting his argument that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. He provides a compelling case for why Venus is an important planet to study, and he also acknowledges the challenges that would be faced by any mission to Venus. However, I think Grinspoon could have done a better job of providing specific details about the potential benefits of studying Venus. For example, he mentions that Venus may have once been habitable, but he doesn‚Äôt provide any evidence to support this claim. He also says that Venus‚Äôs atmosphere is unique, but he doesn‚Äôt explain why this is important.  Overall, I think Grinspoon makes a convincing case that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. However, I think he could have done a better job of supporting his argument with specific details.  **Claim:** The author does a good job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, but could have done a better job of providing specific details about the potential benefits of studying Venus.  **Evidence:**  * Venus is the closest planet to Earth, making it a relatively easy target for exploration. * Venus may have once been habitable, and studying the planet could help us learn more about the history of our solar system. * Venus‚Äôs atmosphere is unique, and studying it could help us better understand the atmospheres of other planets. * The challenges of exploring Venus would be great, but the potential rewards would be even greater.  **Conclusion:**  Despite the challenges, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. The planet is a treasure trove of information about our solar system, and the potential benefits of studying it are enormous.		1
Homework is a subject of debate among students, teachers, parents, and educational institutions. Some people believe that it is an essential part of learning, while others argue that it places unnecessary stress on the students. In my opinion, homework is crucial in helping students learn and grow.  To begin with, homework reinforces what is taught in class. Teachers can‚Äôt cover all topics in a single class period, so they give students assignments to complete outside of school. This allows students to practice what they‚Äôve learned, and it helps them to remember the information better. If students don‚Äôt do their homework, it can lead to gaps in their knowledge and poor performance on exams.  Moreover, homework teaches responsibility and time management. It requires students to plan their time wisely and to prioritize their tasks. By completing assignments on time, students develop a sense of discipline that will serve them well throughout their lives. Homework also teaches students to work independently, which is an important skill in any profession.  However, I understand the argument against homework. It can be stressful, especially if students have multiple assignments due at the same time. It can also take up valuable time that could be used for relaxation, extracurricular activities or spending time with family and friends. However, these issues can be addressed by setting reasonable expectations for homework and by providing students with resources and support to help them manage their workload.  In conclusion, homework plays an important role in the learning process. It reinforces classroom learning, teaches responsibility and time management, and helps students to develop important skills. While there can be downsides to homework, these can be addressed with reasonable expectations and support. Therefore, schools should continue to assign homework, but in a way that is manageable and beneficial for all.		1
Dear Principal,  I have all of my averages in the 90s and above.  The new policy doesn't affect me but I must say that I strongly disagree.  Many students cannot keep up with their grades, and look towards sports as an answer.  Some people have a natural talent for sports, but their grades aren't as high as a B.  I have played soccer my entire life and other kids my age have been the same with other sports.  In my household, my parents do not tolerate anything lower than a 90% .  I do not know about anyone else, but some people, allow their grades to be in the 80 range.  I find it unfair for a new policy to be at hand because there are kids in this world that are mentally challenged.  What if they were not able to keep up in their class work but they loved to play baseball.  Would that be fair to them?  Would it be fair to not let them play the sport that they love just because they are in the C range?  I understand if they were failing all of their classes, but I feel that raising the standards to a B is kind of harsh.  I am a soccer player who plays for the NJ Stallions.  My team went to the 2010 North American Super-Y Nationals, in Tampa, Florida.  It took a lot of effort and time to get there.  We practice every single day of the week.  Most of the kids on my soccer team have a B average, while the others had a C average.  If that was the school soccer team, the players with the C average, wouldn't be able to go.  What if they were the top goal scorers on the team?  Would you want to be responsible for making the team lose?  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME  8th Grade		0
Working in a group versus working alone: an analysis of the benefits and drawbacks  As an eighth-grade student, I have had the opportunity to work in both individual and group settings. While I have my own preferences when it comes to working, I believe that there are benefits to both approaches. In this essay, I will investigate the advantages and disadvantages of working in a group versus working alone, and analyze my own personal preferences.  Working in a group can be highly beneficial, as it allows for the division of labor and the sharing of ideas. When working in a group, each member can focus on a specific task, allowing for more efficient use of time and resources. Additionally, working in a group can lead to the exchange of new ideas and perspectives, which can lead to more creative solutions to problems.  However, there are also disadvantages to working in a group. For example, group work can be difficult to manage, and it can be challenging to coordinate schedules and delegate tasks effectively. Additionally, group work can be prone to conflicts and disagreements, which can be time-consuming and disruptive.  When it comes to working alone, there are also advantages and disadvantages to consider. Working alone can be highly efficient, as there are no distractions or interruptions from others. Additionally, working alone can allow for a more focused and personalized approach to a task, as the individual can tailor their work to their own preferences and strengths.  However, working alone can also be isolating, and it can be difficult to get feedback and support from others. Additionally, working alone can be prone to burnout and fatigue, as there is no one to share the workload with.  In terms of my own personal preferences, I find that I work best when I have a balance of individual and group work. I enjoy the benefits of working in a group, such as the exchange of ideas and the division of labor, but I also appreciate the efficiency and focus that comes with working alone. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on the specific task and the individual's strengths and preferences.  In conclusion, working in a group versus working alone has its own advantages and disadvantages. While working in a group can lead to more efficient use of time and resources, it can also be prone to conflicts and disagreements. Working alone can		1
The Dangers of Using Cell phones While Driving  While some see that there is no problem with texting and driving, there is a law that says otherwise. Texting and driving are not safe for any age citizens. Texting is a distraction from focusing on the road while driving. There is no multitasking when it comes to texting and driving. There have been too many car accidents that have been caused by people using their phones while driving. To reduce the number of deaths due to texting and driving cell phones should not be permitted by drivers in any capacity.  Georgia's Hands-Free Law came into effect on July 1, 2018. ( "Georgia Department Of Driver Services, " 2018). This law states describes that it is illegal for drivers to hold their cell phones while driving. Drivers are allowed to use GPS, voice to text features, and receive and make calls hands free. Earphones are the best to use in this case; however, a person can only use one earpiece at a time. This law will help to reduce the number of many accidents caused by distracted drivers from cell phones.  In general, citizens should not use a cell phone while driving. Being on the phone while driving increases the risk of crashing. Even if you are stopped at a red traffic light, it is illegal and not safe. If there is an accident for texting and driving, there are penalties. The penalties are based on the first, second, and third offense. At each offense, there is a monetary fee and points taken off of your driver's license. If a driver has too many offenses, this could result in the suspension of an individual's license.  Unfortunately, there is one thing that people cannot multitask in, and that is texting and driving. When drivers text their attention is divided when it should be focused only on the road. Texting and driving is a dangerous thing because you can injure or kill someone else or even yourself. When driving you not only have to be focused on the road but also you have to be considerate of others on the road.  After all, texting and driving is against the law and just is not safe. No matter how young or old you are, you cannot focus on driving and texting without being at risk of having an accident. To protect your own life and others do not use your phone while driving. If you want to use your phone, you should wait until parked off the road. That way, you will not get any tickets, nor will anyone's life will be at risk.

The Electoral College has made everything easier on people. They keep votes fair, clear and concise and make them uncomplicated. Although there are some against the idea, the benefits outweigh the detriments immensely.  Bradford Plumer author of " " insists that "the electoral college is unfair to voters"source 2 paragraph 13. This is surely an opinion as he is just trying to deride the Electoral College. However majority of states vote in favor of the Electoral College anyway. It gives a simple vote to people and produces a clear winner. Also he states that "the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."p.12 He thinks that one representative cant speak for his region, but thats why they vote right? He represents the majority supplementing a clear representation of his stateregion.  Also columnist Richard Posner implies that the Electoral College has "a presidential candidate that has transregional appeal" Source 3 paragraph 19. So the presidential candidate can be based off a full region or more, not just a few states. This makes the vote obvious and is a more fair vote. Also the Office of Federal Register tells us there are 538 electors with a 270 majority int the Electoral CollegeSource 1 paragraph 3. Not only is there great variety present but with many votes they make the result concise.  Not only is the Electoral College making votes concise and fair, also it is currently working. Bradford Plumer states "The electoral college is...outdated"Source 2 paragraph 14. How can it be so obsolete if it is presently working out. The Electoral College is giving the vote meaning and depth in that it gives voters the choice of president and his electors. The Office of the Fedral Register informs us "You help choose you state's electors when you vote for your president"Source 1 paragraph 6. This gives the voters more voting power as the get to help choose other things in goverment.  Even though there are many counterclaims, the benefits surely outweigh the detriments. Its nearly a perfect system. The fair, multifarious choices, and clear voting of the Electoral college proves it deserves it's stay in the goverment.		0
 The Face on Mars is a fascinating subject that has captivated many astrobiologists and scientists, with numerous theories about its creation and meaning. The Face on Mars is a geological feature that is found in the Cydonia region, on the right side of the planet  s equator. A wide range of features including mesas, rilles, and towers are located in this area, making it a focal point for further exploration.  One theory about the Face on Mars is that it is a remnant of an ancient Martian civilization that once lived on the planet. According to this theory, the Face was created by extraterrestrial beings that lived on Mars eons ago. The Face could have been a monument or a representation of a deity created by the Martian people. Another theory is that the Face on Mars is a natural formation caused by volcanic eruptions and weathering processes. The formation could have been the result of a volcanic collapse or lava flows that formed over time, leaving behind the distinct features.  There are some scientists who believe that the Face on Mars is caused by radiation and other cosmic events that impacted the planet  s surface. This theory is based on the idea that Mars was once much warmer and wetter than it is today, and that these geological processes could have caused the features on the Face. Another possibility is that the Face on Mars is the result of a meteor impact that devastated the Martian surface, causing the formation of the various geological features.  Despite the many theories, the true meaning and purpose of the Face on Mars remains unknown. The face is a complex geological formation that has captured the imagination of scientists, researchers, and curious people around the world. As space exploration continues and technology advances, we may one day unlock the secrets of this enigmatic face and learn more about the past and potential future of Mars.		1
 The face on Mars has been a subject of fascination for people all around the world for many years. Scientists have been studying the planet and trying to decipher what the mysterious face might mean. Some have even suggested that the face was created by alien life forms. In this essay, I will explore the various theories about the face on Mars and why they are plausible or not.  One theory about the face on Mars is that it is a geological formation. Scientists have proposed that the face is a giant volcanic crater that has been eroded over time by wind and weather. This idea is supported by the fact that the face is located in a region of Mars known for its volcanic activity. Additionally, some features on the face mimic the effects of volcanic activity, such as the appearance of lava fields and the presence of channels carved by lava flows.  Another theory about the face on Mars is that it is a natural phenomenon created by the planet's weather. Scientists have suggested that the face could be the result of wind erosion or sandstorms that have shaped the landscape over time. This idea is supported by the fact that Mars is known for its dust storms, which can be incredibly powerful and are caused by the planet's strong wind. Additionally, some features on the face appear to have been shaped by wind erosion, such as the appearance of long, meandering channels that have been carved by the wind.  A more speculative theory about the face on Mars is that it is a sign of intelligent life on the planet. Some people have suggested that the face could have been created by an advanced alien civilization that once called Mars home. This idea is not supported by any scientific evidence, and many scientists argue that there is no evidence to suggest that intelligent life ever existed on Mars. Additionally, the face is in a region of Mars that is known to be rich in geological resources, which could have sustained life if it ever existed.  In conclusion, the face on Mars is a fascinating subject that has captured the imagination of people around the world. While there are many theories about what the face might mean, the most plausible theories are those suggesting that it is a geological formation or a natural phenomenon created by Mars' wind. However, these theories are still debated among scientists, and the true nature of the face on Mars may never be definitively known.		1
Dear, Senator Electoral college has been around for centuries and as time changes, things start to evolve and grow along with the time period.  Some things are meant to be changed according to the lifestyle of our people now. Hundreds of years back, the electoral college might have worked for the citizens living during that time. However, this is a new century and many people agree with the fact that the electoral college is out dated and we need to change to the election by popular vote. Firstly, because the people are putting their vote into the hands of a person whom they might not even consider the votes of their state's people. Also, the electoral college causes many issues during the voting period.  To start off, The electoral college is a huge risk that the state's people must take each year.  You never know whether or not your electors will suddenly change their mind and vote for a candidate that you personally didn't want. In the article "The indefensible electoral college: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong" Bradford Plumer states "Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes." Plumer Paragraph 10 What the author is explaining is that during the presidential election, once you vote on your selection for the next president and you give your vote to the state electors you never know if they might change their mind or get scared and choose the incorrect candidate. For example, you choose on Barack Obama for president and you give your vote to the state electors and when it's time to vote... they decide to switch and choose HILARY CLINTON!  Many of the citizens who voted for Barack Obama are now outraged by the thought of their state electors doing such a thing.  If we had elections by popular vote we would be able to choose whom we specifically want for our President and there wouldn't be so much tension between people.  Furthermore, the article "The indefensible electoral college: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system ae wrong" Bradford explains "Back in 1960, Segregationists in the louisiana legislaure nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors whoo would oppose John F. Kennedy." This quote from the article is saying that the electors could easily manipulate you and change their votes in order to get what they want, forgetting about all the other votes of the people back home waiting for the news that their selection has won the presidency.  The elecoral college completely demolishes the purpose of the people's vote.  Additionally, electoral colleges should be abolished because not everyone feels as strongly about it as they did hundreds of years ago when the process first came about. What had started out as a good idea has slowly turned into a unpredictable disaster. From time to time, People would be let down when they find out that the candidate they had chosen didn't win the election, Why? because their state electors decided that it was okay for them to simply go against everyone else and be selfish by choosing their own candidate for presidency.  Bradford proves this by explaining "...'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..." Plumer Paragraph 11 On multiple occasions voters have done exactly that, choosing someone completely different than whom they were supposed to. Many members of the party get angry with such childish behavior because it's selfish, uncalled for, and just disrespectful to go about ignoring the one major duty they had to cast a vote for their selected candidate. The article "In defense of the electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president" Richard A. Posner exclaims "The electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner." Posner Paragraph 15 What the author is explaining is that the electoral college is an old custom and it's time that it was changed to something new like the election by popular vote.  Time has changed, an so has the political veiws. The election by popular vote is a better opportunity because the state's people get to vote on exactly who they want without any major risks to deal with later on. Also, the election by popular vote is a simple and easier way of electing president.  On the other hand, there are very few reasons that are pointing towards the electoral college being a good idea. For example, The electoral college has a even number of votes which make it easier to have a more predictable outcome of who might win the election. Although, not everyone might get the candidate that they had hoped for originally. The electoral college also comes along with the "Winnertakeall" method in which the awarding electoral votes induces the candidates running for the presidency.  However, this is only based on the candidate that has the most popular votes.  There are various reasons to consider the electoral college but many of them are followed by an overload of reasons to keep the electoral college in use.  Lastly, the election by popular vote should be used instead of the electoral college. The electoral college comes along with many complications and difficulties unlike the election by popular vote it has a simple and easier way of choosing who you want in the next presidency. Many people feel that you should change over to the election by popular vote to benefit all of the state's people so that they can have a more acurrate estimation of who they might have as their new president.  According to Bradford, the electoral college is "...Unfair, outdated, and irrational." Plumer paragraph 14 It's about time we got rid of it and changed the way we elected our new president.		0
 Facial Action Coding System: Understanding the Science Behind Human Expressions  As a society, we rely heavily on nonverbal communication to convey emotions, feelings, and intentions. One of the most common methods for recognizing and interpreting these subtle signs is through the use of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), developed by Ekman and Wallace in 1992. In this essay, we  ll explore the basic principles of FACS, the importance of understanding facial expression, and some real-world applications of this fascinating tool.  FACS is a system for identifying and categorizing patterns of muscle movements across the face. By analyzing these micro-expressions, it is possible to determine the emotional state of an individual, even if they are actively trying to conceal their feelings. Facial expressions can be broken down into six basic categories: happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, and surprise. By examining the specific muscles involved in each expression, researchers have been able to develop a coding system that accurately captures the range of human emotions.  The importance of understanding facial expressions cannot be overstated. As a primary mode of communication, facial expressions are essential for conveying emotional intentions, helping individuals to understand each other  s feelings and react appropriately. FACS has a wide range of applications in fields such as psychology, psychiatry, marketing, and even forensics. For example, FACS is often used in therapy to help individuals better understand and manage their emotions, and in law enforcement to analyze suspects   expressions and determine their potential guilt or innocence.  However, it is important to recognize that FACS is not a magic tool for accurately predicting people  s thoughts and feelings. While facial expressions can provide valuable insights, they should be interpreted in conjunction with other forms of communication, such as verbal cues and body language. Moreover, individuals may consciously suppress their true emotions, making it difficult for FACS to accurately detect their feelings.  In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is a powerful tool for understanding the complex world of human emotions. By breaking down facial expressions into distinct categories, FACS enables us to better understand the range of emotions that drive our behavior. Whether used in therapy, law enforcement, or marketing, FACS has the potential to transform the way we communicate and interact with each other. However, it is important to remember that facial expressions are just one part of the communication equation, and that a nuanced understanding of human emotions requires a multidisciplinary approach.		1
If everyone does one extracurricular activity then we wouldn't have after school activities like art club, homework club, and cooking club. People might think that they should chose witch extracurricular activity they could do and ,not one given to them by force. But some also might say that its great practice for the real world and, we should get used to it. Not only that we should also be prepared for extra work in some jobs but we also need to be more active. Why do we have to do one not by choice but rather by someone else.  Why do we go to after school classes because you might be struggling in classes or its a after school club. For the after school clubs we might need help with English or, help with math but the extra activities might make you struggle more from less time to do homework or study for tests. For instance when you have a sol you need to study and prepare for that but if you have a extracurricular activity you will have to do that first and then study it doesn't seem like a good way to prep students for a huge test. Not only that if they choose to add more time for these activities then it would be easy for after school clubs but students will hate it.  Adding more time to school will make most people unhappy and maybe even stressed out from too much work. Whenever more time is added to school it means more classes and usually its more than just one class being added its most likely two or three maybe more. When people find out there is more time in school they will try to change it to less time in school because people hate change. Not only that people hate more time they will not get more time for lunch and lunch is important if you dont have food then you will starve or you will be super sluggish. But also you have no choice for the activity you have been given to you.  You might be struggling in public speaking but you were given work with people in drama and try to go over the script for the next play. This is why there needs to be choice in the matter of activities you are apart in. Someone also might want a specific job but might have a skill that has no indicators that it can work with that job you want. So it's a draw from the hat situation basically and if your unlucky enough you will get something other than you wanted.  Everything comes down to what do you like not what the person that makes the rules thats their opinion¬†and you dont have to like it. Adding more time just makes the days longer and tougher but one day everyone will get used¬†to it. Not only do people have not being able to change things they don't like not making a difference they want to see their dreams come true but life isn't like that. Why dont we have a choice and we dislike these changes so why are they made?¬†		0
Can you see the emotions in the Mona Lisa? A latest technology that can recognize emotions was the latest innovation from Prof. This technology claims it has the ability to read every emotion, even in pictures. Is this a reliable technology or is this something that isnt exact?  The recent technology on seeing emotions talks about how the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. How can we know if this is true because we were not there to tell what her emotions where. Yes you can see some emotion in her painting, because it states that Da Vinci studied the human anatomy so that it would help him with painting facial muslces precisely to show emotion.  This technology can be good for some purposes. Dr. Huang makes a statement saying, "A classroom computer could tell when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human structor." This is a good factor, because this can help students with school so theyre not falling behind.  Overall this technology may have some pros, and it has some cons. If you put it to good use like for instince helping kids when theyre confused or bored it will show them other ways which is good. Then you have your cons. This technology might not always be precise and at some point this could lead to problems when trying to solve a serious situation. This technology is realiable at some points, theyre are multiple ways it can help and then there can be some disfunctions. Every technology has their flaws though.		0
The reason that Luke join the program was of is friend i know this because it said that Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP] [Date]  [Senator‚Äôs Name] [Address] [City, State, ZIP]  Dear Senator [Senator‚Äôs Last Name],  I am writing to express my views on the Electoral College and to argue in favor of maintaining this unique system for electing the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe the Electoral College is crucial in ensuring a fair and balanced representation of the American people.  One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely to occur compared to when the popular vote is the determining factor. With almost all states awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, a slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory, providing a clear and decisive result.  Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in the election. As Posner states, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This means that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be successful, as they need to gain support from various regions and take into account the interests of all Americans. This helps prevent candidates from focusing solely on populous areas or ignoring states with lower population densities. It ensures that the president represents the nation as a whole, avoiding a scenario where only certain states or regions receive attention and influence.  Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, where the election outcome is less predictable. This forces candidates to address the specific concerns and needs of swing state voters, who are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and be informed about the competing candidates. By engaging with swing state voters, candidates have to appeal to a broader range of voters and address a wider range of issues, ultimately leading to better-informed decisions and policies.  Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it gives sufficient weight to large states, ensuring that they have a significant influence in the political process. Posner highlights that the popular vote in a large state like Florida can have a substantial impact through the allocation of electoral votes. This balances the power between large and small states, ensuring that candidates do not solely focus on the biggest states and neglect the concerns of smaller states. This balanced approach allows for a more comprehensive representation of the diverse needs and interests of the American people.  Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the problem of having run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. In such a scenario, there would be pressure for further elections, which would complicate the presidential election process. By having the Electoral College, we ensure that a clear winner is determined in a timely manner, preventing any uncertainty or ambiguity in the election results.  While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in non-competitive states from participating, the fact remains that nearly half of the eligible American population still voted in the 2012 election, suggesting that voters are motivated by a desire to express their political preferences rather than the belief that a single vote will decide the outcome.  In conclusion, the Electoral College is a process that has stood the test of time and has proven effective in providing a fair representation of the American people. It allows for certainty of outcome, ensures that every region's voice is heard, encourages candidates to engage with swing state voters, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the complexities of run-off elections.  I would urge you to consider these points when discussing any potential changes to our electoral system. The Electoral College, while not perfect, is a valuable institution that upholds the principles of democracy and ensures a fair representation for all Americans.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Teacher designed projects and student designed projects differ in many ways. This is mainly because students prefer to create projects based solely upon something they already enjoy and know. Teacher based projects prove to be superior by being both more efficient and a better learning tool than their counterpart and in turn student projects prove to be inferior mainly because students prefer to complete projects based on something they already know, then learning something new. Teacher based projects can be proved more superior by using current event, historical, and personal examples.  In today's world students are proving to be more disobedient and disrespectful. This is mainly related to teachers trying to make students more independent and self relying, which is important, but can also be a challenge in the workplace and towards authoritative figures. Teachers are placing more student designed projects in their curriculum and in turn is showing students that everything in life will be suited specifically to their wants and needs, which is false. Teacher designed projects teach students to be independent and self relying, but they also teach them to research and learn and that some things aren't always specifically based on their preferences. A current event example that directly correlates to this problem is the phrase "boomer." This word is directed towards the Baby Boomer Generation and is used to describe the independent and self relying seniors who dont agree with the way the schooling system is operated. This generation lived in a time where authority was the key figure across the nation and it was not to be disrespected or major consequences would occur.  Further along, the years, decades, and centuries, times change and society grows either for the better or worse. A major system that has changed along the years is the schooling system and a major factor in this change is teachers allowing more student based projects, instead of teacher based projects. This is a major turn for the worse because students are taking advantage of this and aren't learning anything new for themselves, which is creating more volatile and unintelligent individuals. A historical example that relates more to the way the schooling was before this was the Brown v. Board of Education case. Although, this was a terrible time of segregated schools it was the Brown family who took independence when no one would stand with them and they took the fight to the Supreme Court for their well deserved equality and civil right. However, it would be another grueling, sad 20 years until this¬†was accomplished it can be believed that the way the curriculum was taught related to the way¬†this family was courageous enough to complete this task.  In my personal experience I have yearned for the chance to create a student based project. However, I have learned that teacher based projects are more informational and they give students the chance to learn something new. A direct example of this would be when I was issued a student designed project my tenth grade summer and at first I found it interesting until I received a hundred percent on it. This made me realize that I wasn't learning anything by doing this student based project and that it was more important to create something more challenging and less suited for my taste. I thank my teacher for this opportunity to learn about the major differences in teacher and student based projects and for the chance to learn more efficiently.  Teacher based projects prove to be superior according to many people. They are also a better learning tool and they create a more efficient learning environment for students. Without these projects students would be less obedient and wouldn't show as much respect to their authoritative figures. These projects are able to play a major factor in the curriculum taught by the schooling systems. And they are important to the growth of young individuals.¬†¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†		0
Its not a good to thing to come up with some new technologie because you probabaly dont know what people been through.

Do you think drivless cars are safe? Someday everyone in this world might have a car that can drive itself. For this reason I think driveless cars should be given a try and be used by others in the world. Having drivelss cars may also be better for the environment.  Having driveless cars is a very cool and interesting thing, but it can also be very dangerous. I am all for having driveless cars but there are some dangers and questions that come with that. Such as "How do we know that the technology is up to par?"and "Will it know when to exactly tell me when i need to take over?". It can also be dangerous because the may be driving in the right direction, but you have people that get out of control or do dumb things when driving. Sometimes it might not be you or the cars fault.  The article says that the driveless cars "would use have of the fuel od today's taxis." Having the cars use less fuel will help the environment function better and it would cut down on some pollution. Pollution now days is very bad due to more factories being built and more crisis evolving in the world.  So I think driveless cars are a good thing. There just needs to be moremodifications and research done on having them. Driveless cars could be a way to cut down on pollution. I think manufacturers should give it a try and see what the turn out is.                		0
 Driverless cars are an innovative and rapidly advancing technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about transportation. These vehicles use a combination of cameras, sensors, and artificial intelligence to navigate roads autonomously, without the need for a human driver.  One of the most significant benefits of driverless cars is their ability to reduce traffic accidents caused by human error. Human error is a leading cause of traffic accidents, accounting for up to 90% of all accidents on the road. With driverless cars, the responsibility for safe driving falls on the vehicle's artificial intelligence system, which can be designed to operate at a much higher level of perfection than a human driver.  Driverless cars also have the potential to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. With their advanced sensors and cameras, these vehicles can communicate with each other and coordinate their movements, allowing them to travel safely and efficiently through heavy traffic.  Additionally, driverless cars could provide new mobility options for those who are unable to drive, such as the elderly or disabled individuals. These individuals could easily and safely use a driverless car to travel to doctor's appointments, run errands, or participate in community events.  Despite these potential benefits, there are also concerns about the safety and reliability of driverless cars. There is a risk that an AI system might not be able to handle unexpected situations, such as inclement weather or construction. Additionally, there are concerns about the security of these vehicles, as they will store sensitive data such as GPS coordinates and personal information.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize transportation by improving safety, reducing congestion, and providing new mobility options. While there are concerns about the safety and reliability of these vehicles, they represent a promising new technology that has the potential to drastically change the way we think about transportation. As this technology continues to evolve, it will be crucial to address these concerns and ensure that driverless cars can be safely and effectively integrated into our transportation systems.		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for the Electoral College. As a high school student, I have been learning about the history of our government and the different ways that we elect our leaders. I believe that the Electoral College is the best way to ensure that the President represents the interests of all Americans.  The Electoral College is a system in which each state is allocated a number of electors equal to its number of representatives in Congress. These electors are chosen by the voters in each state, and they are responsible for casting the votes that elect the President.  The Electoral College has several advantages over a popular vote. First, it prevents a few large states from dominating the election. If we elected the President by popular vote, candidates would only need to campaign in a handful of states with the largest populations. This would mean that the needs of smaller states would be ignored.  Second, the Electoral College helps to ensure that the President is someone who can appeal to a broad range of voters. A candidate who only appeals to a small group of voters would not be able to win the Electoral College. This means that the President will be someone who can represent the interests of all Americans.  Finally, the Electoral College helps to protect our democracy from foreign interference. If we elected the President by popular vote, it would be much easier for foreign countries to influence our elections. By having the electors cast the votes, it is more difficult for foreign countries to rig the election.  I urge you to support the Electoral College. It is the best way to ensure that the President represents the interests of all Americans.  Sincerely,  A Concerned High School Student		1
How can a facial action coding system can identify a persons initial facial exspretion? Well what it does and how it can be helpful, useful and then it can solv a lot of mystreys in some cases. If somebody can tell what feelings there exspressing can be helpful in a way by telling somebody like a doctors that studys people when there just angry, sad or happy. And that tecnology can help when others are in a certain state of depresion and that certain somebody doesent want to be noticed that machine can help with a person they may commit suicide. When no one knows it but the machiene can tell if there just trying to put on a good face over a really bad time. So then how can it be useful it will also sovle some unusal cases like some artisis make and no one will ever understand what they were trying to go for inside the person. Like the Mona Lisa some people will probably never understand what if just is smiling or grining for the picture. If this invention coms out permanatly that it can show a poll of how kids view homework and then show how some people view work places. If they are dicustuing or just p a place you dont want to goto. Then it also solves the basic stuff like make face detecting how people fell about some presidents andit can solve cases if a person was happy or he was mad to tell if a person was a killer or not. So in conclusion I think it is very useful in my opinon and I hope they make more of these inventions		0
As an eighth-grade student, I believe that seeking guidance from experts and authorities is crucial in making important decisions in life. It is not always easy to navigate through life's challenges and make the right choices, especially when it comes to significant decisions that have long-term consequences. However, with the help of experts and authorities, individuals can benefit from their knowledge, experience, and expertise to make better decisions.  One of the significant benefits of seeking guidance from experts and authorities is that it helps individuals avoid making costly mistakes. For example, when it comes to financial decisions, seeking advice from a financial advisor can help individuals avoid making investment decisions that could result in significant financial losses. A financial advisor can provide valuable insights into the market trends, risk management strategies, and investment options, which can help individuals make informed decisions that align with their financial goals.  Similarly, seeking guidance from medical professionals can help individuals make informed decisions about their health. Medical professionals have the knowledge and expertise to diagnose and treat medical conditions, and they can provide valuable advice on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle. For example, seeking advice from a nutritionist can help individuals make better food choices that align with their dietary needs and goals, which can improve their overall health and well-being.  Moreover, seeking guidance from experts and authorities can also help individuals gain a broader perspective on life's challenges. For example, seeking advice from a career counselor can help individuals explore different career paths and make informed decisions about their education and career goals. A career counselor can provide insights into the job market, industry trends, and skill requirements, which can help individuals make better decisions about their education and career paths.  In conclusion, seeking guidance from experts and authorities is crucial in making important decisions in life. It can help individuals avoid making costly mistakes, gain a broader perspective on life's challenges, and make informed decisions that align with their goals. By seeking guidance from experts and authorities, individuals can benefit from their knowledge, experience, and expertise to make better decisions that lead to more successful outcomes in life.		1
When you're voting for a president to govern our country, your vote should count just as much as anyone else's. The political way of voting right now, is by using electoral college. You cast your vote thinking that your voting for a president when actually your voting for that candiadates electors. Electoral college is unfair, irrational, and could have some really serious consequences.  Electoral college is not fair at all to the people voting. When you vote for president, most of the time you think that your voting for the person that you think will really help to improve this country. With electoral college, you might as well just vote directly for the electors. If all your vote is doing is going to the electors, then presidential candidates shouldn't even advertise themselves because in the end your not voting for them, your voting for the electoral college for that candidate.  The presidental candidates don't go to all the states when runing. They simply go to the states that they know will support them and the states that will most likely vote against them. What about all the other states that arent neccesarly with or against the candidate? They don't ever see any advertisments for the candidates, the person in the presidental race doesnt go to see them, and so when they vote they are basically blindsited by the name on the ballet. It's completly irrational to only go to the states that love you or hate you.  The best argument against the electoral college is something called the disaster factor. To make a long story short, basically it's that the state legislatures pick the electors, and those electors could always defy the rights and will of the people. For example, you could vote for a presidental candidate, but his/her electors cast their vote for the opposing candidate. That's taking away your right to vote for the person that you want to win.  When voting, your vote should go to the person that you chose. Not who the electoral college for that person called. Electoral collages have so many flaws in the system. It's unfair to the people voting, not all the states get as much exposure to the candidate as others, and the system could totally collapse on itself if the electors dont vote for the person that you voted for. That is why popular voting is the best way to elect a political figure. Your vote is going to the person you choose, not to the person someone else chooses for you.       ¬†    		0
Community service is a crucial aspect of a student's education. While some argue that it is too much work, I firmly believe that requiring students to participate in community service is essential for their personal growth and development.  On the one hand, some people argue that community service takes away from the academic focus of school. They claim that students should be spending more time studying and preparing for exams, rather than volunteering at a local soup kitchen or participating in a clean-up initiative. However, I believe that these activities are not only beneficial for the community, but also for the students themselves. Volunteering allows students to gain practical experience and develop important skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. These skills are not only valuable in a career setting, but also in everyday life.  Moreover, community service provides students with an opportunity to give back to their community and make a positive impact. By participating in these activities, students learn the value of empathy and compassion, and understand the importance of contributing to the greater good. This can lead to a more well-rounded and compassionate individual, which is essential for success in today's society.  On the other hand, some argue that requiring community service is too much work for students. They claim that students already have a heavy academic load, and adding community service on top of that can be overwhelming. However, I believe that this is a misconception. Community service can actually complement a student's academic work, rather than detract from it. For example, a student who participates in a science fair can use their knowledge of science to design and implement a sustainable solution for a local community organization. This not only helps the community, but also helps the student to apply their knowledge in a real-world setting.  In conclusion, requiring students to participate in community service is essential for their personal growth and development. While some may argue that it is too much work, I believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. By participating in community service, students can develop important skills, give back to their community, and become more well-rounded individuals. Ultimately, I believe that community service should be a requirement for students, as it provides them with a unique opportunity to make a positive impact on their community and themselves.		1
In today's world, cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives. They have revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and even learn. While some argue that cell phones are a distraction and a hindrance to education, others believe that they are a valuable tool that can enhance the learning experience. In this essay, I will examine the pros and cons of using cell phones for education and consider if they are beneficial for students in the classroom.  On the one hand, cell phones have the potential to be a valuable tool in the classroom. They can provide students with access to a wealth of information and resources that can enhance their learning experience. For example, students can use their cell phones to access educational apps and games that can help them learn new concepts and skills. Additionally, cell phones can be used as a tool for collaboration and communication. Students can use their cell phones to work together on projects and assignments, share information and resources, and communicate with their teachers and classmates.  On the other hand, cell phones can also be a distraction and a hindrance to education. They can be used for non-academic activities such as social media, gaming, and texting, which can take away from students' focus and concentration in the classroom. Additionally, cell phones can be a source of cheating and plagiarism, as students can use them to access information and resources that they should not have access to.  In conclusion, while cell phones have the potential to be a valuable tool in the classroom, they can also be a distraction and a hindrance to education. It is important for teachers and students to use cell phones in a responsible and ethical manner, and to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of using them in the classroom. Ultimately, whether or not cell phones are beneficial for students in the classroom will depend on how they are used and the level of responsibility and ethical behavior exhibited by both teachers and students.		1
Dear Principal Smith,   I am writing to respectfully express my views against changing our school's policy to require students to have at least a B average in order to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. While maintaining good grades is important, such a strict requirement may end up punishing many deserving students and being counterproductive.   Requiring a B average would disqualify a large portion of our student body from activities. Many students who currently have a C average work very hard and contribute greatly to our teams and clubs. For some students, participating in an activity helps motivate them to do better in school. Taking this opportunity away could negatively impact their academic performance instead of improving it. As long as students are passing their classes and making an effort, extracurriculars can provide an important educational experience outside the classroom.  Activities teach crucial life lessons like teamwork, leadership, time management, and responsibility. They also help promote student well-being by encouraging an active lifestyle and social engagement. Rather than exclusion, these benefits argue for inclusion. A C average demonstrates students are meeting the minimum expectations and not failing classes. Their participation should be determined by factors like behavior, effort, and coaches' evaluations‚Äînot an arbitrary letter grade.    A more constructive approach may be to create academic support programs. For example, students below a B could be required to attend weekly study sessions. This would help them utilize coaching staff as mentors while still allowing their involvement in activities. An enriched learning environment benefits everyone.  In closing, while maintaining academic standards is important, an overly restrictive policy risks doing more harm than good. I strongly believe the current guidelines of requiring a C average strike the right balance of accountability and opportunity. Thank you for considering the students' perspective on this important issue.  Sincerely, [Your name]		1
In today's world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain one's individuality. With the rise of social media and the constant bombardment of information, it is easy to get caught up in the opinions of others and lose sight of who we truly are. In this essay, I will explore the challenges of maintaining individuality in a world that is highly influenced by the opinions of others and the importance of staying true to who we are.  One of the biggest challenges of maintaining individuality is the pressure to conform to societal norms and expectations. This can be seen in many aspects of our lives, from the clothes we wear to the hobbies we pursue. For example, many people feel pressure to dress in a certain way in order to fit in with their peers, even if they don't feel comfortable doing so. This can lead to a loss of self-expression and a lack of confidence in one's own identity.  Another challenge of maintaining individuality is the constant barrage of information and opinions from the media and social media. It is easy to get caught up in the latest trends and to lose sight of our own values and beliefs. This can lead to a lack of critical thinking and a lack of discernment, as we blindly follow the opinions of others without considering the source or the validity of the information.  In addition to these external pressures, maintaining individuality can also be a challenge within ourselves. It can be difficult to stay true to our own values and beliefs when we are faced with criticism or opposition from others. It takes a lot of self-confidence and self-awareness to stand up for what we believe in and to resist the pressure to conform to the opinions of others.  Despite these challenges, it is important to maintain our individuality. As the famous poet, Ralph Waldo Emerson, once said, "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail." By staying true to who we are and expressing our own unique identity, we can find a sense of fulfillment and purpose in our lives. We can also inspire others to do the same, and to embrace their own individuality.  In conclusion, maintaining individuality in a world that is highly influenced by the opinions of others can be a challenge. However, it is important to stay true to who we are and to resist the pressure		1
 Duke Ellington, a jazz legend of his time, once said, "A problem is a chance for you to do your best." This quote carries a profound message that has the potential to inspire and motivate individuals to overcome their challenges. In this essay, I will explore the meaning behind this quote and offer my perspective on whether I agree or disagree with it.  The essence of this quote is that problems can be turned into opportunities for personal growth and development. By facing and addressing a problem head-on, individuals can learn from their experiences and improve their abilities. This quote encourages people not to give up on their problems but instead to see them as chances to do their best.  I strongly agree with this statement. In fact, many successful people have turned their failures and setbacks into stepping stones towards achieving their goals. For example, Thomas Edison failed thousands of times before finally inventing the light bulb, but he used each failure as a learning opportunity to refine his design. Similarly, J.K. Rowling faced numerous rejections before finding a publisher for her Harry Potter series, but she persevered and eventually became one of the most successful authors of all time.  Duke Ellington himself may have faced his own set of problems and turned them into opportunities for growth. As a jazz musician, he faced competition from other talented artists and had to constantly innovate and improve to stay relevant. However, he used these challenges as motivation to push himself to new heights and become one of the most celebrated jazz musicians of his time.  In conclusion, I believe that Duke Ellington's quote, "A problem is a chance for you to do your best," carries a powerful message that can inspire individuals to overcome their challenges and achieve their goals. While not all problems can be turned into opportunities, the mindset of seeing challenges as chances to do one's best can help individuals develop the resilience and determination needed to succeed in life.		1
 The Face on Mars has fascinated people for as long as anyone can remember. From the first astronauts that landed on the planet to the most recent rovers, the image of a human-like face staring back at them has sent shivers down their spines. While the face may be a product of human imagination, recent discoveries have shown that there is much more to it than meets the eye.  The first sighting of the Face on Mars was in 1997 when the Mars Observer satellite captured a series of images that appeared to show a human-like head. It was up to NASA to determine whether the images were real or not, and after much analysis, they concluded that the head was a result of shadows and rocks on the surface of the planet. The famous image that most people have seen is not of a living being, but simply a trick of light and shadow.  However, recent discoveries have changed everything. Scientists have found evidence that there may have been life on Mars in the past, and the Face on Mars may have been a product of that life. Researchers have discovered traces of organic molecules on the planet, which are the building blocks of life. These molecules were found on both the surface and in underground caves, suggesting that the organic molecules may have originated from living beings.  The discovery of the Face on Mars has sparked a renewed interest in colonizing the planet. Scientists believe that with the right technology, it may be possible to terraform Mars and make it habitable for humans. If this is the case, the Face on Mars may not be just a fascinating curiosity but a valuable resource for future generations.  In conclusion, the Face on Mars has captivated people's imaginations for centuries. While it may not be a living being, recent discoveries have shown that there may have been life on the planet in the past and that the Face on Mars may be a valuable resource for future generations. As we continue to explore the depths of the universe, the Face on Mars may serve as a reminder of the boundless possibilities that lie beyond our current understanding of the universe.		1
Dear Principal,  I would like to take a position in doing community service . I think everyone should help out to make this a better world and it will stop some students from littering and doing stuff that make our community look so bad. In my opinion I think since students decide to litter and not have a problem with it then , I think they shouldn't have a problem with helping to clean it up . Then again some students have things to do like sports or maybe even baby-sit.  Next , I think it is nice for some students to be involved in tutoring elementary students . It is a fun experience and will make me feel good about myself . But , some students at this school aren't really good role models for the elementary kids . So I disagree with every students being forced to do this . For example : some students do drugs or are involved in gangs , say a lot of profanity , and "sag". Most of the elementary kids look up to us and if they see older kids doing that they would probably think it is appropriate and cool so they would want to do it .  Finally , I think us students should help out on serving lunch every now and then . I use to do that in my elementary school and I had fun doing it . It is fun to experience and I appreciated the lunch workers more . Maybe sweeping up the gym , the blacktop, and the cafeteria every now and then would be okay .  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
Although the usage of motorized vehicles such as cars and motorcycles still remains at large, there is a significant amount of the global population that have realized the advantages of limited automobile usage. Cars and other diesel or gasoline dependant vehicles emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, which eventually lead to the progression of global warming. Not only this, but whether we notice it or not, cars and the spaces that are required to house cars take up valuable space that we can use for agriculture, the stimulation of the economy through the purchase of goods, even for progression of our education. The using of motorized vehicles is not something that should be banned by suburban life, but it, like its predecessor the transportation means by horse hauling has started to become obsolete.  As shown by Vauban, Germany, a community in which the usage of cars is virtually nonexistent, the extinction of car usage is something to be welcomed like a weight being lifted off the responsible shoulders of your average driver. Driving is not only a what is now viewed as a necessary activity for daily living, but it is also a hazardous chore that we as common citizens must place on ourselves on a borderline daily basis. When driving, we are subjecting our safety to the hands of chance, leaving our lives susceptible to being taken from us by an irresponsible driver, someone who we will most likely never cross paths with again.  "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," says a member of the carfree community Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. Aside from health related deaths, death by car accident is not something that is unheard of, it is actually one of the top theives of life found in the United States alone. It is estimated that a death of a teenager ages 1620 resulting from a car accident happens every 16 seconds. Without cars to drive, there would be no way these accidents may occur.  Within the last century, the rate of global warming has skyrocketed in an almost terrifying way. The natural process that would normally take several millennia to take place without the interference made by humans has been nearly cut by threequarters with the technological advancements that we as a species have made. In three of the four sources, it has shown that the emissions made by fossil fuel dependant vehicles have been the biggest contribution to the advancement of global warming. It is even shown in the article written by Robert Duffer that even a partial ban of car usage in Paris was able to reduce the amounts of smog there significantly.  In two of the articles, it has been shown that with the reduction of car usage, the space that was once consumed completely by these motorized psychological traps can be used to further flourish our enviornment with shopping malls, schools, parks and health centers that are readily available to us. Although we may not notice on a regular basis, but the amount of space that is used to give drivers a place to drive and to give cars a place to inhabit is more than likely bigger than the amount of space that we give an average citizen to live in. In Vauban, Germany 5,500 residents are able to live within a rectangular square mile, whereas a majority of that space in a place like Miami, Florida would be made vacant in terms of living, but prosperous in terms of space taken up by cars. In Bagota, Columbia as a result from their yearly "Carfree day" has increased their amount of publicly availabel park and sports center, and have also improved the sidewalks that are readily available to its citizens.  Physical activity has always been promoted, since we were small children who are incapable of driving. Some would say that we were conditioned to view exercise as the best alternative to driving, and it turns out that our conditioning has been proven as fruitful. Within the last several years, the amount of miles driven per person has decreased by nine percent as shown in the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the amount of those looking to receive their driver's liscense has also decreased. This is not because the generation of millennials has viewed driving as something not to their interest, but because we are conditioned to not want to partake in it. Even if our conditioning was not intentional, it has proven fruitful in terms of the improvement of our awareness of both human lives and the enviornment. Both cars and driving are making their way to ineffeciency, and that is not a bad thing. The lack of cars on the road is something to look forward to, both for our ability to look forward to new technological advancements in transportation and for our longevity as a species.		0
There are billions of people in this world and everyone learns differently. Normally, students will take their classes in person at a public or private school. Distant learning should be another method of education that students are allowed to try out. This allows students to learn the same topics anyone else would but with the luxury of being at home. Distant learning would be beneficial because it can provide students a way to learn responsibility,allow¬†them to learn at their own style, and provides safety.  Firstly, by providing distant learning students are able to establish important life skills such as responsibility. This program will allow students to take responsibility on their own by getting their work done. This means the students will have to establish their time management skills so that they complete all of their lessons,quizzes,tests and homework on their own. This is an essential life skill because in the real world no one will be holding their hand or checking up on them to make sure they do what their supposed to. This is great because students can become self motivated to get their stuff done and do this all in their own style.  Secondly, distant learning allows students to learn at their own style. This means students will have the liberty to work at their own pace and use their own methods. There are plenty of different kinds of learners and everyone learns material at different paces. Some people learn material quickly whereas others need more time to fully understand the material. Students will also be able to use the internet to find methods that work best for them. For example, one student can find the general way math is taught easier and others are able to find new ways to learn math that work best for them. This way students can learn however works best for them but still be able to understand and get through all the same material everyone else does.  Lastly, being able to learn from home provides safety to the students. Nowadays there are many concerns from parents about their children going to school because of school shooting,fires, and many other circumstances. By students being able to get their education at home, this brings reassurance to parents that their children will be safe. This also allows parents to make sure their children are being fed good food and are provided with all the resources they need. The students being at home lifts a weight off parents shoulders and eliminates their fear of their child being in any kind of danger.  In conclusion, distant learning should be allowed as an option for students to take. Although, some may say that students need a teacher for guidance but students shouldn't depend on one because their won't always be someone there to guide them. Distant learning builds essential skills such as responsibility that is needed in the real world. It also provides a safe environment for students to learn in and gives parents a sense of relief about their safety. Finally, distant learning gives all different types of people a way to learn that is unique to them because everyone is different and everyone deserves a right to seek education.¬†		0
Phones and Driving  Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving.  According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone puts drivers at a four time greater risk of a crash. Despite the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to always be available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that a hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. However, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.  Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to a tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to losing control over the car. "Even though we as humans recognize that talking or texting on a cell phone or using social media apps while driving is unsafe, they often engage in these behaviors anyway"(Foss and Teft). So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.  Opponents also say that a hands-free set is safe because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Research shows that using a headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. "In 2017, distracted driving was reported in crashes that killed 3,166 people (8.6 percent of all facilities), although many instances may go unreported" (Foss and Teft). It's also proven that people talking over the phone image of the person who they are talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrians step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time which may cause an accident because of lack of manoeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particular time.  Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is an illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in a car. "Texting while driving is the most dangerous activity on the road, even more dangerous than drinking and driving" ("Injured in a Car Accident by Someone Using a Cell Phone"). People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable."You cannot drive safely unless the task of driving has your full attention. Any non-driving activity you engage in is a potential distraction and increases your risk of crashing"(Andrew Currin). Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations .  Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and other people's lives.

There are many things that could go wrong with the way we the United states are voting now which is why we should use election by popular vote. There are many reasons why we should switch to popular vote but there are three that are most important. The candidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though he won the popular vote, it would be less likely to get a tie, and the candidate would have to campaign in every state because there wouldn't be a winnertakesall situation.  Most importantly the candidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though they received the popular vote. The representative electors have the final say in who is elected because they are the ones that put in the votes. An example of this is Al Gore back in 2000. According to some polls Al Gore lost the election thanks to the electoral college because he won the popular vote but still lost the election. Al Gore had recieved more individual votes than George W. Bush but still lost. george W. Bush had 271 electoral votes to Al Gore's 266. However, this is not the last time this will happen and voters can expect to see it happen again in the future were the popular vote winner loses the presidency.  Not only can they win the popular vote but still lose the presidency, they also risk the event of a tie were the vote would then go to the House of Representatives. In the event of a tie meaning that each candidate got an equal number of votes from the electors the House of Representatives would have the opportunity to vote for the president. This is not a fair system in any way because that would mean the representative for Wyoming who is only representing 500,000 thousand people would have as much say as a representative from California who is there representing 35 million voters! There has been many close incidents of a tie so it is possible for this to happen. In 1968 a shift of 41,971 votes would have put the election in a tie. In 1976, id 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii would have voted the other way then the race for presidency would have gone into the hands of the House.  Furthermore the candidates would have to campaign in every state because there wouldn't be winnertakesall which means the winner of the electoral votes gets all the votes within that state even if some of the residents did not vote for that party. The candidates would have to campaign in every state rather than just the "swing" states which are people that have not yet decided which way they wanted to vote. the cenidates dont campaign in a state if they know that they have no chance of winning the electoral votes in that state. During the 2000 election a remarkable seventeen states did not see the campaign one time nor did the people in the 25 largest media markets see a campaign ad whether it be on t. v., in the newspaper, or over the radio. If the president was elected by popular vote than every state would be considered a swing state.  In conclusion the President of the United States should be elected by popular vote because a candidate would not have to worry about winning the popular vote but losing the election, the possibility of a tie would decrease, and the candidate would havw to campaign in every state. These are just a few of the many reasons that we should switch over to a popular vote system, plus who wouldnt wan't to have a little more say in who runs our magnificent country.		0
I had fun joining the Seagoing Cowboys program and so will you. If you join you will have so much fun you will want to join again.  I think others should join in the Seagoing Cowboy program because it"s so much fun and not only that but you can travel to many places and also help others. The places that I went to were across the Atlantic Ocean and to China. When we were doing our crossings careing for animals kept me busy. It was alot of hard work but it also was fun. On my secon trip I stayed overnight as a watchman. Other places I went to were Venice Italy, Greece and along the Panama Canal. I also found time to play on board. We played baseball, volleyball, table-tennis,fencing, boxing, reading and whittling. Being a Seagoing wasnt just an adventure for me it opend the world to me. I am grateful that I took the opportunity.  I hope you can take my essayto make you think about being joining the Seagoing Cowboy program. Trust me you will never regret joining.                                                                                      		0
Many teachers worry that over the summer break the students will forget most of the stuff they learned last year. The solution to that problem is to assign summer assignments to complete over the summer break. But there has been an argument over whether it should be teacher designed or student designed. I believe¬†that the assignments should be teacher designed because it provides a challenge for the students. It also shows how the teacher teaches and what kind of work she gives.¬†Lastly if the student is having problem with the assignment they could contact the teacher for help.  The first reason that teacher should assign the summer assignment is because it provides a challenge to the students. If the students were gonna design the assignment they would make it easy so they wouldn't have to put much effort into doing the work. If the teacher designed the assignment it would require hard work¬†and more effort and time in completing the assignment. They won't be preposterous, just hard enough so that a challenge is provided. Giving the students challenging summer assignments would get them ready to take the class they are taking next year.  The second reason that teacher should assign the summer assignment is because it gives a glimpse of how the class is taught. If the teacher designs the summer assignment it would show the students what kind of work the teacher gives and then they could start to get used to his/her teaching method. It would also help parents know what to do if during the school year the student doesn't get used to the teaching methods. The students will also know ahead of time if they have issues with they way the teacher teaches, and better prepare themselves. it would also help them during the school year because they already know how the teacher teaches the class and what kind of work he/she assigns.  The third reason that the teacher should assign the summer assignment is because if there is an issue the student is having with the assignment they could contact the teacher. If a student is having trouble understanding or doing the problem the teacher could easily be contacted by her school email. If their friends are having the same problems, in the email he/she can tell her that she¬†is¬†not the only one that's having problem so the teacher doesn't have to reply to innumerable emails. If the summer assignment was student designed it would be really hard to get in touch with the student if they are having a problem. if the student did design the summer assignment he/she wouldn't help as much as the teacher that teaches the subject would help you.  As you can see, allowing these summer assignment designed by the students unquestionably be beneficial for the students. Moreover, the worry is that the teacher would make these too hard, but the teacher understands how students don't want to work over the break, so they know it would be futile to make them immensely difficult. If the summer assignment was designed by the teacher it would be for the sake of students and not the teacher. So that's why i believe the summer assignment should be created by the teacher and not the students, because it will provide certain amount of difficulty for the student, it will show how the teacher handles the class and the work she assigns, and if they are having trouble on the assignment they could easily get in touch with the teacher.   ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
 Martian surface is one of the most intriguing and mysterious places on Earth. With the recent discovery of a 'Face on Mars,' this mystery has only deepened. Some people have gone as far as to suggest that this face was created by extraterrestrial beings. While this is an exciting idea, I strongly believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform, and there is evidence to support this belief.  The first clue to the Face's natural origins comes from its geological location. It is not located in a valley or a canyon but on a flat plain called Tharsis. Additionally, the face's shape and size suggest that it is not something artificially constructed. Instead, it is a product of natural geological processes.  Secondly, the Face's features align with those expected to be created by natural forces. For instance, its curved, wave-like structure and its smooth texture are reminiscent of volcanic formations. Indeed, the article states that the Face formed from the volcanic eruption in Martian times and that its features were sculpted by wind and water. The article also notes that the Face is not unique in the Martian landscape as there are several other volcanic features on this planet, like Olympus Mons and Maokong Vallis, which have similar wave-like formations and are also devoid of any signs of extraterrestrial activity.  Furthermore, the Face's composition also supports the idea that it is a natural landform. Volcanic activity typically produces materials that are rich in magnesium, aluminum, and calcium. In contrast, the material that makes up the Face is composed of sulfur, which is not commonly found in volcanic deposits. However, sulfur is abundant on Mars, and it can be produced by the planet's volcanoes. Thus, the Face's composition is consistent with its natural origins.  In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a natural landform, likely produced by a volcanic eruption in Martian times. Its geological location, its features, and its composition all support this conclusion. While the idea of extraterrestrial life on Mars is exciting, it is not supported by the evidence at hand, and it is more important that we focus on discovering the secrets of the planet through scientific investigation.		1
Although some say students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they might not take it serious, actually students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it is more relaxing and even if students go somewhere or get a emergancy they can still attends the classes online.  Eventhough students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home there is some students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they might not take it serious. Some students this way might not pay attention. Also they can use thier phone or do other stuff while the teacher is teaching and their grades could go down fast.  Students would benefit from being able to attend clases from home because it is more relaxing. This way students don't have any stress over getting class on time or missing any classes. Also students it is more relaxing because it is just yourself and the computer. So this way you don't have to worry about other kids or anything that would distract you. In a regular classroom at school there is some kids that distract the entire class and you just feel so hopeless because you are trying to learn but you are too distracted by the other kids. This way you can focus more and learn better.  Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because even if the students go somewhere or they got a emergancy you can still attend the classes online. This will benefit the students because it will minimize the days that you can't attend school. Also if you had a emergancy and have to go somethere far away you can still attend school by online. Also if you broke a bone on your leg or something and you can't walk you might miss a lot of classwork and lessons that are important to you. For this online classes are easy for you.  In conclusion eventhough some say students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they might not take it serious, actually students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it is more relaxing and even if students go somewhere or get a emergancy they can still attends the classes online.   ¬†		0
Ok, So some people believe that the "Unmasking The Face On Mars" was created by aliens. Crazy right!  Well the Face On Mars is just a natural landform. to back my opinon about this it states in the passage that, " A spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landings sities for its sister ship Viking 2, when spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face." so technicaly thats how the face ofn the mars got there but, thats not it. "Scientist figured it was another Marthian mesa, common enough around Cydonia." Then the huge rock formation it resembled a human head which was formed be the shadows that were giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. This would be a good way to engage the public and attraction to Mars the authors had thought. Then it began to starr in a Hollywood film, appreaed in books, magazines, radio talk shows and ect. But NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. but in the mean time defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient cilvilization on mars. but to be dirct the face on Mars was located at 41 degree north martian latitude where it was winter in April. well there is much more to this but this is some of the reasons and facts about how the face on mars was a natural landform.		0
Schools that offer students to do classes online or by other means are great for students who have problems whether they medical, physical or other.  Students with medical problems like a sickness that can be spread around. Students with physical problems like a heart condition or are disabled in certain areas that prevent them to get to schools even if some schools have a form of transportation made for them they may feel uncomfortable with students who are not. Students with¬†problems such as anxiety and other such condition can prevent the students from coming to school.  One other problem that cause students to learn at home could be the parents as some don't trust the school to keep their children safe or they do not believe they teach their children properly and may want to hire someone else.  These reasons are why I think this type of learning can benefit students who learn like this as it can give them a comfortable environment to learn in whether or not they have a condition.		0
Virginia, the Old Dominion State, is rich in history and culture, offering a plethora of museums and parks for visitors to explore. As an 8th grader, I'm excited to share some of these amazing places and the educational programs available for students during vacation.  One of the most iconic museums in Virginia is the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. This museum showcases historic aircraft and spacecraft, including the Wright Brothers' Flyer and the Apollo 11 command module. Students can participate in interactive exhibits and educational programs, such as the "Astronaut Encounter" where they can meet real astronauts and learn about their experiences in space.  Another must-visit museum is the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond. This museum features an extensive collection of art from around the world, including works by famous artists such as Monet, Van Gogh, and Picasso. Students can participate in guided tours and hands-on activities, such as painting and sculpture classes.  For outdoor enthusiasts, Virginia has plenty of parks and historic sites to explore. Shenandoah National Park is a stunning park with breathtaking views, hiking trails, and waterfalls. Students can participate in ranger-led programs, such as wildlife surveys and geology hikes.  Jamestown Settlement in Williamsburg is another historical site that offers interactive exhibits and living history demonstrations. Students can learn about the first English settlers and their way of life, including their homes, food, and crafts.  Teachers, if you're reading this, you might want to consider taking advantage of Virginia's vacation days during school breaks to bring your classes to these amazing places. Imagine the learning opportunities for your students to see history come alive in front of their eyes!  In conclusion, Virginia is a treasure trove of history and culture, offering a wide range of museums and parks for students to explore. Whether you're interested in aviation, art, or history, there's something for everyone in the Old Dominion State. So why not plan a trip to Virginia during the next school break and make some unforgettable memories?		1
Standardized testing has been a topic of debate for many years, and it is still a controversial issue today. Some people believe that standardized tests are an accurate measure of student ability, while others argue that they are not. In my opinion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability.  One reason why I believe that standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability is that they do not take into account the different learning styles and abilities of students. Every student has a unique way of learning, and some students may not perform well on standardized tests because the tests do not cater to their learning style. For example, a student who is a visual learner may struggle with a standardized test that is primarily focused on reading comprehension.  Another reason why I believe that standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability is that they do not assess all of the skills that a student possesses. Standardized tests typically focus on reading, writing, and math skills, but they do not assess other important skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. These skills are just as important as the skills that are assessed on standardized tests, and they should be taken into consideration when evaluating a student's ability.  Furthermore, standardized tests can be biased against certain groups of students. For example, students who come from low-income families or who speak English as a second language may not perform as well on standardized tests because the tests are not culturally relevant to them. This can lead to a situation where students who are actually very capable are labeled as "low-performing" simply because they did not do well on a test that was biased against them.  In conclusion, I believe that standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. They do not take into account the different learning styles and abilities of students, they do not assess all of the skills that a student possesses, and they can be biased against certain groups of students. Instead of relying solely on standardized tests, we should use a variety of assessment methods to evaluate student ability, including portfolios, projects, and performance-based assessments. By doing so, we can get a more accurate picture of what each student is capable of and help them to reach their full potential.		1
An act of kindness is a voluntary act of generosity. It is a selfless act that can be done with no expectation of recognition or reward. It can range from a simple ‚Äúthank you ?to a hug or to an extreme act such as donating money, volunteering time or helping a complete stranger. The primary outcome of an act of kindness is the feeling of being appreciated and valued. It is known to have a lasting impact on people and improve the overall safety and happiness of those around them.   For example, when a homeless person on the street receives a hot meal or a trinket from a passerby, the feeling of kindness and the appreciation felt can spread, even to those not necessarily involved. It can have a ripple effect within the community, inspiring others to do something kind for someone in need. It can also help build a sense of community, bringing people together that would have otherwise been strangers.  Of course, even the smallest act of kindness can be incredibly powerful. Helping a friend in need, lending a fresher friend some notes, or even merely smiling can make a big difference to someone. The mere gesture of kindness can significantly boost a person‚Äôs self-esteem and even start a chain reaction of kindness.		1
Alone, laying in bed, a bright lap top screen in front of your face, could this idea of distance learning replace a school day? Students would not benefit from distance learning because at home students have more distractions than a school environment and could easily lose focus. To continue, when learning at school, students learn and grow through social interaction with their peers. Having an isolated learning experience at home allows students to miss out out on social cues and friendships.  Distractions are something every human sees in their day to day life. At home students have a wide range of distractions from their cell phone to a basketball. This causes them to always have something else they could be doing rather then sitting down and taking an online class. Additionally, with all these distractions students have to have accountability and a sense of urgency to do their school work. If students are constantly pushing off their school work due to distractions then their education will be at risk.  Going to school helps students learn how to deal with their peers and adults socially. When going to school with their peers students learn problem solving and team building skills as a group. This prepares them for their future jobs and life in the work force by allowing them to understand how to work together. If a student is alone, in bed, and learning through a video it eliminates team building skills they could be learning in a regular classroom.  Some may believe students are better off with distance learning because it eliminates social anxieties and discomfort in the classroom. This is incorrect because in life humans have to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, the only things humans can count on in life is change and discomfort. To continue, students need to be prepared for all types of people and personalities because after school ends and the tests are all over, those people don't go away. If students are not participating in school with their peers because they are more comfortable at home it is teaching them to take the easy way out.  In conclusion, students would not benefit from the ability to attend these classes because it would allow them to put their education at risk and miss out on developing social cues. If all students were to take advantage of the distance leaning option, then it could cause this generation to fall behind academically and socially. If students are allowed to take the easy way out with school, what else will they later take for granted?¬†		0
Gun control is a really important issue that affects lots of people. Some people think we need stricter gun control laws, while others don't. In my opinion, we should have stricter gun control laws because it would make our communities safer.  One reason why we need stricter gun control laws is because of all the shootings that have happened. There have been so many school shootings and mass shootings in the past few years, and it's really scary. If it was harder for people to get their hands on guns, then maybe these shootings wouldn't happen as often. For example, in Australia, they have really strict gun control laws and they haven't had a mass shooting in years!  Another reason is that guns can be really dangerous if they're not handled properly. Some people might say that we should teach kids about gun safety, but accidents can still happen. If there were stricter laws, then maybe people would be more careful with their guns and there would be fewer accidents.  Also, stricter gun control laws would help prevent people who shouldn't have guns from getting them. For example, some people might have a history of violence or mental health issues, and if they had access to guns, it could be really dangerous. Stricter laws would make it harder for these people to get guns and put others in harm's way.  Some people might argue that stricter gun control laws would take away our right to defend ourselves. But I think that's not a good reason to oppose stricter laws. We can still defend ourselves without having to use guns. There are other ways to protect ourselves, like taking self-defense classes or carrying non-lethal weapons, like pepper spray.  In conclusion, stricter gun control laws would make our communities safer and prevent dangerous situations from happening. It's important that we take action to prevent shootings and accidents, and make sure that guns are used responsibly.		1
Climate change is a hot topic nowadays, and it's no surprise why. With the increasing evidence of its effects on our planet, many people are starting to take it seriously. However, there's a debate about whether or not governments should take immediate action to address climate change. In my opinion, I believe that governments should take immediate action to address climate change.  Firstly, climate change is a real and pressing issue. The evidence is clear - the Earth's temperature is rising, sea levels are increasing, and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. These changes are having a significant impact on our environment, and if we don't take action now, it will only get worse.  Secondly, governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens. Climate change poses a threat to our health, safety, and well-being. Heatwaves, floods, and other extreme weather events can cause significant damage to our homes, businesses, and infrastructure. By taking action to address climate change, governments can help to mitigate these risks and ensure that their citizens are safe.  Finally, taking action on climate change can also have economic benefits. Investing in renewable energy and other sustainable technologies can create jobs and stimulate economic growth. Furthermore, by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, we can reduce our vulnerability to fluctuations in oil prices and other energy-related costs.  In conclusion, the evidence is clear - climate change is a real and pressing issue that requires immediate action. Governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens and can also benefit economically by taking action to address climate change. It's time for governments around the world to step up and take action before it's too late.		1
Could students learn more effectively from online courses and video conferencing? In my opinion, students would benefit from being able to take classes at home, it would allow them to feel more comfortable, learn at their own pace, and communicate concisely with teachers.  The benefit of a student being in their own home is quite clear cut. A person feels more comfortable in a place where they spend a majority if their time. I personally have taken an online course at home and being able to do work on my couch was much easier than sitting in a classroom. The comfort of being in my home where I had things the way I wanted them makes things feel easy. Learning when I was in a soft couch rather than a hard backed chair was quite different, but different in a good way. Again, from personal experience, taking a the work load seemed quite a bit more manageable when I was sitting at home. I was also able to get up at anytime to grab a snack of get a drink of water. These abilities made it a lot easier to learn.  Not all people learn at the same pace. Some people just tend to pick up information quicker and some people need to take their time to absorb knowledge. An online, in home, class would make the learning experience even more personal and would be tailored to the person learning. I personally learn quickly and don't need very much time to pick something up. The online class system was perfect for this as it let me complete the next assignment after I had completed the previous one, there was no set deadline for when I had to begin anything. Being able to work at my own pace and follow my own guidelines helped me in the optimal way. For slower learning students, there was a system where you could send a message to you online teacher and request a deadline extension if necessary. The teacher would also send messages to students long in advance of things so that students who needed to take their time could.  Being by oneself in a classroom with a teacher would be the best learning experience possible as one on one teacher is all about one person learning. There is no having to teach other students. While online classes are not entirely one on one, they do have smaller numbers of students enrolled in them. For my online class there was only 9 students in my "class". In a traditional classroom the number of students for that same class may be up to 30. In a class of 30 the teachers attention is divided over a much greater number of students and not every student can get the help that they need. With the online class, a teacher can give students a more personalized teaching experience and can also devote more time to students. With the teacher helping them more, it is most likely that the student will perform better in class. In my class of 9, I was struggling with a certain assignment and I was able to video chat my teacher for 2 hours and understand the material. That would not be possibly in a traditional classroom because a teachers attention would be dividing among¬†multiple students who would need help.  In conclusion, students would greatly benefit from taking classes at home because it would allow for comfortable learning (as a student would be more comfortable at home), custom pace setting (due to looser deadlines), and personal teaching (because class size would be smaller).		0
Limiting car usage has many advantages, both for individuals and the environment. On the individual level, limiting car usage can save money, improve health, and reduce stress levels. For the environment, limiting car usage can reduce air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and traffic congestion.  One of the biggest advantages of limiting car usage is saving money. Cars are expensive to buy, insure, and maintain. When you limit your car usage, you can save money on all of these costs. In addition, you may be able to save money on parking, tolls, and gas.  Limiting car usage can also improve your health. When you drive, you are exposed to air pollution and other pollutants. These pollutants can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Limiting your car usage can help you reduce your exposure to these pollutants and improve your overall health.  Finally, limiting car usage can reduce stress levels. When you drive, you are often stuck in traffic or dealing with other drivers. This can be a stressful experience. Limiting your car usage can help you avoid these stressors and reduce your overall stress level.  On the environmental level, limiting car usage can reduce air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and traffic congestion. Cars are a major source of air pollution. When you limit your car usage, you can help to reduce the amount of air pollution in the environment. Cars also emit greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. Limiting car usage can help to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Finally, cars are a major cause of traffic congestion. When you limit your car usage, you can help to reduce traffic congestion and make it easier for people to get around.  In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages, both for individuals and the environment. If you are looking to save money, improve your health, reduce stress, or help the environment, consider limiting your car usage.		1
People are lining up, waiting for hours on end to vote for a new president of the United States. That president won every single person's vote, but did not become presient. He did not become president because the ellectoral college voted for the other person. That is unfair because no matter what the citizens say, they are not even completly sure that the president they voted for was going to win. For example, in the year 2000, a little bit after Al Gore, they won the popular vote, but they did not win the presidency because they did not win the electoral vote, according to Source 2. Citizens of the United States should be allowed to a direct vote because in 2000, 60 percent of voters voted that they prefer a direct election, and because the voters are not voting for the president, they are voting for a slate of electors.  To begin, according to source 2, "If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes." This quote from Source 2 is explaining what your vote couts for when you go to elect for a president. Those electors are anyoen who doesn not own a public office. Who elects the electors is the state.  In addition, this year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency and yet, the electoral college still has its defenders, states in source 2.  All in all, the electoral college is unfair to voters, because the winner takes it all system does not work in every state.    		0
Dear Principal,  After reviewing the possible cell phone policies I have come to a conclusion that I support Policy 1. This policy allows students to use their cell phones for important or recreational uses that do not distract them during class time. Also with this policy they will be able to set up transportation and be able to feel secure in case of an emergency.  Policy 2 however, I feel will be ineffective and will not aide students in any way. If this policy is chosen students will most likely still bring their cell phones to school and because of the fact that they are not allowed to use them in free time they will most likely have to use them secretly during class. This will distract not only themselves but students around them. Also they may feel almost "dared" to bring their cell phones and try not to get caught.  The reason I feel that Policy 1 would be helpful is because if they are given certain periods of time when they can use them without having to face getting into trouble, the students will feel their is no need to use them during class. This will help them keep focussed during class along with others around them. Also they will be able to keep in touch and check in with their parents or guardians in case of an emergency or and important occurrence.  One of the main reasons students bring or even have cell phones today is for transportation purposes. If students are given a time during lunch or free time to use their cell phones and do this it will cut out the need to bring cell phones into the classroom or anywhere else in the school.  I believe that students will support this policy and respect the rules of it. If Policy 2 is put into play I believe students will take it lightly and not follow the rules. Also they may not feel as safe or secure in their school environment. In all, I believe that Policy 1 will help benefit not only the students but teachers as well and help the school environment become a more safe, secure, and focussed environment.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
Dear Mr. Senator, After reviewing information about the Electoral College, I believe that the Electoral College should not be used in deciding or electing the president of the United States.  "Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for President, but for a slate of electorss, who in turn elect the President." The sitation before states that it is not the President the voters are voting for, it is actually the electorss that the people are voting for, who in turn will vote for the President. This situation does not allow for the people to directly vote for who they believe will be the best President. It is really in the hands of the electorss who will become President.  Secondly, after realizing that the number of electorsal votes decides if you become President or not, the Presidential candidates are going to want to focus on obtaining the most votes as possible. After determining which states they "have in the bag", the candidates are going to put their campaigning efforts toward the "tossup" or "swing states". Here they will have to compete in a tight race between the other party to sway the voters of the state to vote their way. This method of campaigning in the swing states doesn't allow for much campaigning in the big, numerous votes states. An example of this would be that during the 2000 campaign, almost 20 states did not see the candidates at all as well as campaign ads. With the Electoral College system in place, Presidential candidates are focusing more on obtaining the "swing state" votes and not so much on supporting and visiting the states and people they know they have.  Finally, the system of electing electorss who then vote for the President can be considered unpredictable. This being because the electorss could at any time defy the will of the people. These shady electorss, also known as "faithless electorss", can deny to vote for their party's candidate and instead cast the vote for whomever they desire. This shows that it is not the people's choice, instead the choice of the electors. Also, the state legislatures are responsible for choosing the electorss. This could cause an issue where the state legislatures are choosing electorss who will vote for their party. Let's take it back to the 1960's where an example of this corruption almost took place. Segrigationists, or people who favored racial separation, who were state legislatures in the state of Louisiana nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electorss with new electorss who would not vote for John F. Kennedy. This would've caused the popular vote to go to Kennedy's opponent. For the many reasons listed above, the Electoral College could be considered unpredictable and in some cases... shady.  Overall Mr. Senator, I believe that the Electoral College should not be used to determine who becomes the President of the United States instead they should use popular vote. This being because the people are not directly voting, the candidates are just focusing on getting the votes and not on the people. And lastly because it can be considered unpredictable with the "faithless electorss" and bais state legislatures.		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College. As you know, the Electoral College is a system in which each state is given a number of electors equal to its total number of representatives in Congress. Each state then chooses its electors in a manner determined by its own legislature. On Election Day, voters in each state cast their ballots for a presidential candidate and a slate of electors pledged to that candidate. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district.  I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that is no longer fit for purpose. In the 21st century, it is no longer necessary to have a system that gives more weight to the votes of people living in small states. In fact, the Electoral College actually gives less weight to the votes of people living in small states, because those states are often ignored by presidential candidates who focus their campaign efforts on the "battleground" states that are most likely to swing the election.  The Electoral College also leads to the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016 when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes but lost the election to Donald Trump. This is simply not acceptable in a democracy.  I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and adopting a system of direct popular vote for president. This would be the fairest and most democratic way to elect our nation's leader.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
 The Red Planet, otherwise known as Mars, has captured the attention of people for centuries due to its unique features and enigmatic nature. However, one of the most striking and debated features of Mars is the face that appears on its surface from time to time. This face on Mars is a geological formation known as a "mesa," a large, flat area of land elevated above the surrounding landscape.  The face on Mars, which is also known as the "Face of Mars," has been observed for centuries and has been a source of fascination for many. The face appears to many to be human-like, with two large eyes made up of large volcanic craters, a large mouth that appears to be smiling, and features on the face that resemble wrinkles.  The formation of the Face on Mars remains a mystery. Some scientists believe that the face is simply a natural formation, created by the movement of water and wind on the surface of Mars. Others believe that the face is a remnant of an ancient civilization that once existed on Mars.  Some of the people who have seen the face on Mars have been very emotional about it. They have expressed feelings of awe, confusion, and even fear. The face is so mysterious and complex that some people have even tried to decipher its meaning and origins.  Despite the ongoing debate over the fate of the Face on Mars, there is no doubt that it continues to captivate and inspire people all over the world. From scientists and researchers to writers and artists, the face on Mars has been the subject of numerous studies, stories, and poems.  In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a fascinating geological formation that has captured the attention of people for centuries. Whether it is a natural formation or a remnant of an ancient civilization, the face on Mars remains a mystery that continues to intrigue and inspire people.		1
When you seek advice do you ask multiple people for their opinion? If not let me tell you why you should ask more than one person for advice. Asking for advice is a very easy way to get an answer for your situation. Imagine how easier it could get when you have more opinions to choose from. Asking multiple people for advice is a great way to get more than one opinion. Having more opinions gives you more options to choose from,also it gives you an open mind to start thinking about what you need. Therefor it helps you be more understanding when you hear other peoples perspectives.  Asking more than one person for advice is very helpful technique because it helps you make a better decision. Sometimes asking only one person for advice can get very frustrating. The reason why it can get very frustrating is because the one person will just go on and on about how they feel when your the one asking for advice. It can get way to full of opinions and end up changing your choice because you feel forced to. Also when you ask one person for advice it tends to only show you their part of the decision,but when you ask more than one person for advice you can get to see more parts of a whole.  Making your own decision can sometimes get very hard to do all alone. Thats why you should ask multiple people for advice. Asking more than one person for an answer can end you up with a wiser choice. Asking others for help can help you make a great decision and this¬†can benefit your decision making. Dont be afraid¬†to ask more than one person for their opinion because at the end it will help you a lot¬†with making your choice.  Most of my decisions are made by asking others for advice when¬†allowed too. Asking one person for advice does not help nearly as much as asking more than asking multiple people for advice. the reason why asking one person does not help me at all because they make it all about themselves. It makes me think that their decision has to be my decision¬†as well¬†,which isnt true at all. When seeking advice from more than one person it helps me see different parts of my choice. Seeing many parts of my decision can help make it easier for me to pick a choice.  Asking more than one person for advice is the most helpful way to seek advice. It helps you make better choices and helps you see full parts of a decision. When you ask more people you have more opinions, which mean that you have more choices to choose from. Its way easier than making a decision all alone. To sum this all up seeking for advice and or opinions from multiple people is a much better way to ask for advice other than asking one person.¬†		0
Dear state senator,  I beleive that we should get rid of the electoral college. It is unfair to many voters. Because of the winner tak-all system in each state candidats dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focsing only on the tight races in the "swing" states. During the 2000 campaign seventeen states did not seee the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Caronlina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markes did not see a single campaign ad. we should also get rid of the electoral college because of the electoral college they lost 60 percent of the voters who would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.  The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidtate receives¬† majority of the votes casted. For example Nixon in 1968 and cliton in 1992 both had only a 43percent purality of the popular votes, While winning a majority in the Electoral College 301 and 370 ecetoral votes, there is pressure for run-off when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.  But back to electoral college votes being unfair a lot of the states like¬† wyoming north and south dakota knowing they only get three votes that count some people dont even bother voting, I mean I would not want to if i knew that my vote really was not going to make a diffrence.  so yes electoral college votes are good like how obama recived 61.7 percents of the votes out of the 51.3 percents that Romney got, because all states award the winner take-all system. But I think that we should go back to a direct election to make the voting fare to evryone to keep everyone voting and make them feel like we are still one country.    ¬†    		0
Dear Principal,  I have to say I do not agree on this possible policy change. I believe children who have grades below a B average should still be able to participate in school sports and other activities. B' s are considered above average. What about the average people, who really are trying? Can't they still do what they want to do? C' s are considered average and I believe that "average" people with "average" grades should still have the opportunity to play in sports and other activities. I can see how you think that sports may lower their grades even more, being too much of a distraction, but I know that physical activities are something that help the development of your body.  Most Children have at least 4 to 5 hours after school to choose what they want to do. Even when these children are done with their homework they have free time and have the choice on what to do, which usually leads to T.V., video games, eating, computer... exedra. I think if these few extra hours lead to sports, it would be okay. If kids take the time and put in the effort to fit in sports and schooling in one schedule, I think that everything would be great. School was never easy and sports never made it any easier, but at least these kids will experience something they may have been dreaming of doing for a long time. I propose that children with a C average or above in our school should be able to participate in activities and sports.  Sincerely,  Anonymous		0
The concept of always being productive and working is a prevalent one in today's society. However, this mindset can have negative consequences on both our physical and mental health. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of taking breaks and how it can improve the quality of work and creativity, as well as the physical and mental health benefits of taking breaks. I will also examine the arguments in favor of an always-working mentality and explore how taking breaks can improve such a mindset.  Firstly, taking breaks can significantly improve the quality of work and creativity. When we work for extended periods, our minds become fatigued and our productivity declines. Taking breaks, on the other hand, allows our minds to rest and recharge, leading to improved focus and productivity upon returning to work. Additionally, taking breaks can lead to increased creativity and innovation, as our minds are able to think outside the box and come up with new ideas.  Secondly, taking breaks has numerous physical and mental health benefits. Prolonged periods of sitting and working can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can increase the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. Taking breaks can help alleviate these risks by allowing us to move around and stretch our muscles. Additionally, taking breaks can reduce stress and anxiety, which can have negative effects on our mental health.  Despite these benefits, there are arguments in favor of an always-working mentality. Some people believe that taking breaks can lead to a lack of discipline and a decrease in productivity. However, this is not necessarily the case. Taking breaks can actually improve our productivity by allowing our minds to rest and recharge. Additionally, taking breaks can lead to increased motivation and a sense of accomplishment, which can improve our overall sense of well-being.  Personally, I have experienced the benefits of taking breaks firsthand. When I work for extended periods without taking breaks, my productivity declines and my mind becomes fatigued. However, when I take breaks, I am able to recharge and come back to work with renewed focus and energy. Additionally, taking breaks has allowed me to maintain a healthy work-life balance, which has improved my overall well-being.  In conclusion, taking breaks is essential for maintaining our physical and mental health, as well as improving the quality of our work and creativity. While there are arguments in favor of an		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME  I think that kids should not be able to use there phones during school because of many reasons such as, not paying attention in class. Also if kids are aloud to use the phone during a free time might encourage them to use it in class. kids would get into lots more trouble with teachers if they use there phone in class.  First, kids should not be able to use there phone in class because, they will not pay attention in class. If kids are not paying attention in class then kids knowledge is not growing. We really need a smarter generation to help stop important stuff. Like someone in my generation could find a cure for cancer and become rich and successful. Someone in my generation could help the economy and things could be more affordable. also people could be not in debt. That is me first reason kids should not use there phones in school.  Second, If we have a free period of time were we can use are phones then that would cause trouble to because, since there phones are in there pockets it encourages them to use it in class. Also kids are not getting any smarter texting all the time. Soon kids will be using texting in there school reports and start to fail. That is my second reason why kids should not use there phones in school.  Finally, kids would start to fail there classes because, kids would start to into there texting and also calling people. Also kids would start to cheat on test by using there phones in class and getting answers from people. Soon kids would start to get caught and get into lots of trouble.  That is why I think phones should not be used in school.		0
Many scientist have trouble on learnig more about Venus. It may act like it the brightest light in the sky but it`s not the easiest to study. They have a rough time try to discover it because they don`t have the right materials to study the planet. They have sent numerous spacecraft to the land on this clound-fraped world. All of the spacecrafts that have tried to land has never made it back. They have no evidence on what`s on this planet.  Scientist have tried to discover venus but they fail everytime. Do you think it`s because of how thick the atmosphere is with carbon dioxide? The air on Venus is very different that Earth. It makes it difficult because the clouds are filled with highly corrosive sulfuric acid and the average temperature is 800 degress Fahrenheit. The human body can not survive in that type of weather. The environment on venus would crush a submarine with how hot it is. Scientist compare the pressure and the heat to a erupting volcanoes. Will they ever figure out a way to do more studys on Venus.  As more and more people study Venus,they want to figure out how to get there. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particulary compelling idea for spending humans to study Venus. They may have came up with a idea to float above the fray. They want the vehicle to avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and away from the ground. The temperature would still be pretty hot but not as hot as the ground tempertaure. The temperature in the air would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit but the air temperature would be close to the sea level on Earth. As many people study this idea,they will think that the human body would be able to use this method instead of going on the land of Venus. Could you see this happening in the future or not?  Other researchers think that Venus is to inhospitable to visit. They think that many years ago that Venus was just like Earth but they have no evidence to support the claim. On the other hand,how could Venus be like it is today and it like Earth years ago. Did Venus move that far away for it not to be a living place. The planet is a rocky sediment and has valleys,mountains and craters. I would say within a couple of years,scientist will have enough technology to discovert his planet. Would you ever live on this planet if they discover that it is a living place.  With all the evidence and support that scientist have,can Venus be a safe place to live. I think within the next couple years we will truely know what kind of planet it is. Scientist do a good job on studying the planets and any other things they study. I just don`t understand how it was safe man years ago and not anymore. The technology will help us study and get more information we need. I hope to see many people on the Planet Venus in the next couple years.    		0
 The Face on Mars Is a Natural Landmark  Introduction:  The discovery of the face on Mars has sparked a lot of debate about its origin. Some people believe that it was created by aliens, while others argue that it is a natural landform. In this essay, I will argue that the face on Mars is just a natural landmark. I will provide evidence from an article titled 'Unmasking the Face on Mars,' which supports my argument that the face is a natural landmark.  Body:  Firstly, the article highlights that the face is not a recent discovery. It has been seen for centuries by telescopic observations, and the first photographic image was taken in 1976. This suggests that the face is a stable feature and has been present for a long time.  Secondly, the article points out that the face is not a flat image but has depth like a real mountain. This depth is caused by the surface of Mars being tilted, and the sun's light is reflecting off the surface in different ways.  Thirdly, the article describes that the face is made up of many rocks and dust particles which have been eroded over time by wind and water. This means that the face is a result of natural forces acting on the surface of Mars, just like a river or a volcano.  Conclusion:  In conclusion, the face on Mars is a natural landmark. While it may look like a man-made structure to some, it is actually a result of natural forces acting on the surface of Mars. The evidence from the article shows that the face is a stable feature, has depth, and is made up of natural materials. Therefore, it is not a creation of humans, but rather a product of nature. We should appreciate this natural landmark as we continue to study and explore Mars.		1
While summer projects aim to keep students engaged in learning during their break, assigning teacher-designed projects risks feeling too much like schoolwork and deterring intrinsic motivation. Student-designed summer projects strike a better balance.   When students have the freedom to choose their own summer learning activities, they are more likely to select topics that genuinely interest them. This makes the work feel less obligatory and more like an opportunity for self-guided exploration. Students may investigate hobbies, careers they aspire to, or interests sparked from summer experiences. Having autonomy in how they spend their break time fosters independence and self-direction.  Of course, true learning still requires structure and guidance. But student-designed projects can integrate structure in a way that feels supportive rather than restrictive. For example, teachers could provide broad categories of focus areas aligned with the curriculum. Students then choose a specific interest within those categories and design a project with teacher-approved goals and deadlines. This framework balances choice with needed supervision.  Hands-on projects also promote retention of lessons better than rote assignments. For a student passionate about drawing manga, a self-guided project investigating artistic techniques may spark a lifelong skill. Another interested in coding may teach themself a new programming language. When the work stems from personal curiosity, students are intrinsically motivated to challenge themselves and dig deep into a self-selected topic.  In conclusion, while well-meaning, teacher-designed summer assignments risk hampering students' intrinsic motivation and sense of autonomy during their break. Student-designed projects empower students' self-directed learning in a way that feels less like schoolwork. When implemented properly with teacher support, this approach maximizes engagement with summer learning through personally meaningful pursuits.		1
Is a student to be trusted with the same decisions as an experienced teacher, even when the decisions impact them? The decisions in question are summer assignments and if students should be the ones to decide the nature of their assignments or if the teacher should still be the one to make the assignments. I believe it would be best if these summer assignments were teacher-designed because teachers understand what students need to learn, teachers have more experience with structuring these assignments, and because students may purposefully make the assignment effortless to complete.  The first reason these summer assignments should be teacher-designed is that teachers know what information students need to maintain a grasp on. Once summer is done, students tend to forget knowledge that is essential for a smooth learning experience in the upcoming school year. This may slow a student down and affect their learning pace which, in turn, may impede the whole class because the teacher may have to spend time bringing the student to where they need to be in the lesson. This takes time from the curriculum and results in the class falling behind in the schedule that the teacher set in advance. This can be avoided if the students are given a teacher-designed assignment during summer so they already understand the learning materials when the new school year begins. Some may disagree with this and say students may research the learning materials that the assignment must include. Teachers, however, are more familiar with the material for they have been teaching it for many years, they may understand what should and shouldn't be included because they have prior experience with the issue. This understanding of the necessary materials that students tend to forget is a significant factor when considering if the assignment should be student-designed or teacher-designed.  Another reason it makes more sense to have teacher-designed assignments is that teachers have more experience structuring these assignments to make it easy for the student to understand. Many assignments given to students by teachers are assignments used in the past because it is shown that they are efficient in making the material understandable to the students. The reason these assignments are helpful is because the teacher structured them to be easy for the student to understand. Teachers have been teaching for a long time and they know what works and what does not work, and they are able to use their past experience from making assignments to determine the best way for the student to keep the learning materials fresh in their minds. Some may say that this is a good learning experience for students to learn how to structure assignments. This proposition may apply to other situations, but it does not apply to this one because students may have difficulty structuring the assignment, resulting in a confusing structure that may confuse the students completing the assignment over summer. Experience is a very important factor when considering if summer assignments should be student-designed or teacher-designed and teachers have a significant and teachers are significantly more experienced than students.  The final reason a teacher-designed summer assignment would be superior to a student-designed assignment is that students may decide to make the assignment easier for themselves. Though they are beneficial, many students disagree with summer assignments because they believe their summer should be an uninterrupted break from school and education. Since students feel this way, they may purposefully make the assignments much shorter and easier to avoid doing too much work. Students would rather take the easy way to avoid doing work over summer, even if this means they fall behind in the school year. Students would argue that they would make assignments easier and shorter because teacher-designed assignments are too difficult and lengthy. However this argument does not stand because the length and difficulty of the assignments are designed to aid the student in learning, the assignment is not meant to be completed promptly, it is meant to be completed over the course of their long break. This pattern of laziness in students is an important contribution to the idea that summer assignments should not be student-designed.  Though controversial among students, summer assignments have a very important role in students' summers, they ensure that students don't fall behind once they return to school in fall. It is important that these assignments remain teacher-designed as opposed to student designed because teachers understand what materials students must remember, they know how to structure assignments, and unlike students they make the assignments helpful instead of making it easy. It is important to remember how these assignments not only impact the individual student, but how they impact the entire class.		0
Dear principle,  Students should not be required to perform community service. Students should not have to do community service because it is the students time and it should be up to them on how they should use it. The students would be unhappy with this decision and maybe some parents would too. This would cause the school to have unpleasant school days, knowing they will have to do community service when they get home. some families may even move out of the school district because of this. Requiring students to do community service also goes against human rights, nobody is able to make them do community service. It is not justified to make them do community service because you think they should and you are the principle. People will be unhappy with your decision if you go through with this. Students should not be required to do community service because it will be a conflict with their extracurricular and sports activities. Athletes will have to cut practices short because they have to do community service, thus for not allowing them to become better at their sport. if you make the students do community service I am sure many people will be unhappy.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
I think teachers should designed the student summer projects. There are many reasons why teachers should design the project, but the main reasons are the teacher would know how the project will know how the project will be completed. Then teachers will help prepare students for upcoming school year. The teacher should to know how to grade the project correctly. There shouldn't be student designed project because they will most likely forget about it or throw something together for a project.  Firstly , The teachers will know about how the project is supposed to be done. They will know mostly know everything about the project. The teacher will inform the students before they would leave for summer break about the project. The teacher will give examples of the projects about how they are supposed too, and how they don't supposed to look. They will give you details on how you can make your project better. The teacher will hand you out a syllabus on what you need for your project.  Then, The teachers will have a project dealing with the upcoming classes of your semester . The teachers will help them grow in knowledge and in the world. There will be a earlier learning start for students because, They've already worked on it in the summer. The teachers will cover all classes the student have for the upcoming school year. The teachers will have everything in the project for students too learn about for they can all have a early start on there classwork, and have a thought on what we they're working on.  Accordingly , all teacher should make the summer projects for grading the project correctly. They will know what they are looking for in the project. So there will not be just coming up with just any project and putting something together. They will be a syllabus handout before you leave for the you know what's on the project, and what the teacher is looking for. The grading will be hard on the students if they had to grade, So there is why teachers should because they know how to grade the projects.  Finally, These are the three main reason why i will select teachers should design summer projects. There is knowing how the project will need to be done, will help students in upcoming school year, teachers should make projects because of the grading.¬†		0
While the Face on Mars provoked much speculation and debate, scientific evidence shows it is a naturally-occurring landform.   One of my claims is that the formation was created through natural erosion over millions of years. Wind and water wearing away at the rock surface can carve formations that take on unexpected appearances from certain angles, as the article discusses. It notes similar "faces" have been found on other landscapes upon closer inspection. Over long periods of geological time, even random erosion processes can coincidentally align to resemble faces or structures.    Another claim is that images from improved cameras debunked early theories of artificial features. When the Viking orbiter captured higher resolution photographs in 1998, it revealed the Face lacked distinguishing characteristics like eyes or other facial features. It was simply a small mesa and slope composed of layered rock. While intriguing from a distance, up-close analysis showed purely natural patterns and textures.   Additional evidence comes from comparing the Face to known artifacts of ancient civilizations. If visitations from advanced aliens occurred, one would expect to find constructed objects with non-natural properties, advanced alloys or intricate designs that go well beyond what simple weathering could achieve by chance. Yet the Face and other proposed "structures" on Mars contain no anomalous materials or clearly directed geometry. They resemble natural rock formations found on Earth.  In conclusion, while early low-quality images prompted speculation, scientific evidence has shown the Face on Mars was shaped entirely through normal geological mechanisms over eons without the need for alien intervention. Though disappointing to some, applying rigorous analysis and higher standards of evidence has ruled out artificial origins in favor of readily explained natural processes. As scientists, our conclusions must be guided by facts, not wishful theories lacking supportive data. In this case, further study definitively classified the formation as a result of nature, not design.		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I believe that this change would make our democracy more fair and representative, and it would give all Americans a voice in the election of our highest elected official.  The Electoral College is an outdated system that is no longer necessary. It was created in the 18th century as a compromise between those who wanted the President to be elected by Congress and those who wanted the President to be elected by the people directly. However, the Electoral College has not been necessary since the 19th century, when the number of Representatives in the House of Representatives was capped at 435. This cap has made it impossible for a small state to have a disproportionate number of Electoral College votes, as was the case in the early days of the Republic.  The Electoral College is also unfair. It is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election. This has happened four times in American history, most recently in 2016. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College and became President. This is an unjust and undemocratic outcome, and it is time to abolish the Electoral College so that the person who receives the most votes wins the election.  Some people argue that the Electoral College protects the interests of small states. However, this is not true. The Electoral College actually gives more power to the largest states, because each state has a minimum of three electoral votes regardless of its population. This means that a voter in a small state has more power than a voter in a large state.  I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President by popular vote. This would make our democracy more fair and representative, and it would give all Americans a voice in the election of our highest elected official.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Why do you think teachers should be allowed to design summer projects?  Teachers should be allowed to design projects during the summer for students. My reasons for why teachers should be allowed are that teachers know what they want their assignment to be about. Another is that it can be hard for students to come up with something on their own. Finally Students might forget about and not do it at all.  Teachers who design their projects for students knows how they want the students to do their assignment.  Teachers that design their projects can be easier for students because they will know what to do and how to do it.  Teachers that design the project can me more professional becasue students may make a mistake and not know what they missed and can look to see and fix it.  Students who are busy during the summertime might be harder for them to come up with a projects on their own. They may have jobs that wre very stressful for them to even think about a project. Students can have summer school and might have work from other teachers to complete.  Students having to do assignments on thier own can be bad. Students might not even do thier assignment because it is summer break and wanna have fun with thier friends. Students who might forget about the assignment can be busy during the summer they can be traveling with famliy or even having a job.  Teachers should be allowed to design summer projects for students because its easier for students to get it done faster.		0
In the article "Making Mons Lisa Smile," the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enable computers to identify human emotions. I disagee about using of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.  Technology, such as phones, laptops, or any devices, is not always true. They can predict about how people feel or their emtions. For example, in the second paragraph in the first sentence, it says, "The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face".  Every people have different types of emotions. It's true that they have different kinds of emotions but what if it is fake? Computers are like robots. Computers can't prefer if someone is smiling or upset. Computers don't understand if someone is really smiling for real or faking smiling. It depends on someone's face. For instance, when a friend talk something fun, I smile but when a friend talk something boring, I smile too so they can be happy.  Is putting on a happy face actually work? I prefer not because it depends on someone's emotions inside instead of the outside. Not everybody can read someone's mind. In the last paragraph in the second sentence, it says, "According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them".  It can be true, but it can be false. People don't know what is going to happen next. So people have to figure out on their own. So I disagree that about using of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.		0
Dear Senator Adams, Voting for a president is not what it seems to be. The electoral college makes the people's votes so that the electors are actually voted. These electors vote for the president in favor of their party which is not always trustworthy or reliable. The popularity winner can also lose, due to lack in electoral votes. Many voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In reality, electoral system is outdated and should be tweaked of how it would work today.  To begin with, Electors that are voted for by the people are not always trustworthy. They're hand picked by their political party but sometimes,"state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are..."Does The Electoral. Voters can't control who their electors vote for president. The electoral college should be changed to popularity votes because, "the electors could always defy the will of people"The Indefensible Electoral. This is unreliable and the way of voting by the people can be easily swayed by the electors.  Additionally, the popularity winner can lose by having less electoral votes. Voters can be discouraged to elect their president when really the electors do the job. This situation has happened when,"Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"In Defense Of. Any election, voters can expect another close election in which the popular winner could again lose the presidency. The electoral college is unstable and this major downside is a factor.  More over, many voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In this article it states that, "voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate"The Indefensible Electoral. The electoral college does not clarify to voters on what the people are actually voting for. In another article it explains that people actually voted for a slate of electors. This would mean that the author had to reassure the right understanding. Readers of that article who've voted are now in disbelief or shocked.  In conclusion, the electoral college should be addressed to a win by popularity. The electors in favor of their political party are not always trustworthy. The popularity winner can lose due to lack in electoral votes. Also, many voters are confused or don't know how the electoral college works in presidential elections. These facts add on to more cons than pros of the idea of electoral college.		0
Was there a man on Mars? Magazines say yes, but the scientists have continuously said no. On May 24, 2001, NASA's ship, Viking 1, found something on Mars that had the facial features of a human. Scientists have proven that the piece of rock thought to resemble a human face is no more than just a natural landform through unusual shadows, facts that have been talked about with many scientists, and images taken that agreed with the facts.  First of all, NASA stated that they thought this landform was just another mesa found on Mars. The difference was that this strange, possible mesa obtained humanly facial features. Later, the fact the that the "facial features" on the mesa were due solely to unusual shadows, which gave the untrue image look like eyes, nose, and a mouth.  Next, the fact that the mesa is only a natural landform, not a face has been confirmed with countless scientists. On April 5, 1998, everyone was waiting to see what decision would be released about the mesa. Was it once a face of a person or just another landform on Mars? It appeared on the JPL website that there was no alien monument; it was just a nautral landform. Scientists have confirmed this. The only reason that it is even questioned is because people wanted to have been able to say that there was a face on Mars, even if it was proven otherwise. There is much more publicity for authors especially to say that there was a face on Mars. Unfortunately, scientists know the most in this situation, not authors.  Lastly, scientists took pictures to prove their evidence. In September 1997, Global Surveyor took a photograph of the landform that was ten times better quality than the original Viking picture of the "face". People who are not scientists still disagreed, so NASA and other scientists continued to take images. By the time it was 2001, the mesa did not look like a face anymore. The picture shows that it is clearly just a mesa.  In conclusion, people would be crazy to try to attempt to disagree with the scientists because of how many facts they have to prove their hypotheses. First, they explained why the mesa only looked like a face because of the illusinating shadows. Then, they confirmed it with other scientists. And lastly, the scientists took many photographs of the mesa that finally proved their point. Scientists proved their point by explaining unusual shadows, confirming information with additional scientists, and taking countless photographs of the mesa.		0
Mar's Face  Many people think that Mars has life living on it. One example would be the two mile long landform, the Face. People have been wondering for years what this odd shaped landform is, could it be an alien statue or just a natural landform. The Face is not an alien formation, but a natural landform.  When NASA sent Viking 1, in 1976, to photograph Mars. They took images of the landscape there and stumbled upon a newly forming mesa or butte. Once NASA brought the images back and analyzed them. They found that the Face was nothing more than a Martian mesa with unusual shadows that made it look like a face.  Then, in 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over the region again. They snapped several pictures of it, at a ten times higher resolution, I might add, and analyzed these new images. They finally put their images on the internet and revealed to the world, that the Face was nothing more than a natural landform.  Finally, in 2001, NASA sent Mars Global Surveyor a second time to photograph the Face. The team at NASA used the highest possible resolution to photograph this controversial piece of Mars. They found that the picture shows the, "Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa," which are are also found in the American West. NASA's chief scientist for the Mars Exploration Program says," It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."  Some people think that the Face provides evidence for life on Mars becasue NASA could not get a good shot of it. They do have a point that it would be hard to get a clear image of the Face with challenging weather. Yet, NASA has proven over and over again that the Face is nothing more than a natural formation.  The Face is nothing more than a natural landform and not an alien formation. Scientists found that is was a Martian mesa but the unusual shadows made it look like a face. NASA also found that it was nothing more than a natural landform and the Face looks very similar to buttes or mesas here on earth. Others think that NASA could not have gotten good pictures because of the weather, but NASA has proven that the Face is just a natural landform. The Face is just a strange piece of Mars and not a symbol of alien history.   		0

Everybody's got a car, right? Having a car to many is either required, out of convenience, or even as a status symbol. What if I told you that cars are becoming becoming a burden to the rest of the world. The negative aspects of everybody owning a car have now taken a physical position amongst the world's issues. Not everybody has realized it yet but there are several cities in other countries that are choosing to take on the issues head on. Let me tell you a bit about a couple of them that I have found to have taken the most drastic of steps and by the end of this, I intend for you to have chosen a side to stand with on the issues that lie ahead.  First off, we have VAUBAN, Germany. According to Source 1, the city has made it outright difficult to own a car here. You would be hard-pressed to find anywhere to park as the city has made street parking, driveways, and home garages illegal. You are able to own an automobile but you must go out of your way to drive to a garage at the edge of the district or pay up to $40,000 for a parking space. The city is trying to make its citizens less dependent on automobiles by designing the whole district to be easily accesible through alternative means of transport and by foot. Their example must be getting our attention because the Environmental Protection Agency is also promoting "car reduced" communities. Are we looking at the future of suburban environments?  Next, we have Paris, France. Recently, according to Source 2, the city of France has put a restriction on the amount of cars driving in its streets to reduce their monstrous smog levels. The plan was to have cars with even numbered license plates drive only a particular day and have the cars with odd numbered license plates drive on another day. The plan worked and because of this decision smog levels that leveled near the ones present in Beijing, China which is said to be one of the most polluted in the world have gone down to a reasonable level and they are no longer living in such toxic conditions. Maybe the rest of the world can adopt a similar plan when the need arises.  Lastly, we have Bogota the capital of Columbia. According to Source 3, in Bogota, there is a program in place that banned all motor transportation except for public transit and taxis for a day. In a city of seven milion the need for transportation is pretty high but the citizens who participated managed without a hitch by using other means of tranportation such as by bicycle. This event is part of a long campaign designed to promote smog reduction and alternative means of transport. The campaign has also seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths throughout the city. The city's culture has had no major trouble adapting to the change and places of commerce and recreation have begun to crop up to facilitate the change of pace.  All of this change is beginning to affect our own country as the government is taking notes from the success of these campaigns happening in other countries. According to Source four, studies show that we are seeing a reduction in the ammount of people buying automobiles and earning drivers licences. Is this because of choice or is it because of Americans not having access to enough money to buy new cars? According to the author of this article, Elisabeth Rosenthal, we are seeing the end of the Car Culture. With this thought in mind, which side will you stand with when it is time to decide our future?¬†    		0
 The concept of driverless cars is becoming increasingly popular as technology advances and the number of accidents caused by human error continues to rise. Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, have the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, but there are also concerns about their safety, cost, and impact on the job market.  One of the main advantages of driverless cars is their potential to reduce the number of accidents caused by human error. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), human error causes 94% of all car accidents in the United States. Driverless cars could potentially eliminate these accidents by removing the human element from driving. In addition, driverless cars could help reduce traffic congestion and improve traffic flow, as they would be able to communicate with each other and coordinate their movements.  However, there are also concerns about the safety of driverless cars. While technology has advanced significantly in recent years, there is always the possibility of malfunctions or glitches that could lead to accidents. In addition, there are questions about the ability of driverless cars to handle unexpected situations, such as inclement weather or unexpected road obstacles.  Another concern about driverless cars is their potential cost. While the initial cost of developing autonomous vehicles may be high, there are concerns about the long-term cost of maintaining and operating them. In addition, there are questions about the cost of insurance for driverless cars, as these vehicles could be more expensive to insure due to their complex technology.  Finally, there are concerns about the impact of driverless cars on the job market. While some people may be able to switch to new careers as a result of the rise of autonomous vehicles, others could lose their jobs as machines replace human drivers. This could have significant social and economic consequences, particularly for workers who rely on their jobs for income.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, but there are also concerns about their safety, cost, and impact on the job market. While the technology behind driverless cars is impressive, it will need to be further developed and tested before it becomes widely available. In addition, policymakers will need to address the concerns raised by driverless cars and develop policies to ensure their safe and sustainable adoption.		1
So why do ask other people for their own opinion to help us make the better choice, well by improving your people/talking¬†skills, That most people are usually nervous to talk infrount of others, and how we organize what got from the opinions. Let's to learning these reasons and hopeful teaching you some life skills!  What do to improved our talking/people skills, it's important to get feedback from others and you don't even know when you need it of not. Like here's an example, Generic_Name problem weather she should join the lacrosse team or not and does'nt know what to do. But she gets nervous,¬†so she gets scared asking anyone to help her. So she goes to ask her friends and family weather or not to join. Questions like that are used in everyday life and it's always good to have a second pair of eyes to help you along the way, But it's hard when you are nervous.  How to not be nervous is hard thing to do, Because thing has the mindset were people are judging them every second. When you talk to people about something like Generic_Name she ask different friends and family on problem and still gets nervous around them. When those moments happened you take a deep breathe. Because this what want to say. The people arent going to bite you, they will answer you just like everyone else. Focus what you want to say, no one wants to be stuck in a cage of guilt, because of one questions they never asked. Now I hear that a lot and why I'm telling you this it's because I don't want to see the coward out of anything you are going to strong to go through the future, jobs, relationships, and more.  Now you to ask your friends about your question you need help decided on. When you go the ask something they feel like their opinion valves you a lot to help you with that decision, and might give you more information form other person also could build a stronger relationship. With a lot opinions weather you should join that team, it does give you different perspectives on how different people react to that problem. Others will say yes or no, and might give into details. Now that Generic_Name understands to strong and not scared, she gets her opinions¬†and now ready to sort them out. She uses the simple pros and cons list, and able to find her answers easier then before. Now she checks the list and more votes for her to join the team, and she happy to use her life skill in the future.  Now what did we learn while reading this well, we understood what type of problem Generic_Name had and probloby relate to your problem. we learned that some are scared and nervous to talk to others and that it's important to get over with it, to not cause even more problems in the future. Lastly how can we organize the opinions and how simple it is to do. That why I think it's better to talk to other to more then one person for their opinion. So I hope next time you can remember to use those skills in the real world.		0
As an eighth-grade student, I believe that extending the school day by one and a half hours would bring numerous benefits to both students and teachers. In this essay, I will explore the advantages of a longer school day and argue for its implementation.  Firstly, extending the school day would provide students with more time to learn and engage in academic activities. Currently, many students struggle to keep up with the pace of the curriculum, and a longer school day would give them more time to catch up and get ahead. Additionally, students would have more time to work on projects and assignments, which would improve their overall academic performance.  Secondly, a longer school day would give teachers more time to plan and prepare their lessons, as well as to provide individualized support to students who need it. Teachers would also have more time to assess student progress and adjust their teaching methods accordingly. This would lead to more effective teaching and better student outcomes.  Finally, a longer school day would allow for more extracurricular activities and opportunities for students to engage in community service. This would provide students with valuable life skills and experiences that would benefit them in the future.  In conclusion, extending the school day by one and a half hours would bring numerous benefits to both students and teachers. It would provide students with more time to learn and engage in academic activities, give teachers more time to plan and prepare their lessons, and allow for more extracurricular activities and community service opportunities. I urge school administrators to consider implementing this change to improve the academic and personal development of students.		1
Senator, I believe that voting for the president of the United States should be based off of the popular vote by the people. Not the Electoral College. Voting by the Electoral College does not allow the people to have the final say. It ultimately gives the elector the choice. "The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century" Bradford Plumer, paragraph 14, it was a disaster factor. The electors went against the will of the people and voted the opposite of what they said. Whose to say something like this can't happen again soon?  Some people say that the Electoral College is a good thing. It allows a certainty of outcome and is a fair, reasonable way to vote for a president. But it is based off of trust, that the elector won't betray the candidate's party and people. Trust. Are you really going to put your vote for the president of your country in someone else hand based off of trust?  Having an elector represent your state based off of population is ridiculous. One elector representing 500,000 people in Wyoming. Wouldn't you sleep better at night if you could represent yourself instead of someone representing you and thousands of other people all at once.  In 2000, a candidate had more popular votes, and less electoral votes and lost! Even though the people had more votes! How do you feel knowing that your vote doesn't even count? "Most states have a winnertakeall' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"the Office of the Federal Register,paragraph 7. Because of this system, candidates will not spend time in certain states they know they have no chance in winning in. "During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all"Bradford Plumer, paragraph 13 Next time you go into that voting booth, remember that you're not voting for a president, you're voting and are supposed to trust an elector.		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I am writing this letter to inform you that you should not make every student perform community service. One all students don't have time to stay after school and help out some people have basket ball and football practice I think that we should have a monitor stay around the school and look for the people that litter and make them stay after school.  I think that we the students should choose on if we would like to stay and touter kids For an example some kids don't like other kids and other than tutoring them they could be bulling them we should get older adults to take part in this to prevent thing like this from happening .  Also i think that Community service takes to much time away we need to study and we cant be held up by helping other kids i agree that they need help and i am not against that at all but i think that you should try and help us out and give use a break and only let the students that choose to do community service do it.  After all what i am trying to explain to you that is you should not make every child take part in the community service I hope that you really take my letter into consideration and think about this because from my point of view i think that it is very unfair.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
I do not agree with the principles statement, he should not force other students to do extracurricular activities a lot of students have to much on there plate and are very busy, kids nowadays have to much to worry about school is a very stressful topic for most students because for some of them they either have a failing grade in there classes or to much home work to do that stack up each and everyday and by adding another extra curricular would make it even worse for those stressful students.  One the extra curricular activities could be a special sport but that could be a problem because some parents force their¬†kid to play a sport and half of the time the kid doesnt even like the sport they only do it cause of there parents , the sports can interfere with students learning for an example the student could have so much homework but he has a game that day and there parents are gonna force them to go to practice and or there games and for an other example one of the students can get badly injured and be forced to miss out on school these are just a few of the problems that could happen and it would be better not to take the risk and for the last example the student could love the sport so much he would forget about school or not even care about school , he/she would find school not necessary.  Almost all the extra curricular activities can do can be done during high school you can make the extra curricular activity into an a elective class and can actually make your self even more better at that curricular why does the principal think we need extra curricular s¬†there are some curricular that you have to pay just to participate and i dont see that the curricular s¬†are necessary they are just money and time wasting curricular half of the things you do in the curricular s¬†can be done at home you could teach your self to do those things these are my reasons why i dont think the school principal should be enforcing students to do extra curricular they are just unnecessary , So please next time your principals is trying to enforcing everyone to do extra curricular s¬†tell him these reasons im sure it will change his mind.  time waster could get injured forced to miss out on school money waster makes you forget about school   ¬†¬†		0
Hey people of America do yall agree or disagree with me? I think changing to election by popular vote should chose the president of the united states. Because electoral collage are not always one hundred percent right,also the electoral college dont vote for a president but they vote for a slate of electors,and my last reason is that the electoral college might nominate a bad president for the United States of America.  To start my argument off is that my first reason is that the electoral collage is not always a humdred percent right and we might end up with someone we dont want. for example say if Jhon Snipes is running for president and he has a bad criminal record and he only got twenty percent of the votes and the other canidate had the majority of the vote and Jhon Snipes won. He would probley turn the United Sates into a war zone. See this is the main reason why want someone president and barley no one voted for him os her  Another reason is that the electoral collage dont vote for president they vote for slate of electors. This is bad because slate of electors dont speak for everyone. They might like someone that we dont like and give them the power to run for president and probabley win. so this was another reason why the preseident election shouldnt be picked on the electoral collage.  My last reason is that us the people of the United States of America do not want no scum bag of a president that does nothing what so ever to our country. We want a president that is smart and will take care of tha United State, we want a president that will make us feel safe with the decision that he makes, and finally we want a president that we can believe in and that we trust in.  I gave u all of my reasons why i thunk we shouldent have an electoral collage casting the votes,now its your turn to answer my question do u or do u not agree with my statements about loosing the electoral collage,and if u dont agree with me give me a couple of reasons why u dont.    		0
Well, I think all the students from fifth grade and up should take on the responsibility of doing community service for their school.  I strongly feel that if you are in a good community that you've been in for a while, you should at least take your time and pay the community back somehow. For example, letting the children do recycling for their classrooms, or just staying after school for an hour and helping out with a sports team.  Students will at least take a day out of the week to participate.  If some of the students contemplate about doing their responsibility to the community, let them choose a day out of the week to go and volunteer.  For the other students that don't play any sports or do any other activities, they would have the advantage of volunteering more at the school.  In return to their participation, they could receive at least five extra points added to their lowest test grade of a class which they choose.  No candy or toys will be given, because we would want the children to learn that you can make a difference without getting in return.  With the five extra points, the students will volunteer, more because they wanted to. And the fact the cannot play with the five points, such as, the toys or candy.  I honestly think by doing community service, it will prepare the students for more and harder things ahead of time, or it might just even give them a good feeling inside themselves.  I know when I do my community service, I feel proud out myself for making the world a better place one step at a time. Whether it's doing recycling, or helping a younger child with studying. Each thing has its own benefit and purpose.		0
Driverless cars are defintiely something that not only will make lives much easier, but will also make traveling in a car much safer. The introduction of them is revolutionary, and soon, lawmakers will not have a case to ban them from being used. With these cars, human civilization will be changed forever, for the better. Driverless cars are the future of luxury and safety in automobiles.  First of all, the cars could make lives exponentially easier and more luxurious. With the task of having to drive themselves, people could take driving as a time to relax and think. As stated in the article, there could also be entertainment systems in the cars themselves such as televisions, gaming consoles, and computers. So long as the devices are ot operable anytime the car requires human input, there would be no safety issue involved, and may even serve as a safety feature, alerting drivers of possible imminent danger.  Next, safety in driving would be increased to a near accident-free point. With every car making safe, legal turns, following the government mandated speed limit, and using a GPS to ensure following a safe path, how could any accidents even occur? The only cause of an accident would be a malfunction in the vehicle, which is very rare in even today's cars. Human error would be almost completely eliminated, making today's cars seem like deathtraps compared to driverless ones.  In conclusion, these cars would bring a new level of safety and entertainment to people's lives, maing the highways cleaner and the driver's seat more enjoyable. With driverless cars just ahead in the future, human civilization will be drastically in day-to-day life for the better.          		0
Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assume they continue learning during their break. During summer break most students will not do work unless assigned work to do. Summer projects can help students remember what they learned in school. A summer project can be beneficial to a teacher and to the students. Opponents wrongly believe summer projects should be student designed because students are more likely to do it and can be creative. Although some believe summer projects need to be student designed it should be known, summer projects must be teacher designed.  Summer projects should be teacher designed because of benefits to the teacher. Summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers can plan ahead. For example, Mr. Generic_Name planned a summer project before school started. If Mr. Generic_Name plans ahead then he would not have to worry about it later in the school year. Summer projects should be teacher designed because it is easier for teachers to grade. For instance, Mr. Generic_Name designed the project so he will know what to look for. It will be easier to grade since he designed thew project and made the rubric. Summer projects should be teacher designed because the teacher will not have to worry about the students doing the wrong things. For example, Mr. Generic_Name will not have to worry about the students designing a inappropriate project or not doing the project at all if he does it himself.  Summer projects should be teacher designed because of benefits to students. Summer projects should be teacher designed so students will not have to worry about designing and doing the project. For instance, Generic_Name will not have to design and do the project. Since the teacher is designing the project Generic_Name will not have to worry about that. She can focus on just doing the project. Summer projects should be teacher designed because students know what teachers are looking for. For instance, the students has had many projects before in Mr. Generic_Name's class. Since the teacher is designing the project the students know what he is looking for. Summer projects should be teacher designed so that the students can get the project done faster. For example, Since Mr. Generic_Name already designed the project all Generic_Name has to do is do the project which saves her a lot of time. Doing just the project is faster than having to design it and do the project.  Even though some believe summer projects must be student designed it should be known, summer projects need to be teacher designed. The opposition incorrectly believes summer projects should be student designed because students will learn work ethic and possibly find hidden talents. Summer projects should be teacher designed because of benefits to teachers such as planning ahead, projects being easier to grade, and not having to worry about students doing the wrong things. Additionally, summer projects should be teacher designed because of benefits to students such as not having to worry about designing and doing the project, students already know what the teachers looking for in a project, and getting the project done faster. Summer projects help students remember information. When it is time to go back to school teachers will not have to reteach because the students did a summer project.		0
Virginia is a state full of history and beautiful places to explore on vacation. From the museums that showcase our past to the many parks that offer visitors respite and amazing views, there are many wonderful vacation possibilities. Not only can visitors explore the sites, but they can also take advantage of the educational programs and activities available. Many museums, such as The Museum of the Confederacy and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, offer unique programs for visitors that allow them to learn more about Virginia's history. In addition, there are parks that offer trails for walks, and programs and activities for students to participate in during school breaks. If you are a teacher looking to make the most of vacation time, speak to your local museums and parks about what programs and activities are available and plan a visit today!		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC). The NPVIC is an agreement among states to award all of their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote nationwide. I believe that this compact is the best way to ensure that the president is elected by the majority of Americans, and that it would be a major improvement over the current Electoral College system.  The Electoral College is a system that was designed over 200 years ago, when the United States was a much smaller country. At the time, it was thought that the Electoral College would help to protect the interests of small states by giving them a greater voice in the presidential election. However, the Electoral College has become increasingly undemocratic over time.  In the current system, a candidate can win the presidency even if they lose the popular vote. This happened in 2016, when Donald Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. This is a major problem because it means that the president is not necessarily elected by the majority of Americans.  The NPVIC would fix this problem by ensuring that the president is elected by the majority of Americans. Under the NPVIC, all states would award their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote nationwide. This would make the presidential election more democratic and would ensure that the president represents the interests of all Americans.  I urge you to support the NPVIC. It is the best way to ensure that the president is elected by the majority of Americans and that our democracy is more representative.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Have you ever wondered about space and all of the mysterious things in space? It? a crazy topic with many mystery?. A big idea is that a face has been put on Mars from another life form. It? a rediculous thought with many people such as me shaking their heads at the crazy theroy. There is no way the another life form could put this face on Mars. It? just a cool natural landform that ironicly looks like a face.  Their are many different planets with many different natural landforms on them. Mars just happens to have one of the most interesting natrual landforms however. The face as people call it, is a huge rock formation that gives us an illusion of a face. Humans have claimed that Aliens have put this massive rock formation on there, but from a scientific side their is not a single piece of evidence suggesting that Aliens are real.  Yes, the face is quite mysterious, but their are plenty of queer landforms on every planet. The media is a place that has taken ¬®The Face¬® and it has made it out to seem like Aliens have made it to scare us. I can understand why one who has no sceintific background might believe this, but these landforms can occur any where on any planet over a peroid of time.  As a scientist if you belive something you try and prove it. With the discovery of the face and people skeptic of the aliens scientist? launched a spacecraft into space to see if it could find anything. Nothing. No housing systems, no monuments, no building structures of any sorts, and most importantly no life of any sorts. Mars has harsh living conditions so to find any sort of life would be crazy enough, especially aliens!  The face is just another one of those amazing natural landforms that space has given us. It amazes me and others what things can happen in space. There are for sure no Aliens in space, however. All of the evidence proves to the fact that there is nothing on Mars or in space that could build something. Who knows maybe in a million of years space could amaze us even more with another landform similar to ¬®The Face¬®. I can assure you and the public that ¬®The Face¬® was just another marvelous wonder of a natural landform no evidense of anything like aliens. Space is a crazy wonder that has many things to dicover.		0
 Thomas Jefferson's letter to never be idle is a timeless message that holds true today. One of the issues he addressed was the disrespect that young people often show towards the elderly. While it is important to respect the wisdom and experience of older generations, it is also important to recognize that they are not infallible.  One example of this is in the classroom, where teachers may struggle to keep students engaged and focused on the subject at hand. This can lead to idle behavior and a lack of progress. However, by working together as a community and supporting each other, we can help to overcome these challenges and create a more productive learning environment.  Another issue that Jefferson addressed was the problem of idle people who try to bring others down. This can be seen in many different forms, such as jealousy and a desire to hold others back. However, by focusing on our own progress and working hard towards our goals, we can overcome these obstacles and create a more positive and productive environment for everyone.  In my opinion, it is important for us to work together as a community to address the issue of idle behavior. By supporting each other and working towards common goals, we can create a more positive and productive society for all. Additionally, by recognizing and valuing the different talents and strengths of each individual, we can help to overcome jealousy and create a more inclusive and supportive environment.		1
Dear Principal,  I am writing to express my disagreement with your recent decision to require all students to participate in an extracurricular activity. While I understand the importance of extracurricular activities, I believe that this decision is unjust and unrealistic.  Firstly, not all students have the same interests or abilities. Some students may have physical or mental health issues that prevent them from participating in certain activities. Additionally, some students may have family or financial obligations that make it difficult for them to participate in extracurricular activities. Forcing all students to participate in an activity that they are not interested in or cannot participate in is not fair.  Secondly, extracurricular activities are not always beneficial for all students. Some students may already have a busy schedule with academics, sports, or other commitments. Adding another extracurricular activity to their schedule may cause them to become overwhelmed and stressed. Furthermore, some students may not see the value in participating in an extracurricular activity and may prefer to use their free time for other activities.  Lastly, the school should prioritize academics over extracurricular activities. While extracurricular activities are important, they should not come at the expense of academic performance. Students should be able to choose whether or not they want to participate in an extracurricular activity, but they should not be forced to do so.  In conclusion, I strongly disagree with your decision to require all students to participate in an extracurricular activity. This decision is unfair, unrealistic, and not always beneficial for all students. I urge you to reconsider this decision and allow students to choose whether or not they want to participate in an extracurricular activity.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Distracted Driving: Why Texting and Driving Should be Illegal  Technology has advanced tremendously in the realm of communication, the smartphone is not only a means of communication but an essential tool now for people's careers, entertainment and staying on top of current events. As useful as they are they understandably receive a lot of our attention. A time they should be ignored however is while we are behind the wheel. Texting while driving takes both your hands and eyes away from the road and one is distracted even further while they respond to a notification. The proliferation of the smartphone has led to an unfortunate increase in texting related accidents, especially in teens. Cars are huge dangerous machines that can be fatal tools when handled irresponsibly and a person responding to a text or email is a major distraction that can cause damages to yourself but also the pedestrians and other drivers on the road. These damages are statistically the leading cause of accidents for teens and among the most fatal causes for accidents.  The cars of today have come a long way from the first gas powered automobiles of the late 19th century. When Karl Benz, the Benz in Mercedes-Benz, first drove his newly developed Benz Patent-Motorwagen in 1886 it ran on a single cylinder engine and could reach a maximum speed of 10/mph (Defree). Today, technology has enabled the Koenigsegg Agera RS to reach a top speed of 277.9 mph making it the fastest street- legal production car (Gibson). It's easy to forget just how immense car are when they can take across us cities and seem so compact. Surprisingly, the average weight of a car to be is 1.4 tons or 2,871 pounds. This is from looking at the mid-size models of all the major car companies, with mid-size cars being those falling between compact cars and full size cars and SUVs. The average SUV weighs in at 4,799 pounds which is 40% more than the average car. They don't seem that big when you step inside them. They maybe even feel a bit cramped when you have a lot of passengers. But when the engines starts up and we accelerate to speeds of 60 or even slower road speeds of 40 cars can be very dangerous. In fact any car moving at any speed can be enough to kill a person. At lower speeds the fatality has more to do with the health of the person and manner in which they are hit. Such as elderly person being knocked backwards and hitting their head by a car backing up at only 5 mph. the chances of survival are quite high , decreasing incrementally until about 30 mph. at which they likeliness of death is then at 50 %. The seemingly small increase to 40 mph pushes that number up to 90% (Kill Speed). The physics of a car crash are simple, the energy is transferred from the vehicle to whatever it hits, whether that's another vehicle or a stationary object like a pole or person. A car weighing in at one and a half tons traveling what, to a drivers seems slow, speed of 30 mph is carrying a massive amount of energy. Which when impacted with another person can cause injuries that if the victim were to survive would change their lives forever.  Driving a car even a short distance means you wield a nice amount of power over pedestrians and anything else that doesn't measure up to the your cars size. So it is imperative that when you're behind the wheel of a car the road should have your full attention. In the event that something strays across your path that wasn't meant to you should be alert enough to respond to any sudden roadway dangers and make a decision that will ensure you and those around you are safe. A driver's reaction time is doubled when they are texting and driving. In  Jim Forsyth's article on a small study at Texas A&M University analyzed the impact of texting on an actual road. In the study 42 drivers between ages 16 and 54 drove on an 11-mile (17 km) test course. Once while sending or reading received text messages and then again while their focus was entirely on the road. The researchers also asked participants to brake when they saw a flashing yellow light during both scenarios and recorded their reaction times. Without texting the driver's average reaction time was between 1-2 seconds, but while they were texting it increased to 3-4 seconds. This was regardless of whether the driver was typing or reading a text. The study also found that if a driver was texting they 11 times more likely to miss the flashing light. A few seconds isn't a long time but the difference even one second would make is enormous. On highways where people average anywhere from 70-100 mph cars cross football fields in the same amount of time. Striking a person at this speed would undoubtedly result in their death. But a collision with another is much different much messier and much more hazardous situation altogether. Statistics place distracted driving as being the cause of 20  % of all fatal crashes and cell phones are one of the main distractions.  Texting and driving has very real consequences. In the United States a majority of states have bans on cell phone use while driving. 16 states prohibits the use of hand held devices while driving and 47 states ban texting while driving. No state has a total ban on all cell phones but 38 states and D.C. forbid any cell phone use by teen drivers and beginner drivers (Essex). The legislation is well deserved. As the usage of cellphones has increased so has the number of teens who get injured or, even worse, die as a result of texting while driving (Ricks). Researchers at Cohen Children's Medical Center estimate that there are 3,000 at least teen deaths in America each year from texting and 300,000 injuries. With the number of teens who drink and drive taking a sharp decline in recent years it is now the leading cause of death. Driving under the influence of alcohol results in a projected 2,700 deaths and 282,000 injuries suffered from car crashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From 2013 to 2016 the rate of unintentional accidents led in injury related deaths for teens (Howard). And of those accidents car crashes accounted for 62 %. These are staggering numbers and it's upsetting to know that they could be avoided with safe driving practices. While laws can be passed and enforced they can only do so much. Still their existence proves that texting and driving is very much a growing epidemic that will continue to affect more people than it has today. Should people realize the laws aren't there to simply inconvenience them but to protect them as both drivers and pedestrians perhaps they will become more effective.  When a person gets behind the wheel it is ultimately their decision to practice responsible driving habits. It is hard to imagine that a person who regularly drives would be oblivious to the dangers of texting and driving. Whether is through nationwide data being reported or the coverage of local accidents a person will see the dangers of this bad habit eventually. Hopefully with the passage and enforcement of laws they will be more inclined to put their phones down for a brief moment. If that isn't enough maybe the sobering knowledge of just how powerful their vehicle is would be enough, a car is intimidating figure while it is stationary and while moving it's even more deadly. Such a powerful device should be used responsibly.  Works Cited  Deffree, Suzanne. "Karl Benz Drives the First Automobile, July 3, 1886."

Some schools offer distance learning from there house students can learn from there homes by online classes and by doing video conferencing. i think students cannot get education for 2 to¬†3 hours by sitting home or by talking on video call. if you want to get education you need learning enviornment to learn something. you cannot learn anything by sitting in home some students get tired and sometimes you get lazy by sitting home and doing nothing. if you want to learn someting you have to be present in class physically and mentaly in order to learn something.  they should use these options when there is bad weather or ice roads outside so that studdents do not miss there education due to the bad weather students can keep up with there classes and with there grades.  i don't agree on talking online claases for whole year while sitting home sometimes you do not know how to solve problems while sitting homw some students do not have a wifi facility at there homes how they are suppose to take classes on online if they do not have laptop or wifi at there house. all the students should come to the school if they want to get education in order to get there diploma. students who do not have any source of coming to school but they do have laptops it can help them to get there diploma while sitting home.  students who got injuries and cannot come to school for 1 month because there doctor gave him or her bed rest for 1 month this option can help him so that he or she do not miss there whole month so that they can keep up with there grades so that he or she do not fall back and they can get there diploma.  some students who work 5 to 6 days in a week and cannot get up early in the morning this program can help them to get there diploma by staying and taking there test online and video conferencing with there teacher. i do not think all schools should start this program we all have to use techonolgy but you cannot learn whole year while sitting home and doing video call you have to be in learning environment to learn someting because when you get to the collage things are tottaly different no one gonna help you if you do not want to learn all the students have to do everthing by there self.		0
A project during the summer, is a students worst nightmare. Certain schools do this to insure that their students are still learning during the vacation. If students designed this projects over the summer,not only will they have fun while learning, have all the creativity in the world, they will be willing to complete the tasks and more students will do the assignment.  During the summer, students participate in a variety of events. Students go camping, travel to different places, and much more. All these activities that they are involved in could lead to very interesting projects. Students could write about visiting the Eiffel Tower or an essay on how to catch a fish. All these creative ideas can come out of letting students designed their own projects.  As kids students were thought the alphabet and their numbers through joyful and exciting ways. Whether it was watching Sesame Street and learning how to count or learning songs about the alphabet, learning was made in a way that they were expanding their knowledge with out evening being aware. Allowing students creative freedom on the project will led to these same results. The student will be expand their knowledge while having fun at the same time.  However, none of this matters if the student is not going to do the project. Summer vacation is viewed as a break off of school so students often will not do work. Providing students with the authority to create their own project insures the probability of them completing the task. Students tend to engage in activity that interest them, so allowing them to do so will make it more likely for the assignment to be completed.  Furthermore, if the schools are going to make students do a summer project, they should allow the student to decide what they want to do. This will lead to more students completing the task, creative ideas which each assignment handed in and the students will be expanding their knowledge while being excited to learn.¬†¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
 The passage set presents several examples of communities that have implemented measures to limit car usage. These communities have been successful in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. In this essay, I will argue that limiting car usage has several advantages, including reduced traffic congestion, improved public health, and increased economic opportunities.  Firstly, limiting car usage can significantly reduce traffic congestion. In the case of Vauban, Germany, the streets are completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare and a few streets on the edge of the community. This has resulted in a decrease in traffic congestion and has made it easier for residents to walk, bike, or use public transportation. Similarly, in Paris, France, a partial driving ban was implemented to clear the air of smog, resulting in a 60% decrease in congestion.  Secondly, limiting car usage can have significant positive impacts on public health. In the case of Vauban, the decrease in traffic congestion has resulted in a decrease in air pollution, which has improved the health of residents. Additionally, the increase in walking and biking has resulted in a decrease in obesity and an increase in physical activity, which can lead to a decrease in chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.  Thirdly, limiting car usage can create economic opportunities. In the case of Vauban, the decrease in car ownership has resulted in a decrease in parking fees, which has made it more affordable for residents to live in the community. Additionally, the increase in walking and biking has resulted in the creation of new businesses, such as bike shops and cafes, which have created jobs and stimulated the local economy.  However, there are some potential counterclaims to limiting car usage. One potential counterclaim is that limiting car usage can be inconvenient for residents who need to travel long distances or who have disabilities. However, this can be mitigated by providing alternative modes of transportation, such as public transportation or bike-sharing programs. Additionally, some residents may be resistant to change, and limiting car usage may require significant investment in infrastructure and education to encourage residents to adopt new modes of transportation.  In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages, including reduced traffic congestion, improved public health, and increased economic opportunities. While there may be some potential counterclaims, the benefits of limiting car usage outweigh the costs. Communities that have implemented measures to limit car usage, such as Vauban and Paris, have seen significant improvements in their quality of life and their environment. As such, it is important for policymakers and community leaders to consider implementing similar measures in their own communities.		1
Summer Projects  Summer break is a students favorite time of year. It is a vacation from school, five days a week, for three months. The only exception to this is a summer project. Teachers assign summer projects to their upcoming classes, so when school starts again they have not forgotten everything they previously learned and are prepared for what the new school year has in store. Although some people can argue that students should be given options for their summer assignments, it is best to leave that job to the professionals because they are the ones trying to refresh, prepare, and teach students. Even if the teacher does pick the topic, that does not mean students cannot be creative and think outside the box.  If students got to pick their own topics, maybe they would feel inspired and put in more effort, but it is more likely that they would do something easy they already know about. The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. For example, if your teacher asked you to read any book and write a report on it, it would be easy to pick a book you have already read or even Google a summary of a random book, but if your teacher picked the book, then you would read a book you probably have not read and actually learn something new.¬†Copying down what you find online or using a book you read two years ago will not help you grow academically or refresh your mind.  The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. Since teachers already know the curriculum, before the year even starts, a simple summer project is perfect to keep their brain active while familiarizing them with new material. Even just writing a short poem inspired by the Romanticism Era with an analysis is a good way to introduce a subject they might not know a lot about. Summer projects do not have to be hard or long, just enough to give a preview of what they will be learning. A specific topic also allows a more detailed rubric because it tells you exactly what to do, whereas if everyone picked, the rubric would not be specific or very helpful.  Teachers can pick the topic of a summer assignment without taking the individuality out. If the teacher picks a topic, it is obviously something they know about already. Teachers picking the assignment also reduces confusion and encourages student collaboration to talk to each other about the task to better understand. Any project you get regardless of it being during the summer or the school is meant to prepare you for the future. High school is all about preparing you, whether that is something as small as starting a new school year to going to college.  Every single thing you do in life can teach you something. That is why teachers are so important because they get paid to teach students, like me. Even if it seems pointless, it is important to still do it because in the end, just completing the task shows perseverance¬†and teaches students not to procrastinate. Nobody would hand out projects for fun. All assignments are to benefit their students in the long run. It is also important to try to have fun while doing school work because if your mind is open to new things, you might like what you are learning. Getting assigned a topic is not meant to put you in a box, it is meant to give a topic to explore.  We should leave the teaching to the teachers. Let them decide the best way to teach us because that is what they are here for. If they want us to really understand their lessons, they should pick the assignments to ensure they get the results they desire. Teachers went to school to learn the best methods of teaching, so we should trust them to refresh, prepare, and teach students everything they need to know.		0
Studying venus is a amazing purduit because no human could not live in venus or go up to venus because its far away from earth and we haven't made a spaceship that could reach all the way up in venus because it could never make it. Another stuff you can be finding for venus is the clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus. And on the planet;s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure in 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.  These facts that you can research are very true because you could go up there and find out all theses stuff and these facts support my claim because you can research cool stuff about Venus and that other people didn't know about and thats how it supports my claim.  And thisw concludes all the stuff in my essay if Venus is a worthy pursuit to study about Yes i think it is because you could be learning more than others about Venus.		0
I crossed the Atlantic Ocean over ten times. I crossed the Pacific twice to help people who were struggling from World War II. The article "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves" writtten by Peggy Reif Miller was not only a story for encouraging people who are down and need to do something, but it also gives the main charcter's point of veiw too. Miller tells us how daring the adventure can be over seas, but what I tell is totally different. When I was over seas I saw many beautiful things. Miller may thought it was scary, but I assure you it is not.  When I was out of high-school I was working two jobs. I worked at a grocery store and at a bank. Then my friend Don Reist gave me a call asking if I wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It was an opportunity of a life time. I said yes. It was 1945 and as you know World War II was going on. In August 1945, I received orders to report to New Orleans. We arrived the 14 of August, the day the Pacific War ended. I turned 18 before arriving in Greece. I could become apart of the army. The board saw I was apart of the cattle-boat trip. So they told me to stay on it. I was fine with it. By the time I discharged in 1947, I made nine trips. The most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Maybe one day you could become the Seagoing Cowboy to make the most trips. Maybe you could become apart of the army. If you become apart of the Seagoing Cowboy you can accomplish many things. I told you it's not scary. Your making exhilerating things happen.  The cattle-boats were an unbelievable opportunity for me. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis was very special though. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. It was extrordinary! I was done with the tours and we were crossing the Atlantic from the easten coast to the United States of America. I was on duty of cleaning stalls and feeding the animals. I was watch man for one night. I was making my report to captain when I slipped on the ladder. I most fell into sea, but I recovered. I had a few cracked ribs, but I was fine. I had time to have fun on board. I played many games with my friends. Some games we played were volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. A Seagoing Cowboy kind of sounds fun now doesn't it. You could have so much fun with your friends and other new people. You can have fun with the animals. The big part of being a Seagoing Cowboys is getting to say this, "I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs." This awareness stayed with me.  So you got the point of veiw from other people like Miller and people who don't like the army, but now you got my point of veiw. People think it's scary or dangerous. Yes, it's dangerous, but fun. Not only do you get to help people, but you get to see amazing veiws and you get to encourage other people to do great things. I've crossed the Atlantic Ocean over ten times, I've crossed the Pacific twice. Can you do the same or something even better?		0
There are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage helps to cleanse the environment, saves citizens money, and can help with improving citizens health.  One advantage to limiting car usage is that it will cleanse the environment. Cars give off a number of gallons of gas each time they're used. These toxic chemicals found in gases pollute the air. Imagine breathing in all of that waste! Studies have actually found evidence that the toxins from car fuel are very harmful to the health of animals, plants, and humans. It can cause breathing difficulties associated with problems in the lungs when inhaled too heavily as well as it dirties plants and makes it more difficult for them to grow healthy, like they should, and it can even poison and kill the animals. Who wants to take a risk so deadly?  Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it will save citizens money. Cars aren't cheap. Depending on the make and model of the car, they can cost anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000. Insurance and keeping up with the maintenance of a car also costs a lot. Car owners should be expecting to pay 100500 a month for car maintence, and if insurance is required, depending on the state that the car owner lives in, than another additional 100. Finally, is the price for gas. The price for gas in this day in age economy ranges from 3.006.00 per gallon! If a car owner has a long way to drive, but doesn't have a lot of money, heshe may want to consider taking a bus or carpooling with someone to help them out.  A rather more humorous advantage to limiting car usage, is that it could help give citizens a work out. Instead of driving where they need to go, people could walk to their desired destination and burn a ton of calories while doing it! Or in contrast to waiting for a friend to pick them up outside their houses, they could walk to a bus stop and wait for the bus to take them wherever they need to go. This also relates to saving money and helping cleanse the environment. Citizens' will pay less for a gym membership now that they're getting a work out. They'll also be helping the environment by not burning all of those fuel wastes just to get to where they need to go. It's a winwin for everyone!  Of course, there are many advantages to limiting car usage for our citizens, their wallets, and the environment. These three are just a few of the plentiful, conservative ways out there however, they're all extroardinarily efficient.		0
The Facial Action Coding System is a new software that developes the improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The system has six basic emotions-happiness, surpise, anger, disgust fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characeteristic movements of the facial muscles. The software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared againest a neutral face (showing no emotion. How does it work? The process begines when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.  The argument talks about if the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable or not. The technology will idnetify what the students behavior is like. If a student doesn't want to show what they are feeling, the technology will solve it out. Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.  I think this technology is not valuable in a student's classroom. The student's emotional expressions will be easy to find out what they are feeling because it's in person. Mona Lisa painting needed the technolgy because no one knows what she is feeling like. This technology will be good use for paintings, pictures, etc, that it can't be expressed. The technology should only be used for educational purposes, not to find out what the student is feeling in daily. It is easy to see a genunie smile and a fake one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. 		0
 Introduction:  The face on Mars is an object of mystery and intrigue for many people, especially those interested in extraterrestrial life. One theory suggests that the face was created by aliens. Although this notion is exciting, it is not based on scientific evidence. In fact, the overwhelming consensus among scientists is that the face is just a natural landform. This essay will present an argument that the face on Mars is a natural landform based on claims and evidence from the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars.'  Body:  Claim 1: The landmark is geologically active.  One claim that supports the idea that the face on Mars is a natural landform is that it is geologically active. According to the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars,' the landmark is one of the youngest landforms on Mars and has continued to change over time. This suggests that the face is a result of geological processes, such as erosion or volcanic activity.  Claim 2: The landmark is composed of a common type of rock on Mars.  Another claim that supports the idea that the face on Mars is a natural landform is that it is composed of a common type of rock on Mars. According to the article, the landmark is made of a type of volcanic rock called basalt. This indicates that the face is more likely to be a result of natural geological processes than extraterrestrial intervention.  Claim 3: The landmark is similar to other geological features on Mars.  Finally, the last claim that supports the idea that the face on Mars is a natural landform is that it is similar to other geological features on Mars. The article notes that the landmark is similar in shape and size to other volcanic formations on Mars. This supports the idea that the face is more likely to be a result of natural geological processes.  Conclusion:  In conclusion, the evidence presented in the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' strongly suggests that the landmark is a natural landform. The landmark is geologically active, composed of a common type of rock on Mars, and similar to other geological features on Mars. These claims support the idea that the face on Mars was created by natural geological processes, rather than extraterrestrial intervention. Therefore, we should continue to investigate the face on Mars with scientific curiosity and caution, rather than accepting the possibility of extraterrestrial intervention without evidence.		1
 Car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular as people focus on reducing their carbon footprint and improving their quality of life. The idea of car-free cities is simple: instead of driving their cars, people use other forms of transportation such as walking, biking, public transit, and even scooters. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of car-free cities and why they are becoming more popular.  One of the main benefits of car-free cities is the reduction of air pollution. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and by removing them from cities, air pollution can be greatly reduced. In addition to this, car-free cities create a healthier environment by encouraging physical activity, which can lead to a reduction in obesity and other health problems.  Car-free cities are also safer. When cars are removed from the streets, there are fewer accidents and injuries. This is because there are fewer cars moving around, and drivers are less distracted by their phones or other electronic devices. In addition, sidewalks and bike lanes are more separated from traffic, making it safer to walk or cycle around the city.  Another benefit of car-free cities is that they are more livable. When cars are removed from the streets, cities become more pedestrian-friendly, with wider sidewalks, more public spaces, and reduced noise levels. This can lead to a more enjoyable and vibrant community life.  Car-free cities also save money. Car ownership can be expensive, as people often spend money on gas, maintenance, insurance, and car parking. By removing cars from cities, people can save money on these expenses and use that money for other things. In addition, car-free cities see less gridlock, which means that people can get around more easily and quickly, saving time and reducing transportation costs.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a range of benefits, including reduced air pollution, improved health, increased safety, more livable communities, and cost savings. As people continue to focus on reducing their carbon footprint and improving their quality of life, car-free cities are likely to become more popular. Whether or not car-free cities will become the norm in the future remains to be seen, but it is clear that they offer a better way of life for everyone involved.		1
Dear state senator, to the people voting is the most important part of politics. You out of all people speak politics, so you should understand. Keeping the electoral college would be many more great successful years in voting because of the certainty of outcome, it would take care of the swing and big states, and it avoids runoff elections.  Disputes over the outcomes of an electoral vote is possible. The winning candidate's share of the electoral college exceeds the popular vote. In other words in 2012 Obama received 61.7 percent of the votes while rodney received only 51.3, and because almost all of the states award winnertakesall even a slight chance of popularity could change the results. It is very unlikely for this to happen. Although there are many things wrong with the electoral college like making peoples votes not exactly count, it is something to figure out.  For the swing and big states, the voting is slightly different. The voters in the tossup states tend to pay more attention to the campaign than any other place. They really get into the whole campaign and really listen to all of what the competing candidates say and do. For the big states, the electoral college does them a favor and gives them more electoral candidates. It restores the weight in the balance that large states lose by virtue.  The electoral college does us a big favor by avoiding runoff situations, that could lead tomoe complicated situations. The runoff election occurs when no candidate recieves a majority of the votes casted. These runoff elections cause a lot of pressure, and surely does complicate the presidential election.  In conclusion, staying with the electoral college process, it would maintain our problems of eunoff elections, certainty of the outcome and the big and swing issues.		0
Homework is an important part of every student's life. It helps them to learn new concepts, practice skills, and develop discipline. However, not all students have the same level of understanding or motivation when it comes to homework. This is where an after-school homework club can be beneficial.  One potential benefit of starting an after-school homework club is that it can provide a supportive environment for students who struggle with homework. By working together, students can help each other understand difficult concepts and provide feedback on their work. This can lead to improved grades and a greater sense of confidence in their academic abilities.  Another benefit of an after-school homework club is that it can help students to develop time management skills. With the club, students can work on their homework in a structured environment, with set time limits for each task. This can help them to prioritize their work and develop the discipline needed to complete their assignments on time.  Finally, an after-school homework club can provide a social outlet for students. By working together on homework, students can develop friendships and social skills. This can be particularly beneficial for students who may feel isolated or left out in their regular classroom environment.  To support the opening of an after-school homework club, there are several additional reasons to consider. First, the club can provide a safe and supportive environment for students who may be struggling with academic challenges. This can be particularly important for students who are dealing with stress or anxiety related to their schoolwork.  Second, the club can provide an opportunity for students to work on their homework in a collaborative environment. By working together, students can learn from each other and develop their critical thinking skills. This can lead to improved grades and a greater sense of academic achievement.

While it is important for students to socialize with their peers at school, it can also be a beneficial option for students to experience education elsewhere, whether that be online or at an alternate site. Reasons such as affects of weather, familiarity with technology, and a more flexible schedule show that it could be helpful for students in the long run to experience more than just the day-to-day classroom.  In places around the United States, it can be a problem for many students to get to school safely when inclement weather strikes the area. For these students, they can be out of school for days in the winter, which has a negative impact on their grades. It is difficult to learn and understand material when the students are only attending class intermittently. If students took online classes, this issue would resolve itself. Online classes offer a new opportunity that would involve students not leaving their houses. This promotes a better education and safety as they will not have to venture out into the bad weather. Video classes from home are essentially safer and better for the student's overall academic well being.  It is a known fact that this world is constantly changing and evolving into a more technology-based environment. While students already excel at a majority of technologies, it is unlikely that they have any extensive experience in online classes, seeing as most have spent their prior educational years in a classroom. With the help of online classes, students can familiarize themselves with the specific technology used for education. This could be beneficial for them in the future as well. The field of technology is constantly expanding which means the demand for specialists in this field in increasing. By students using this technology while they are young, they can gain the experience and, if they so choose, can enter into the field of technology with an advantage over the competition.  The normal school day has a very structured schedule. Students have to be there by a specified time, wait until an exact moment to leave any class, and even have to eat at a scheduled time. While structure and schedule are essential in an adolescents life, it is also important for them to gain the real world experience. In this new and growing world, regimented schedules, like the schools, are not seen as much, which can surprise students who are unprepared. Online classes give the perfect opportunity for students to gain the experience of a more flexible schedule. I personally took an online class, and it was very useful in showing me what a more practical day looks like. One of the biggest differences I noticed was that when I was done my work, I didn't have to stay on the website any longer, unless I wanted to get ahead. In other words, I could work at my own pace, which is very beneficial to all students, whether they work quickly or need a little extra time to complete an assignment. Online classes give students the opportunity to be flexible while still receiving the real world experience.  Overall, online classes are very beneficial to students and they give many new opportunities and experiences that would otherwise be out of reach. Some of theses opportunities include ways of learning around the obstacle of weather, technological experience, and a flexible schedule. Online classes have the potential to help advance and revolutionize the school system that would bring the United States into a new era of education.¬†		0
Students should or should or should not do at least one extracrrcular activity? Students should, because sports help with physical strength, and help you stay in shape. If you are doing community services your helping do better thing for your communtiy before its too late.  The first reason is, sports help with physical strength because, in most sports you have to run such as volleyball, football, track, basketball, etc. With running you have to gain muscule so when you run your legs wont be tired or worn out. Also its not just running and using your legs if you are a lineman in football you have to use most of your uper body to push people away.  The second reason is, with sports you come being in shape, with all running and and jummping and moving around, you become more in shape and cordinated. The population is getting more unfit as we know it. People are going on there phones and that's all they do they dont excursice. Some children are overweight, by doing a sport they could because more in shape.  The final reason is, even if some students don't do sports, they could do community service. Were they embetter the earth, by cleaning up beaches, getting trash out of the ocean, and by coming up with ways to make the world a better place for humans and animals. Earth we know is over pollutated with evrbody's trash students should try to help the earth get better.  In concluion, students should preticapate in a extracrrualar activity. With the sports also helps kids get more in shape and gets ther pysical stregth up. Also as we know our population is getting more obeis with sports we can provent that.  Altogether with everything thats going on we should help the earth get back into its healthy state by do community services too.		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing to express my opinion about whether the United States should retain the Electoral College process or move towards a popular vote system to elect the president. Having immersed myself in multiple perspectives and arguments from different sources, I maintain that the Electoral College, despite its perceived faults, remains a crucial component of our political system and should be retained.  First and foremost, the Electoral College preserves the balance of power among states with different population sizes. As noted in the Office of the Federal Register's document, each state gets a number of electors proportional to their representation in Congress (What Is the Electoral College?). This assures that small states are not neglected and have their interests represented in the presidential election. In contrast, a popular vote system could result in candidates focusing primarily on densely populated areas, disregarding the diverse needs of smaller or rural states.   Furthermore, Judge Richard A. Posner defends the Electoral College by emphasizing its contribution towards political stability in this country (In Defense of the Electoral College). He explains how the Electoral College demands that a presidential candidate has a broad appeal across numerous regions rather than focusing on sectional interests. This virtually ensures that the elected president represents a larger spectrum of the American populace, thereby adding to their legitimacy as the nation's leader.  Despite these arguments, valid concerns do exist about the current Electoral College system, as explored by Bradford Plumer (The Indefensible Electoral College). His remarks on potential election crises, such as electors not reflecting the people's will, or the possibility of an electoral tie, are significant. Yet, it's important to note that these scenarios are extraordinarily rare and have mechanisms in place for resolution. Moreover, the potential for distortions and dispute is not eliminated in a direct popular vote system  ?it might instead shift the battleground from state legislatures to individual precincts.  Regarding Plumer's concern that the current system unfairly forces candidates to focus on swing states, neglecting noncompetitive ones, Posner provides a compelling counter-argument (In Defense of the Electoral College). He explains that voters in these swing states, aware of their pivotal role, are more likely to scrutinize the candidates and their policies, fostering a more informed electorate  ?a foundation stone of any democracy.  In conclusion, while the Electoral College system is not perfect and may seem undemocratic when compared to a straightforward popular vote, it has provided us with political stability and encourages candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Instead of abolishing it, I propose we analyze individual issues such as faithless electors or the winner-take-all system and initiate reforms to address these specific complaints.   Thank you for considering my perspective.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1

Dear principal,  I believe people disserve to pick why any and why not they want to do community services. I say that if you love the earth then go a head and pick up litter. If you like to watch children then do it and have fun. If you to darn lazy to help the earth or people that are younger then you then be that way its your choice . But principle its not fair that you are trying to make every one do it community service is basically for cops when you are bad and you don't want to go to jail you have to do community service. Were not bad people we didn't do any thing rung so you cant tell us we do or we don't gatta do community service. It is a privilege for some people and it is torture for others and i know you are the boss of the school and every thing but we are students and we disserve to pick if we do or don't it is a school choices not a have to thing and if you want you could make it an after school activity for people who want to do it. I have friends who love to do it and i have friends who hate it. Its there choice i don't really care there still my friends and there your students so please think about it thank you.

The Face on Mars is a mystery of how it was created. Know one knows how it was made, if it was created by aliens or just a natural landform. People may think that since it is in space it has to do with aliens in some possible way. Scientist Jim Garvin discovered a landform similar to the Face on Mars. The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the shape of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. They also have discovered that the surveyor has labeled it a natural landform. The Face on Mars is catergorized as a mesa which is around the American West. Could the Face on Mars be a natural landform?  The similar land form in Idaho has the same height as the Face on Mars. The pictures that they have captured shows the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. If this was a alien type of act the MGS would have seen the alien's shelters, airplanes, and pyramids. The Face on Mars is not a alien' s sculpture. NASA's surveyor had labeled the face as a natural landform. The surveyor catergorized it as a natural landform because it didn't pick up any traces of alien activity. Also, if NASA wasn't forsure about their discovery they woudn't have posted it on websites or annonced it to the world. They said that they would have rathered kept this information classified. Why would you put a false statement on the internet, expecially if it involved aliens, because then the world would be going crazy. They would be preparing for them to attack and abduct people.  I could understand why some people could believe that aliens made up this rock like object. One of the most obvious reasons is that it is space. On the day when they wanted to take another picture it was very cloudy and you couldn't see the face, which some believe that aliens had hid the face by a haze. But, we haven't had any discoveries or theroies of there being aliens in this galaxy.  In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a natural landform that was not created by aliens.              		0
The Development of Driverless Vehicles  While driverless cars certainly offer significant benefits, they also present serious risks that call into question whether society should embrace this new technology. The article "Driverless Cars are Coming" outlines both sides of this debate, raising valid points that deserve consideration.   Supporters argue that driverless cars could help reduce accidents caused by human error, the largest single cause of traffic fatalities today. Without the imperfect human element behind the wheel, these autonomous vehicles may one day navigate streets and highways far more safely than people can. Proponents also point to increased mobility for those unable to drive themselves, such as the elderly or disabled. By taking the driver out of the vehicle, new levels of independence could be achieved.  However, opponents note several drawbacks and uncertainties. Technology can and does malfunction, as even the most advanced systems are ultimately designed by imperfect humans. While certainly an improvement over distracted or impaired human drivers, driverless cars still present new risks. The software that would operate millions of vehicles simultaneously could potentially be hacked or exploited in unforeseen ways. There are also open questions about how autonomous vehicles would handle unpredictable situations that today's AI has not yet mastered. Until such issues are fully addressed, an overly hasty adoption of driverless technology risks serious unintended consequences.  Ultimately, both sides of this debate raise convincing concerns. While autonomous vehicles show great promise in theory, we have not yet reached a point where their safety and security can be guaranteed in all real world conditions. More research and testing are still needed to ensure driverless cars live up to their promise without compromising public safety or introducing new harms. A cautious, step-by-step approach to development and implementation seems wisest until both technology and regulations are adequately prepared to responsibly manage this transformation. On the issue of driverless cars, prudence should outweigh promises‚Äîat least for now.		1
 My mom always tells me "never give up, keep going until you reach your goals."  I believe that if we are constantly striving for something, we can achieve more than we ever thought possible.  Firstly, it is essential to persevere through challenges, even when progress seems slow or impossible. For instance, when I started high school, I struggled with algebra. I would enter the classroom each day and spend the first few minutes trying to solve the warm-up problems. Despite my initial struggles, I continued to work on my skills and sought help from my teacher and classmates. With their guidance, I was able to understand the concepts and improve my grades. If I had given up and accepted my limitations, I would never have seen the progress I made.  Secondly, it is crucial to push yourself beyond your comfort zone and never stop striving for more. For example, my boss at a fast-food restaurant started as a cashier. Many of my coworkers told her that it would be challenging to move up the ranks, but she refused to listen. Instead, she worked hard and proved them wrong by becoming a manager. If you truly want to achieve something, you must be willing to put in the effort and never settle for mediocrity.  Lastly, some people may argue that repeating the same action over and over again will never lead to success, but many examples prove otherwise. For instance, in a TV show about a girl who failed to get into college multiple times, but she never gave up. Her persistence and determination eventually paid off when she was accepted into a prestigious university. By constantly striving and never giving up, we can achieve our goals and dreams.  In conclusion, to achieve success, one must never stop working towards their goals. The world is full of opportunities, but only those who are willing to put in the effort and never give up can take advantage of them. My mom's words have always been a source of motivation for me, and I strive to live by them every day.		1

 Venus, often referred to as the "Queen of the Planets," is the second planet from the sun and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. It is a fascinating world that has captured the imagination of scientists and explorers alike for decades. In recent years, new technologies have allowed for a deeper understanding of Venus and its many mysteries.  One of the most intriguing features of Venus is its extreme hot and humid climate. With surface temperatures that can reach up to 460-degrees Celsius and pressures that are 90 times greater than earth's, it is a harsh and inhospitable environment. However, recent studies have revealed that Venus may not always have been this way. Scientists believe that the planet's thick atmosphere and greenhouse effect may have been responsible for trapping heat, causing the planet to warm up and become more hospitable to life.  Another intriguing aspect of Venus is its similarities to Earth. Both planets have a similar size and composition, with Venus being slightly larger than Earth. In addition, both planets have a rotational period that is similar to Earth's. This has led scientists to speculate that Venus may have once had life, or at the very least, the conditions that could have supported life.  Despite the challenges posed by Venus' extreme climate, scientists have made some remarkable discoveries on the planet. For example, in 2004, scientists discovered evidence of water in the form of lava flows on the planet's surface. This has led researchers to believe that there may be some form of liquid water on Venus, either on the surface or beneath the thick atmosphere.  Exploring Venus is a fascinating and challenging task for scientists. With our current technology, it is still difficult to study the planet directly. However, with new technologies on the horizon, such as space elevators and reusable spacecraft, it may become easier to explore this mysterious and fascinating planet.  In conclusion, Venus is a world of mystery and intrigue. From its extreme climate to its similarities to Earth, there is still much to learn about this fascinating planet. As we continue to advance our knowledge and technology, it is sure that our understanding of Venus will continue to grow, and who knows, we may even discover life on this remarkable planet.		1

It is imagination that allows us to envision a brighter tomorrow.  Imagination is the ability to see beyond the present and create something new. It is the power to dream, to innovate, and to create. When we use our imagination, we can see possibilities that we may not have considered before. We can imagine new technologies, new ways of living, and new ways of solving problems. By using our imagination, we can create a better future for ourselves and for the world around us.  Furthermore, imagination is a powerful tool for overcoming obstacles. When we face challenges, we can use our imagination to find new solutions. We can imagine new ways of approaching a problem, new ways of thinking about a situation, and new ways of seeing the world. By using our imagination, we can overcome any obstacle and create a better future.  In conclusion, while knowledge is important for understanding the world around us, imagination is essential for creating a better future. It allows us to see beyond the present and create something new, to dream, to innovate, and to create. By using our imagination, we can overcome any obstacle and create a brighter tomorrow.		1
 Driverless cars are becoming increasingly popular among technologically savvy individuals who want to eliminate the hassle of driving, reduce accidents, and improve traffic efficiency. The article   Driverless Cars are Coming   presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars, but according to me, the benefits of these vehicles outweigh the drawbacks.   One of the main advantages of driverless cars is the potential to reduce accidents caused by human errors. According to the article, drivers cause over 90% of all accidents on the road. This is largely due to the fact that people get distracted, impaired, or drowsy behind the wheel. With driverless cars, these factors would no longer be an issue, as the vehicles would be essentially autonomous, relying heavily on sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to navigate the roads safely.   Another advantage of driverless cars is the possibility to improve traffic flow. The article points out that these vehicles are programmed to communicate with each other, which would allow for smoother and more efficient transit. This could result in less congestion and shorter commute times, ultimately improving the quality of life for people in urban areas.   Despite these benefits, the article also presents several concerns regarding the development of driverless cars. One of the main issues is the cost of these vehicles, which is currently quite high. However, as technology advances and production becomes more widespread, I believe that the cost of these vehicles will decrease significantly, making them more accessible to the general public.   Another concern raised in the article is the impact of driverless cars on employment. While the article notes that autonomous vehicles will require fewer drivers, there will also be a need for skilled individuals to maintain and manage these vehicles. This could create new job opportunities in the fields of computer science, technology, and engineering.   In conclusion, while there are certainly concerns about the development of driverless cars, I believe that these vehicles offer many potential benefits that make them worth pursuing. The potential to reduce accidents, improve traffic flow, and provide more efficient transit make these vehicles a promising solution to some of the biggest challenges faced by our transportation systems today. With continued innovation and investment in these technologies, I am convinced that driverless cars will become an integral part of our daily lives in the not-too-distant future.		1
Phones and Driving  Today, the majority of people own and operate their phones while driving their vehicles which will always be a no go. That's very dangerous and now it is illegal to do so, if you are caught texting and driving or even talking on the phone while you are driving you will get pulled over and maybe sent to jail.  I feel like the only time you should talk on the phone and drive is if its an emergency with your kids, mom, husband, or dad. You probably shouldn't then but i know i would because i would want to know what's going on with either of them.  Texting and driving causes many wrecks, and kills hundreds of people each year. And it's all over a simple little text you could have read after you got to a stopping point or could have even waited until you got home. I risk my life every day just like any other person just by texting and driving and the text dont even be that important but to me it is. Over 50% of crashes are because of people who text and drive. When you are engaged in a conversation from calling or even texting your attention is divided causing you to hit something or someone and who's to say you will make it out of that?  There are so many ways texting and driving can be permitted, even if you have to leave your phone at home just to run to walmart do it!! Because no phone is worth losing your life over i promise it's more to that. A simple "ok" text could lead into you getting in a wreck being left in critical condition with doctors telling your family "you might not make it" do you want that to happen? Think about texting and driving before you do it, it's never the answer it can wait.         		0
Dear principal,  I think hat student should b allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as the phones are turned off during class time and im going to tell u why.  statistics shows that five out of every ten students have emergencies in school and might b embarrassed to tell any one about it and if they where allowed to use there phones during that free time they could call a parent or a close friend to come help out with the situation. Now i think that's better than having the whole entire school knowing about your business. Another reason is that a family issue could happen at anytime, don't you think that, that child should have some kind of communication with there family when this such thing does occur?  Also what if a student wasn't in class when the teacher assigned homework and it was to late for that student to go back to the class and see what the assignment was? They could easily pull out there phone and send a text to a friend asking what was assigned for homework instead of getting a zero on that particular assignment. Don't you think that if using phones during free periods to do this such thing would help bring up student grades?  Allowing student to use there cell phones during school hours may have its up's and down's. but on the bright side student wont become so bored with school and decide to skip classes to hang out on the streets during school hours. When you where a child didn't you wish that you could use your phone in school? If so u know how the student feel about this situation. I thank you for you for the time u took to read my letter and i hope to sit down and discuss this situation with you face to face. once again thank you!  sincerely, STUDENT_NAME		0
 Driverless cars are becoming an increasingly popular topic in today's technological world. As automotive engineers and developers continue to improve autonomous vehicle capability, the idea of self-driving cars seems less and less science fiction. However, this technology raises several important questions that need to be addressed before we can fully embrace the concept of driverless cars.  One of the main concerns regarding driverless cars is safety. With a computer system controlling the vehicle, there is a risk of accidents caused by technical failures. It is crucial that engineers and developers test these vehicles thoroughly under a wide range of conditions to ensure their safety on the road. Additionally, if an accident were to happen, there is no current protocol in place to address the situation. Who would be held responsible for the accident: the manufacturer of the car, the programmer of the computer, or the human who was supposed to be driving the car but was not?  Another issue that arises with driverless cars is the impact on job security. There are many workers in the automotive industry, including taxi drivers, truck drivers, and delivery drivers. If a majority of vehicles on the road are driverless, the need for human drivers would significantly decrease. This could leave many people without work, as their jobs are no longer needed. While it is true that new technology has created many jobs in the past, it is hard to say that the same will be true for self-driving cars.  Lastly, there is the question of cost. Driverless cars are currently very expensive, with the most advanced systems costing tens of thousands of dollars. Will the average person be able to afford a car that is fully equipped with autonomous driving technology? This raises questions about income inequality and the possibility of accessing this technology only to the wealthy.  In conclusion, while the idea of driverless cars is exciting, there are many issues that need to be addressed before we can fully embrace this technology. Safety is paramount, job security is a concern, and cost is a factor. As these issues are addressed and solutions are found, it is likely that we will see more and more driverless cars on the road. But it is important to approach this technology with caution and consideration for all those who may be affected by it.		1
If you had to make a choice between going to school or attending class from home, which would you choose? As time passes, this question will continue to be asked to students more and more. The number of students that have begun learning from home keeps increasing. Will we abandon our established educational system in search of a better one? Everyone has their own thoughts and opinions regarding this matter, but who is correct? One thing is for certain, no one knows what will happen. But, based on the facts that are available right now, we can assume that attending classes from home is very beneficial. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would be able to work at their own pace and it would lead to an improved sleep schedule.  A benefit of being able to attend classes from home is that it enables students to be able to work at their own pace. For students who understand new concepts relatively fast, there would no longer be a reason to endure the hassle of having to wait for fellow classmates to catch up. Students who need more time would be able to learn at their own pace without having other students make them feel bad for taking too long. Allowing students to work at their own pace could also lead to a decrease in the possibility to lose focus. When students are put into a classroom with other students, who work at a completely different pace, it can get difficult. Having to constantly put a stop to your learning or having no time to take a mental break because you are behind can make students lose focus. Learning from home provides students with the opportunity to take breaks and to be more focused. Being more focus is something very positive that could easily be improved by doing things like having a good sleeping schedule.  Having a better sleep schedule is another benefit of attending classes from home. A better sleep schedule is extremely beneficial to students. Not having to wake up early to go to school would allow students to sleep more. It is common knowledge that one of the most debated topics regarding schools is what time schools should start. Extensive research has shown that students would function better if school started later. Giving students the option to learn from home and wake up later would benefit them by allowing them to be more focus which would lead to them being more productive. Another reason as to why waking up early does not work is because students often have to complete assignments that require a lot of time. They go to sleep late to complete them on time. Going to sleep late and then having to wake up early is unhealthy. Attending classes from home would increase the time students have on their hands so they would be able to complete assignments faster. Combining these two together, we are able to see how drastically the sleep schedule of a student can improve. Although, there are many positives with attending classes from home, people are always going to find negatives.  A negative that people would argue for is that attending classes from home wouldn't work because there is no real interaction between the student and the instructor. They would argue that students would not be able to ask for help. This sounds like very reasonable remark but they can easily be proven wrong. If a student ever needs extra help or just wants to ask a few questions they could always schedule a conference, via video calling, with their instructor. Another way that a student can have his or her question answered is by simple looking it up online. Nowadays there are so many different websites and  YouTube videos that can be easily found regarding any subject. Students would have all the help they could need!  In conclusion, students would benefit from attending classes from home because their sleeping schedule would improve and they can work at their own pace. Not having to go to sleep late or wake up early would make it easier for students to have a more consistent and healthy sleep schedule. Decreasing the amount of distractions and not having to work at the rhythm of other classmates would make it possible for students to work at their own pace. These two combined would be sufficient evidence as to why students would benefit from attending classes from home. So, what would you do?¬†		0
I think you should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. The progam lets you see sights that you would never see in your life. The program also lets you help people that need food. While you are out on the water you get to relax for a while and get away from loud city noises.  The first reason you should consider signing up is that you get to see beautiful sights in different countries. Going and seeing different countries is something you would never do in your life but, if you sign up you will be able to go and see things that you would only see in pictures. Going to these countries is a once in a lifetime opportunity.  The second reason to sign up is that you get to help people. While your gone you get to help people have a better life. You get to get them cows , chickens ,etc, to help them farm and get better meals. Getting people food saves their life and betters it. It is not as easy as going out to the store and buying food that you need. They have to farm and grow crops to eat. Giving people food that they need gives you a warm fuzzy feeling.  The third reason that you should sign up is that while your on water you get to relax and get away from loud city noises. Getting away from the city for awile is good, you get to figure out how to live away from the city. Also you get to relax and just hear the sound of water hitting the sand.  You could probably get a better night sleep after you hear the water.  I think you should go to the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to see amazing sights , you get to help people, you also get to relax on the water. These are three reasons I think you should sign up. 		0
Hey, y'all!  So, like, determination is totes important, you know? It's like, the fuel that keeps you going when things get tough. I know, 'cause I've been there.   Last year, I was determined to make the basketball team.  I mean, I had always loved playing ball, but I was never really good at it.  Like, I'm pretty sure I'm the only person who can miss a layup from two feet away.  But, I digress. So, I was determined to get better, and I practiced every day after school. I ran sprints, did push-ups, and even watched videos of professional players to learn new moves. And, you know what? It worked!  I made the team!   But, it wasn't just about basketball. Determination has helped me in other areas of my life too. Like, when I was struggling in math class, I was determined to get a better grade. So, I started studying more, asking questions in class, and even got a tutor. And, boom! My grade went from a C to a B+.  It's like, determination is like a superpower or something.   Now, I know there are gonna be times when you'll face obstacles, and it'll be hard to keep going.  But, that's where determination comes in. It's like, the harder the obstacle, the more determined you should be to overcome it.  It's like, when life gives you lemons, you gotta make lemonade.  Or, in my case, when life gives you a layup, you gotta slam it through the hoop!   In conclusion, determination is like, super important. It helps you accomplish your goals, even when things get tough.  So, the next time you're facing an obstacle, just remember: determination is like a superpower.  Keep on keepin' on, and you		1
Now you may have heard of something on Mars that looked like a huge rock formation. You may have thought it was created by aliens, but here at NASA I am here to tell you that it's just a mesa.  Well in 1976 we discovered something on Mars that looked like a face! At first we thought it was something like what you think now, we thought it was aliens. The excitement was short lived for us because we ended up saying that "Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa" so that made it disappointing for us. You may say that the landform is created by aliens and we're just hiding it from you, but you're sorely mistaken because this discovery would help NASA as a whole if we did reveal it. That's just one of many reasons that we aren't lying about it being a landform.  Another reason that we are completely sure it's a landform is because we can't spot any sign of life on the face. As we said "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size," "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" So even if you thought we were lying saying "Oh this image is a lie they have secret ones that actually show that there's life on Mars in their building," you would have no clue that there's no reason for us to hide life being on Mars. We wouldn't have anything bad happen to us because we discovered life on Mars we would get rewarded for discovering life on Mars so why would we hide it?  And the last reason is that we have factual evidence and credibility to back up that there's no life on Mars. Like we said during this speech we said that "And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform." Later on we did it again in the speech "Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. "We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view," Said Garving. "Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution." "Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo." Now you may say that we never did that, but we have photographic evidence of that clear photo that lets you see everything on the face. So we have the evidence we need to prove that this photo is real.  All together we have the proof that this special land formation on Mars that may look like aliens have built it, but it's just a simple mesa here on Earth something so common.		0
Freedom without a car  Around the world in different countries millions of people live life without a car. They either walk, run, jog, ride their bikes, or go on the subway just to get to work or go somewhere. Here are some facrs to know why life without a car is the beat way to life.  First, Having a car is wonderful by choice if you want it. A lot of families are so much better without a car. One women from Vauban says in source 1¬† "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." So not having stress is one of the ways that you wil get rid of and not having your blood pressure up. Let's say if you wanted to buy a house in Germany, you have to pay for that house monthly and on top of that have to pay an extra $40,000 just to park you car. That's a same that you just bought a house and have to pay for a parking place and dont froget about cellphone bills, morgages, water and electric bills, and much more. Without a car will bring less money out of yor bank account.  Also, to having car payments you have to pay for gas too or your going to be walking to work while your JAG sits at home in the garage. Diesel fule has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline in France. If you have a car that doesnt run on diesel the sorry hun you have to go somr place eles to get you gas. Car traffic... who doesn't like coming home from a long day of work and then have to wait in car traffic for longs of period of time. You are actualy waisting up all of your money and gas just sitting there waiting for traffic to move.  Last, maybe in the future there will be not that many cars being made. Studies shows that Americans are buying less cars. In source 4 it says that Americans can't afford new cars and with so many people not able to work and people getting into car accidents who knows they might invent moder bikes. With the government asking for so much on us and with the prices of gas getting up to $4.00 a gallon people want to save their hard working money. And without emassive amounts of money coming out of your bank you can maybe plain for a family vacation that doesn't cost as much as a car payment for 2 years.  In conclusion, to my perspective I don't want to pay for a car thats going to be more than what my house costs. Without a car I can go on long walks and be adventureous. See something that I haven't see since I was in a rush in the car. You never know what or who you will see when you are living free without a car.       ¬†    		0
 Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are a fascinating new development in the field of transportation. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel, offering greater convenience, safety, and efficiency. But they also raise a wide range of ethical and legal questions, which need to be addressed as these cars become increasingly prevalent on our roads.  One of the biggest advantages of driverless cars is the increased safety they can offer. By removing the human element from driving, cars can communicate with each other and their environment more effectively, reducing the risk of accidents caused by human error. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with sensors and cameras, which allow them to detect and respond to other vehicles and obstacles in their environment. These sensors can detect when a car is moving too quickly or too slowly, or when it is not driving in its designated lane, and respond accordingly. In addition, driverless cars can communicate with other vehicles and with the road infrastructure to optimize their movement and avoid accidents.  Driverless cars also offer greater convenience and flexibility. With the ability to communicate with each other and with the road infrastructure, cars can move more efficiently, reducing the time it takes to get from one place to another. Autonomous vehicles can adjust their speed and route in response to traffic conditions, allowing drivers to arrive at their destination more quickly and with less stress. This means that people who are unable to drive, such as those with disabilities or the elderly, will be able to travel more easily and independently.  However, driverless cars also raise a number of ethical and legal questions. One of the main concerns is the issue of liability in the event of an accident. If an autonomous vehicle is involved in an accident, who is responsible? The manufacturer of the car, the owner, or the software company that developed the autonomous driving system? There are also concerns about the potential impact of self-driving vehicles on employment. As driverless vehicles become more common, there may be a significant reduction in the number of jobs available in the transportation sector. This could have a significant impact on the economy and on society as a whole.  Another ethical question related to autonomous vehicles is the potential for bias in the decision-making algorithms used by these cars. Autonomous vehicles are designed to make decisions based on data, but if this data is biased, the autonomous car may make decisions that are discriminatory or unfair. For example, if an autonomous vehicle is programmed to prioritize the needs of certain drivers over others, such as those who are able to pay more for the service, this could exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel, offering greater convenience, safety, and efficiency. However, they also raise a		1
Dear Principal,  I would like to inform you about the works and outcomes of community service.  Many kids in schools across the country perform a task to help others out. I believe that this is the right and just thing to do. Everyone is a part of a community and they should do their part to help in any way possible.  There is a familiar saying, "Charity begins at home." Yes, this is true, but you can take that charity to other places in your environment. Community can make a person, but people also make a community. Human beings shape the way of life for all people and creatures. People need to help out in order to keep a society friendly, civil, and fair.  Everyone needs a base to start off from. Many start from home, but others don't.  This is why school is a place to begin. Besides getting an education and being social, a school is an example of a hard working atmosphere. Kids help teachers, teachers help kids, parents help the school, and so on. This builds a person's character. TEACHER_NAME, you are the head of SCHOOL_NAME, and you have the job of making this school a great place. I think that the kids of SCHOOL_NAME should help you and your ways by taking part in community service. You have the power to enforce a rule that states every child must help in community service at least weekly. I already tutor and babysit some students of SCHOOL_NAME, and I help clean up my neighborhood. If I can do that, think of how many people could! Then we would have a healthier and cleaner community.  People look up to you. Please help others take part in community service. It will be for the better. SCHOOL_NAME is a caring school that would make its community shine. Let's start helping out! Getting involved is the first step to building a safer and stronger community.  Thank you,  STUDENT_NAME		0
Do you think students would benefit from being able to attent classes from home?  on my opinion students would not like the idea of taking more time to study, because nowdays students are very busy, stressed, and tired of school, they would not like to have to hear more stuff that has to do with school . besides some people are more smart and they could take the class just to see how thats going to help, but sometimes people dont try the stuff and thats why, they never know if they are going to like it or not.  Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students from home by way of online video conferencing  I think, students are not going to have any benefit to attent classes from home. some of the studends have to work, do stuff at home, or stay in school on other activities. students sometimes, actually need some help with some classes but they might not like to be taking the classes at home, The studend taking the class at home could get distracted by so many things at his house. While some other studends that have better grades and like school they could take the class, but they also will have homework and things to do at home.  Students would not get any benefits by taking classes at home because, the online class could be also start teaching the same work that the teacher already teach you, or either the online class could be teaching different ways how to solve a problem that the student will get very stressed and after that its not going to be able to learn something from it and instead helping the student the online class is going to make it more difficult.		0
First impressions can be incredibly powerful, but they can also be deceiving. When someone first meets another person, they often form a quick opinion of them, based on their physical appearance, their demeanor, and their mannerisms. Unfortunately, these initial impressions can be wrong and misleading, and they can influence our subsequent behavior when interacting with this person. While it can be difficult to change a first impression, it is possible to learn more and make better decisions about a person based on further interactions and conversations.   First impressions can be seductive in their reliability, but we must be wary of placing too much weight on them. People are complex and multi-faceted, and a single impression can only tell us so much. Our initial judgments can influence our behavior and cause us to have prejudices against a person we don‚Äôt really know. We must remember to take our time and get to know someone before forming a lasting opinion of them.   In conclusion, our first impressions can be unreliable and potentially harmful if we rely on them too much, so we must be wary of their powerful influence. Taking the time to really get to know a person can help us create informed and accurate opinions that can shape our future interactions with them.		1
Dear Principal,   I am writing to respectfully share my thoughts on whether community service should be required for all students. While helping the community is indeed important, I do not think making it mandatory is the best approach.  Requiring community service risks having the opposite intended effect. If the goal is to empower students to be engaged, thoughtful citizens who want to improve their communities, forcing them to volunteer could breed resentment instead of goodwill. Students may feel like it is just another chore or box to check off, rather than an opportunity to explore causes they are passionate about. Community organizations also deserve volunteers who truly want to help, not those who feel obligated.   However, I do think our school should actively promote and support voluntary community service opportunities. Providing a list of local non-profits always looking for assistance could inspire more natural enthusiasm. Recognizing top volunteer hours with rewards or college application recommendations may further motivate self-driven participation. Clubs focused on particular issues like literacy, homelessness, or animal welfare could organize fun group projects.   As with any extracurricular activity, different options will appeal more to certain personalities and schedules. Not all students have totally open availabilities outside of academics either. But for those seeking to gain experiences, build resumes, or make a difference, voluntary ways of getting involved respect individual priorities and choices. It may even spark lifelong habits of civic participation.  In conclusion, while the value of helping one's community is immense, required service risks having the opposite effect of what I believe is the ultimate goal - cultivating engaged, empowered citizens. Promoting optional opportunities that can accommodate various interests and availabilities seems a wiser approach. I hope these perspectives are useful as you consider this important decision. Thank you for your time and dedication to our school.		1
Many European countries have been making a move towards limiting car usage in efforts of halting pollution, adding exercise to everyday life, conserve resources, and improve safety for others. An example of this phenomenon is Vauban, Germany, where suburbs are not allowed to drive vehicles. Doing this has helped improve society by bringing people closer to each other and removing the stress of traffic. Other people create a holiday for this, Car-free day, where people can only get around by public transportation and walking. As countries become more urbanized, there is a lesser need for cars to get around as the city is closing in on us.  Various countries have been making cities more dense and bring stores and businesses closer to neighborhoods, with the idea of Smart Planning. This idea is making communities more compact, like Vauban's 5,500 residents living within a square mile. With this, the need of cars is drastically reduced, creating a stress free environment that is less polluted and clean. Also, to dicourage the use of cars, there are only parking garages on the edge of town and barely any parking spots, leaving more room for sidewalks and housing developement. People began to walk socialize along the way, allowing exercise and social benefits.  Car pollution has been a major problem ever since the first cars were made. In the Paris, the smog became so thick, they had to partially ban driving. Even license plates one day, the next odd license plates. Congestion was down 60% after 5 days of intense smog. This pollution was due to the French government subsidizing and favoring Diesel fuels. In this time, all public transits were free of charge and people walked to get to where they needed to be. However, delivery companies lost revenue, but exceptions such as plug in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying 3 or more people.  In America, the reccession has had a devastating effect on some people, many couldn't afford to drive due to gas prices, and sold their cars. "A study last year has found that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009". This means that Public Transportation, car-pooling, and pedestrian are becoming a more commonly used way of getting from A to B, and are more affordable.  Companies like Ford got together at the Mobile World Congress and laid out a business plan for a world in which vehicle ownership is impractical and undesirable. Their chairman, Bill Ford, proposed partnerships with telecommunication companies. They want to make cities that are more based on pedestrain, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportion. Doing this, they think it will save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.  The world changes slowly, and these ideas might never catch on. Today, there is a lesser need of cars as cities become more urbanized and as we start facing an environmental problem. Better city layouts are being made to reduce the need for vehicles by bring businesses closer to neighborhoods. People are sponsoring no car days, smog reduces, and people find that they don't need cars to get around.    		0
 Facial action coding system (FACS) is a tool used to measure and analyze the movements of different facial features. It was developed by Ekman and Friesen in 1978 as a way to understand the coding of emotion expression in facial movements. FACS involves identifying a set of specific movements, or "action units," that correspond to different facial expressions.  The FACS system is based on the idea that facial expressions are not absolute, but rather a combination of different movements. These movements can be broken down into specific units, such as raising the eyebrows, moving the mouth, or even blinking. Each movement has been assigned a number, ranging from 1 to 48, which corresponds to its specific location on the face and its function in the expression.  Using FACS, researchers can examine the movements of different facial features over time and in response to different stimuli. For example, studies have shown that different emotions can be distinguished based on the pattern of movement in specific facial muscles. This information can be used to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying emotional expression and to develop new strategies for emotion regulation.  One advantage of FACS is that it is a standardized system that can be used by researchers from different fields and with different levels of expertise. It also provides a quantitative measure of facial expression, which can be easily analyzed and compared across different study participants.  However, FACS also has some limitations. For example, it may not be able to capture the full range of emotional states or the subtleties of facial expression that are important in everyday communication. Additionally, some movements may overlap or be difficult to distinguish from one another, which could make it challenging to accurately interpret results.  In conclusion, the facial action coding system is a powerful tool for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying emotional expression and for developing new strategies for emotion regulation. While it has some limitations, it provides a standardized and quantitative measure of facial expression that can be easily analyzed and compared across different study participants. As such, it has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of emotional expression.		1
Car culture is deeply ingrained in American society. For generations, the automobile has been seen as a symbol of freedom, independence, and progress. But in recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. There are many reasons for this shift, including environmental concerns, traffic congestion, and the desire to live a more sustainable lifestyle.  One of the main arguments in favor of limiting car usage is that it can help to reduce air pollution. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. They also emit other pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. Studies have shown that cities with more public transportation and fewer cars tend to have better air quality.  Another reason to limit car usage is to reduce traffic congestion. Traffic is a major problem in many cities, and it can waste a lot of time and money. Congestion can also be a source of stress and frustration. When people drive less, there is less traffic on the roads, which leads to shorter travel times and less frustration.  Finally, many people are choosing to limit car usage because they want to live a more sustainable lifestyle. Cars require a lot of resources to produce and maintain, and they generate a lot of pollution. By walking, biking, or taking public transportation instead of driving, people can reduce their impact on the environment and help to create a more sustainable future.  Of course, there are also some challenges associated with limiting car usage. For example, it can be difficult to get around without a car in many places. Public transportation may not be available in all areas, and it can be expensive to take taxis or ride-sharing services. Additionally, some people may not feel comfortable walking or biking in certain areas, especially at night or in bad weather.  Despite these challenges, there are many benefits to limiting car usage. If we can find ways to make it easier and more convenient for people to get around without cars, we can create healthier, more sustainable communities for everyone.  There are a number of things that can be done to make it easier and more convenient for people to get around without cars. One important step is to improve public transportation. This means making sure that buses, trains, and subways are reliable, affordable, and accessible to everyone. Another important step is to build more bike lanes and sidewalks. This will make it safer and easier for people to walk or bike to their destinations. Finally, we need to make it easier for people to share cars. This can be done through car-sharing programs or by making it easier to rent cars by the hour.  If we can make it easier and more convenient for people to get around without cars, we can create healthier, more sustainable communities for everyone. By reducing air pollution, traffic congestion, and our reliance on fossil fuels, we can improve our quality of life and protect the environment for future generations.		1
In today's day and age, technology has drastically increased. People seem to rely on the use of their devices more than anything. Typically, whenever and wherever, everyone is engaged in some form of technology, cell phones in particular. From pagers, to car phones, to initial "flip-phones", and now to smart-phones, people practically use up most of their daily time with these devices. Nowadays, a lot of people doesn't even like to have phone conversations...they can deliver their entire thought through a simple text message. In some retrospect, that's a very good thing; in others, it can be extremely crucial, especially when it comes to texting and driving. Texting and driving has been the leading cause of car accidents in the recent years  It can extremely dangerous to text and drive on the road it put people in danger they are more focus on the insolent paying accident to the road increases the chance that the drive can lose the control of the venice and could cause a crash or even incident a worst case could kill other people is text and drive. Texting while driving has become the number one driving distraction for many people. Drivers need to be aware of the dangers and keep their attention on the road, not on their cell phones or other mobile devices  These advertisements are hard to watch. No driver wants to think about being responsible for a traffic accident that takes his or her own life or the lives of other motorists or pedestrians. Nevertheless, most drivers still use their cell phones while operating their vehicle. While taking a phone call is dangerous enough, the advent of text messaging made cell phones even more incompatible with driving a car. Reading or sending a text or email takes both eyes off of the road, your mind off the task of driving, and sometimes both hands off the wheel  It can be dangerous to text and drive and in the united stated have around one out ten people are killed other people off the earth from text and driving Because it's an issue of attention-and there is only minimal extra distraction when picking up or holding a phone-it doesn't really help to use a hands-free device. Merely thinking about something other than the road is enough to strain attention and increase your risk of a crash.  You should not text on your cell phone while driving because being distracted by texting is similar to driving while intoxicated. Texting on the phone while driving can cause you to react more slowly when an unexpected driving hazard emerges or perhaps to never see the hazard until it's too late for the other people in the car to not to get hunt other on the road the haved a red light to having crash car and to texting and drive.  Example : less death , better drive , less car accident .      		0
Meat is a major part of many people's diets. However, there is a growing movement that suggests reducing the amount of meat that we consume. These people argue that eating meat is bad for the environment and for our health. In this essay, I will argue against adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet.  Firstly, meat is an important source of protein, which is necessary for the growth and repair of our bodies. Without meat, it is difficult to get enough protein in our diets. This is especially important for young people, who need protein to support their growth and development. Additionally, meat is a convenient and accessible source of protein, making it a practical choice for many people.  Secondly, the production of meat is not as harmful to the environment as some people suggest. Yes, it is true that the livestock industry produces greenhouse gas emissions, but these can be reduced through sustainable farming practices. In fact, some studies have shown that grass-fed beef can actually be better for the environment than plant-based alternatives. Furthermore, the demand for meat is not going away anytime soon, so it is important to find ways to produce it sustainably.  Thirdly, there are many delicious and nutritious ways to include meat in our diets. For example, a juicy steak or a hearty bowl of beef stew are both tasty and nutritious options. Meat can also be incorporated into a variety of dishes, such as stir-fries, curries, and pasta sauces. This means that there are plenty of ways to include meat in our diets without sacrificing flavor or nutrition.  Finally, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can be difficult and expensive. Many plant-based alternatives to meat are costly, and it can be challenging to ensure that you are getting all the nutrients that your body needs. This is especially true for people with busy schedules or limited access to healthy food options.  In conclusion, while there are some valid concerns about the environmental and health impacts of meat consumption, I believe that adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is not the best solution. Instead, we should focus on finding sustainable ways to produce meat and incorporating it into our diets in a responsible and nutritious way. This will allow us to enjoy the benefits of meat while also doing our part to protect the environment and our health.		1
How do you feel about the electoral college? It's really useless if you ask me. Where not even voting for the president "but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." Just think about what i said and try to make sense of it.  Electoral collage is very useless why do i say this you may ask. Well like source 2 says and gives you a great example "if you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledge to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes." A good question you might be asking yourself is, that who are the electors? Well¬† they can be anyone not holding public office states source 2. Another problem is that the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. All you can do is just prey for the best.  Another good reason on why i feel very negative towards electoral college is that "Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people" states source 2. So you are basically voting for someong to vote for who you want to vote for and they¬† might not even defy your will. The electoral collage is just not fair to voters. "Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in sates they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in¬† the swing states.  Over all "electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational". They are completly right think about you dont wanna give the wrong person all the powers the president has.       ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    		0
 Yes, the electoral college works as intended. The system, established by the framers of the United States Constitution, was designed to give each state a proportional role in the selection of the president. It ensures that small states, with their limited resources and interests, have a fair say in the election.   To argue that the electoral college is flawed, one must consider the potential for undue influence from campaign funds, the distortion of the election by voter fraud, and the lack of a direct election. However, the electoral college mitigates these potential issues and ensures a fair and balanced decision.  First, the electoral college prevents campaigns from being won solely by winning in large states. Candidates must work to win over voters in smaller states, where resources may be limited and attitudes diverse. This ensures a more representative selection of the president.  Second, voter fraud is still a prevalent issue and a direct election could be susceptible to it. The electoral college, with its checks and balances, minimizes the potential impact of fraud and ensures a more reliable outcome.  Finally, the electoral college ensures a balanced decision. By giving equal representation to each state, it ensures that the selection of the president is not skewed by the majority of the population. If a presidential candidate were to win a popular vote, but lose the electoral vote, the system would still ensure a balanced outcome, and the candidate who won over more voters would be chosen as president.  In conclusion, the electoral college works as intended by ensuring a fair and balanced selection of the president. It gives each state a proportional role in the election and minimizes the impact of campaign funds, voter fraud, and the influence of the majority of the population. The system will continue to work effectively as long as it is respected and implemented properly.		1
The students are very mad that the principal is considering that you have to have a b average instead of having a c average to play sports or other activities. At the school so I think you need to do good in school to play or do school. stuff or you can talk to the principal and try to change his mind and get people to play, or you can talk to the teachers and get them to change his mind that will work to he mite do it and he mite not any way you tried to get him to change his mind or if you do good in school that mite do the trick to. If you do not change the policy i will not do any work at the school and we will be arguing about this. Do not think we will let this go we will not.		0
Students that are currently enrolled in schools have been the generation to grow up with new technological advances and harder school programs. With this, distance schooling is not a crazy idea and it may even allow for students to do better and acheive more. As a student currently enrolled in a multitude of AP or DE classes, I can agree that distance learning may be a good source for students that can't attend school for whatever reason. With distance learning students will be able to better their education when they are sick and need to take leave, need a bit of extra help outside of the classroom, and finally for students that have mental disorders or are diseases that limit their ability to go out.  In many cases, espicially in high school, students will avoid missing school when they are sick becasue the benefit of staying home to heal from sickness does not exceed the cost of missing school. High school classes hand out tremendous amounts of work that pile up on students: if students were to miss one day it would turn into weeks of work. Due to the excessive amounts of work, the majority of students prefer to tough it out and go to school. Since students are going to school ill, this provides the oppertunity for students to contaminate the school leaving others at risk of becoming sick. If distance learning was an option it would limit the exposure of sick individuals to the general school population. With distance learning students would then be able to watch videos or online conference with their teachers so that they don't miss anything important during class.  Another benefit that distance learning may have is the ability for students to gain extra help. For many students the learning pace during school is too fast and hard to keep up with, but with the use of distance learning students would be able to watch videos at home or conference privately with their teachers. Along with a fast learning pace, some students may feel embaressed or shy during class and don't like asking questions. Through online video conferencing students can ask their teachers one on one questions privately. Some people believe that if a student doesn't understand a lesson or can't ask questions during class that its their own fault and should have to deal with it on their own by getting a tutor. Although tutors are an excellent tool, they are costly and some students may have to work after school or play sports leaving them no time for extra help outside of school. Through distance learning students can access the extra help they need by opening there laptop to watch a video compared to spending excess amounts of money and time on a tutor.  Finally, distance learning would be able to help those that can't attend school, physically or mentally. Today in society more than a fourth of the population suffers from some sort of mental or physical disorder which limits the way they preform during school.  I know a number of poeple that suffer from a disorder like Anxiety or ADHD and can't preform well during school and have to wait to get home to complete their work. Since these students can't focus in a busy environment, like the classroom, they don't learn during class and have to teach themselves the lesson at home. Since they are teaching themselves the material they often miss information or the inforamtion is wrong.  For students that have physcial disabilities or diseases and can't leave there home or the hospital, they would still be able to learn like a "normal" student in a classroom setting.¬†With the use of distance learning these students would be able to watch videos and conference with teachers to help learn and improve their education.  People may believe that with distance learning comes a big price tag attached. However the cost of ditsance learning shouldn't be too high. Most students and staff have access to a computer or some sort of technology that will provide them the oppertunity to watch videos online or video conference with a teacher. Through distance learning it gives students so many advantages that were not provided to the older generations including allowing students to learn at home when they are sick, giving students the oppertunity to receive extra help, and finallly granting students with diseases and disorders the ability to learn in a classroom settting. With the use of distance learning it would provide students with resources that other generations never had to help better their quality of education.¬†		0
Mostly everybody man focused today is when i become a teenager , get a job and get my first CAR .Cars are good to get around but there are some advantages of limiting car usage , like pollution and more money you have in you pocket for youself. Thats sounds good right? I know !  To begin with ,Paris has banned driving to smog (pollution towards the greenhouse).Contaminated air we breathe isn't good for are lungs-just are health period. Consuming to much carbon and make us very sick and ill. Somethings we need to get to are pretty far and to get to places on time is faster by car- which most people think but isn't the case. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Plug-in cars , hyrbrids , and or cars carrying three or more passengers would be good but what about are power plants , cant they be used for something else? Cars are a good tool to have but its causing problems in our greenhouse that we need to stop  Meanwhile in Bogota , car free day is going in a great path. Many of us been in traffic jams before,right? Sitting at a light 3 times before you get to go .Do you ever think walking would be faster ? On car free day in Bogota,Colombia Colombians didnt use there cars and didnt complain about it ; they used bikes,skates or skateboards , even took a bus! Now, thats sounds like some good resources to me. We all like good days and not stressed one so leave the car in your drive way and start using other things to get you to where you have to go. This could be a community thing to everyone aound you , every citie , and every state.  Fouthermore , Car dealer ships need business to , start making that dont produce alot of pollution into the air we breathe , use resources that wont cause mot damage , the ozone layer isnt at its best and we need to save it before it gets worse , take action before its to late !  In Conclusion , can be very useful but why use them alll the time ? theres other things that can get us around like bikes , buses or even just walking . Driving all the time can be a bad habit . Pollution is a biggie as well , pollution are air is very unhealthy , but car makers are about what the car is about and not what its producing to are world. No need for gas today ; ill walk!       ¬†    		0
 The cowboy who rode the waves refers to the famous surfer, Duke Kahanamoku. Born in Hawaii, Duke was not your typical cowboy. In fact, he was an Olympic swimmer and the first person of Hawaiian descent to win a gold medal at the games. However, he was also a skilled surfer and became famous for his ability to ride the waves with ease and precision.  Duke was not like other surfers of his time. He was not interested in the flashy tricks and maneuvers that were popular with other surfers. Instead, he focused on mastering the basics of surfing. He spent countless hours in the water, studying the tides, the waves, and the currents. He learned to read the ocean like a book, able to predict the behavior of the waves and adjust his technique accordingly.  Over time, Duke's skills grew, and he became one of the most respected surfers in the world. He won numerous surfing competitions and appeared in many movies and TV shows, showcasing his talent to audiences around the world. He was known for his humility, his kindness, and his love of the ocean.  But there was more to Duke than his surfing skills. He was also an accomplished swimmer, earning him the nickname "The Duke of Waikiki." He won two gold medals at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics in the 100-meter and 400-meter freestyle events, becoming the first person of Hawaiian descent to win a gold medal.  Duke's legacy continues to inspire surfers and ocean enthusiasts around the world. He showed us that with hard work, dedication, and a deep love for the ocean, anything is possible. He was a true cowboy, riding the waves with the same grace, skill, and determination as he swam through the water. His legacy will continue to live on, inspiring generations to come.		1
TEACHER_NAME,  Sir, this is an a very bad idea that you have concocted, and I cannot sit idle and watch you make this bad decision. The idea of changing school policy isn't a bad idea in itself. But the idea of not letting my peers take extra-curricular classes is a drastic change in the policy that we have become accustomed to.  Some students take these activities as motivation to do better in school, or to keep them out of trouble. It should be duly noted that RELATIVE_NAME has changed dramatically since his inclusion in after school tennis. He's gone cold turkey on smoking, and has converted himself into the Christian faith! That is only one example.  Every student has a story, a background. Sometimes, there is a glue to holding their life together, whether it be band, glee club, or football. Every student deserves a chance to have fun and do what interests them, and if it didn't interest them, they wouldn't show up to these activities.  Sir, I implore you to think twice on this possible change. Without these activities, the students might come to a point to where they don't respect you as much as they could. Instead, you could see what the students are struggling with, and get teachers to help them in there areas that are needing assistance. Maybe even instead of changing the policy, just add another after-school activity set on helping people in need. To help raise the C average to a B.  I respect that you are considering to do this all for our well-being, and that is obvious enough. But I think the answer to all of this isn't necessarily a dramatic change. I urge you to make a different decision. The students will respond more positively to a different approach.  With all due respect,  STUDENT_NAME      		0
The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and well-documented, including:  * Reduced air pollution: Cars are a major source of air pollution, which can cause a variety of health problems, including asthma, heart disease, and cancer. Limiting car usage can help to improve air quality and reduce the risk of these health problems. * Reduced traffic congestion: Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, causing delays and frustration for drivers. Limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion and make it easier for people to get around. * Increased physical activity: Walking and biking are great forms of exercise, which can help to improve people's health. Limiting car usage can encourage people to walk or bike more often, which can lead to a healthier population. * Reduced fuel consumption: Cars are a major consumer of fossil fuels, which contribute to climate change. Limiting car usage can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect the environment. * Increased community cohesion: When people walk or bike instead of driving, they have more opportunities to interact with their neighbors. This can help to build stronger communities and make people feel more connected to their surroundings.  In addition to these advantages, limiting car usage can also save people money. The average American spends over $9,000 per year on car ownership, including the cost of the car itself, gas, insurance, and maintenance. Limiting car usage can help people to save this money and use it for other things.  Of course, there are also some challenges associated with limiting car usage. One challenge is that it can be difficult to change people's habits. Many people are used to driving everywhere, and it can be difficult for them to adjust to walking or biking instead. Another challenge is that some places are not well-designed for walking or biking. In order to encourage people to walk or bike, communities need to make sure that there are safe and convenient places to do so.  Despite the challenges, limiting car usage is a worthwhile goal. The advantages of doing so are numerous, and the challenges can be overcome. By making a conscious effort to limit our car usage, we can make a positive impact on our health, our communities, and the environment.		1
Seven hours per day for five days a week and some students have activities to do after school, along with that students have mountain high piles of homework nightly. Some couldn't fathom the amount of stress that students are under today. For those reasons, a principal adding a mandatory extracurricular activity is understandable, yet unrealistic.  Seven hours of school for five days is a very large amount of time spent on academics, but some students also do sports, tutoring, or some other activity after school in the very minimal time they have. Students who participate in sports may have been doing it all their life, so adding an extracurricular could possibly affect their sports schedule. Other students may be struggling with an aspect of school and they go to tutoring for that reason. Adding an extracurricular could interfere with the help they need to succeed.  Starting from age seven students are asked to do homework. When students are seven and in 1st grade they may not have a large amount of homework; however, when students are in high school the quantity will only grow. While some homework may not take much time for one student, another student may struggle with the assignment. For those reasons, it would be hard to expect much of a student if they also have to participate in an extracurricular.  Plenty of studies have shown that this past generation of students have the the largest amount of stress scientist have seen in years. Whether that stress comes from bullying, home life, school work, mental health, or high expectations, stress is unsettling high in students of all ages. Middle school student worry about the transition to high school, and high school¬†students¬†worry about their transition to college. All students worry, even if those worries are irrational, they are still stressed. That is why adding an extracurricular could be too much to ask of students.  Overall, extracurricular activities¬†being mandatory sounds wonderful and has many pros as well, but when people look closer they realize that it would end up as a train wreck. Extracurricular¬†activities should stay optional for those students who have the time and the energy to do their absolute best.		0
Summer break is a time of year that many people look forward to. It's a time when students and teachers can take a break from the rigors of school and recharge their batteries. However, there are many different opinions about the importance of summer break compared to graduating early and spending time with family. In this essay, I will compare the importance of these three things and outline the pros and cons of each.  The first thing to consider is the importance of graduating early. There are many benefits to graduating early, such as being able to start your career sooner and potentially earning more money. Additionally, graduating early can give you a sense of accomplishment and pride in your achievements. However, there are also some cons to graduating early. For example, you may not have had the same opportunities to learn and grow as you would have if you had taken a more traditional four-year college path. Additionally, graduating early can be stressful, as you may feel like you have to rush to complete all of your coursework and graduate on time.  The second thing to consider is the importance of spending time with family. Spending time with family is important because it allows you to reconnect and bond with the people who are most important to you. It's a time when you can relax and enjoy each other's company without the stress of school and work. Additionally, spending time with family can be a great way to learn new skills and gain valuable life experiences. However, there are also some cons to spending too much time with family. For example, you may feel like you're missing out on other opportunities, such as traveling or pursuing your passions.  The third thing to consider is the importance of summer break. Summer break is a time when students and teachers can take a break from the rigors of school and recharge their batteries. It's a time when you can relax and enjoy the sunshine, spend time with friends, and pursue your hobbies. Additionally, summer break can be a great time to take courses and graduate early if you wish to. However, there are also some cons to summer break. For example, you may feel like you're missing out on the opportunity to learn and grow if you don't take advantage of the summer to pursue your passions. Additionally, summer break can be expensive, as you may need to pay for travel, housing, and other expenses		1
In the time we live in today everybody or almost everybody has a car. That's how a lot of us get around. People that were raised in the twenty first centry thinks that there's something wrong with buses or taxies. I truly believe that there's nothing wrong with taking cars off the road for a day or so. Maybe we should try it.  Saving the planet by doing something minor wouldnt hurt anyone. "It's a good oportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." This is absolutely true because our enviroment is already gettin clogged up with bad air pollutions. Also, people stress about getting some where on time."The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog." Maybe, the United States should consider it as a campaign as of trying to teach younger kids that everything isn't just about having a car. Taking another transportation that doesn't consider your car will help you realize that you can go out and explore outside of your car. Cars shouldn't really be your frist priority.  Municipal authorities from other countries camt to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic. "These people are generating a revolutionary change." Limiting car usage is like everyone who smokes cigaretts stop for a limited amount of time. Its a wonderful thing to do especially when its cutting down on bad pollutions in the air. "80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to the highways and only 20 percent to other transport." This is real selfish of the United States , this lets me know that even though we have our own transportation they dont really want to take care of the other transportations we have because they feel as if their not important to us. As far as I know a lot of people still rides buses,taxies,or even walk because they dont have cars. We should definetly take a day to leave our cars at home and get around by other transportations.  Cars aren't bad to have. They actually help in a lot of ways. We could always use a time to save the planet from pollution , accidents anything thats possible to happen in a car. Especially, if its going to help in the future or even help in the present. That time should start now . ¬†       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†       ¬†       ¬†¬†¬†    		0
Driverless cars are obviously cars without drivers. Many have envisioned such an idea as revolutionary like Sergey Brin. As a matter of fact google has bulit such cars since 2009. However some people see this as a flawed idea and see this as a bad thing. I'm honestly split about each side.  Driverless cars do have a lot of positives. They are ecologicly friendly, so they save both gas and money. Also, they are way more flexible than a bus could be, since it can go anywhere. Not to mention they are way more safer than normal vehicles, alerting people who are distracted by anything while on the road. Speaking of safety, that seems to be a marjor area that is adressed. For instance, when there is a problem the car would state it and giver the passenger the option to take over. Another way is the cars expensive sensors that detect when there's going to be a problem, and automaticly breaks the car to avoid any damage.  However, there is some glaring issues that must be adressed. First off people will get bored beccause they are passengers. Plus being alarmed of this everytime your dozing off, by the car itself, isn't going to help anyone, just annoy them. On top of this driving cars is a rite of passage into adulthood. Taking that freedom away is just wrong. Not to mention, whos to blaim in an accident involving two of these things from different companies. It's stated in the paragraph that new laws must be made for these kinds of cases, and that could take years.  In conclusion, I'm split about this idea. Driverless cars might be the next evolution for the motor companies, but it is flawed in some rather serious degrees. 		0
Extending the school day two hours in a four-day school week is a topic that has been widely debated in recent years. While some argue that this would provide students with more opportunities to learn and grow, others believe that it would have negative consequences on their academic performance and well-being. In this essay, I will analyze the potential benefits and disadvantages of this proposed change.  On the one hand, extending the school day two hours in a four-day school week would provide students with more time to learn and engage in extracurricular activities. This would allow them to delve deeper into their academic interests and pursue their passions. Additionally, it would provide them with more opportunities to interact with their peers and teachers, which would improve their social and emotional development.  Furthermore, this change would also benefit students who struggle academically. By providing them with more time to learn and practice, they would be better equipped to succeed in their classes. This would ultimately lead to better academic performance and a higher likelihood of graduation.  On the other hand, extending the school day two hours in a four-day school week would also have its drawbacks. Firstly, it would require students to attend school for a longer period of time, which could lead to increased stress and burnout. This could negatively impact their mental and physical health, as well as their academic performance.  Additionally, this change would also require teachers to work longer hours, which could lead to increased workload and burnout. This could ultimately lead to a decrease in the quality of education provided to students.  In conclusion, extending the school day two hours in a four-day school week has both potential benefits and disadvantages. While it would provide students with more time to learn and grow, it could also lead to increased stress and burnout. Ultimately, the decision to implement this change should be based on a careful analysis of its potential impact on students and teachers.		1
Driving While Using Cell Phone  Even though cell phones where not around for a long time it has been a key factor in us daily life to which it as reaches a point where people are now using cell phone even while driving. People use their cell phone for a lot of reason and important things, things such as calling, texting, emailing and more, these activities while driving increases the driver's risk of causing an accident. doing this not only put the driver at risk but also people and other drivers around in that area. Despite the danger that cell phone causes some people argued that it is necessary to use cell phone for emergency reason. However, there are proof to show that cell phone should not be use while operating a motor vehicle.  Texting is a very serious issue and people should take it very seriously.  we become so interested in what we are doing on the phone and forget that were still on the road driving while on your phone increase the chance 25 times more likely to cause a crash these bad decision that we made while driving always end up in death are serious injuries.  Not paying attention, and the hazards we face while driving is something we learn to avoid before getting our driver license. knowing the dangers, it might cost people still use cell phone while driving. People who work depend on cell phone like businessman, lawyers, etc. says that they all ways need to be accessible to their phone in order to keep business going and to secure client. Because of this selfishness, they put other people life's in danger. Research on google shows using of cell phone while driving is responsible for more deaths on the road. in these days we all are multitasking and it is difficult to put the phone down especially if you're on the road for a long period of time. However, it does not worth the cost of your life are someone else's.  Thousands of people die every year in transportation that resolve from cell phone use according to the national highway traffic safety security agency. 81 present of us resident admit to using cell phone while driving on the road. Driving while on your phone is dangerous because it causes distraction and crashes. it required three main types of distraction such as, visual, manual, and cognitive. 'Visual' distraction is the most common distraction, this is when drivers focus and eyes are taking off the road. this is when a person now starts to pay attention on their phone and not on the road while driving. the second distraction is 'manual', this is when driers take both hands off the wheel for reason like adjusting their GPS eating and drinking etc. the third distraction is 'cognitive', this is when drivers mind isn't focusing on driving this could be cause by talking to another person while driving, are having family issues etc.  drivers should consider the consequence of driver and being on their phone and make better choices for their self and others. If people don't stop using phones on the road the number of accidents will only increase more. It is Drivers responsibly to put their phone on silent and put it away out hands reach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             		0
 The concept of car-free cities has gained significant traction in recent years as people become more aware of the negative impact cars have on the environment. Car-free cities are cities that have implemented measures to reduce the use of cars or eliminate them altogether, encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transport. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of car-free cities and the challenges they face in their implementation.  One of the primary benefits of car-free cities is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are one of the biggest contributors to air pollution, accounting for approximately 40% of greenhouse gas emissions in cities. By reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint, leading to a healthier and cleaner environment for their residents.  Another benefit of car-free cities is the improvement of public health. Air pollution from cars has been linked to numerous respiratory diseases, such as asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. By reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities can improve the air quality, leading to better health outcomes for their residents.  Car-free cities also promote a more active lifestyle, encouraging people to walk, cycle, or use public transport instead of driving. This can lead to improved physical fitness, reduced obesity, and lower rates of chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease.  Despite the numerous benefits of car-free cities, they also face several challenges in their implementation. One of the biggest challenges is the cost of implementing such measures. Car-free cities require significant investment in infrastructure, such as bike lanes, pedestrian walkways, and public transport systems. This investment can be expensive, and some cities may not have the financial resources to implement such measures.  Another challenge faced by car-free cities is resistance from residents who are used to driving and may find it difficult to adapt to alternative modes of transportation. This resistance can be addressed through education and awareness campaigns that highlight the benefits of car-free cities and the health and environmental benefits of reduced car use.  In conclusion, car-free cities are an excellent solution to the negative impact cars have on the environment. By reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint, improve public health, and promote a more active lifestyle. While there are challenges in implementing such measures, the benefits of car-free cities make them a worthwhile investment for cities that are committed to improving the health and wellbeing of their residents.		1
Studying Venus Remains Worth the Risk  While exploring Venus presents clear hazards due to its extreme environment, the author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" makes a compelling case that studying this planet remains a worthy scientific pursuit. The information to be gained from Venus significantly outweighs the dangers involved, and with prudent planning and precautions, missions can be designed to maximize knowledge while minimizing risk.   Several key pieces of evidence in the article support continued Venus exploration. First, Venus represents an untouched scientific frontier with clues about the formation of terrestrial planets. Its surface pressures and temperatures recreate conditions unseen elsewhere in the solar system, offering a natural laboratory. Second, robotic probes have survived on Venus longer than expected, showing its atmosphere can be navigated. Advancements in heat-resistant materials also promise greater mission longevity. Finally, Venus may harbor clues about climate change and planet evolution, topics with pressing relevance on Earth.   The author acknowledges Venus is no place for sentient explorers. However, robotic missions can collect valuable geological, atmospheric, and chemical data while remaining remotely operated from Earth. With care taken in payload design, landing sites, and operation procedures, exploratory robots can significantly expand our understanding of Venus for acceptable risk levels. Overall, the plentiful scientific rewards and safeguarding strategies discussed make a strong case that Venus exploration merits continued support and resources, despite hazards, as part of humanity's drive to explore the unknown frontiers of our solar system.		1
Hey there!  So, for this essay, I had to research how technology can positively impact people's lives, and let me tell you, there are some pretty cool things out there!   First up, let's talk about how technology can help people learn new things. I mean, think about it, there are so many online resources and educational websites that make learning fun and engaging!  Like, have you guys heard of Khan Academy? It's this awesome platform that offers free online courses and tutorials on pretty much anything you can think of, from math and science to history and art!  And the best part is, you can learn at your own pace, so you can go back and review stuff whenever you need to. It's like having your own personal tutor, but way cooler!   Another way technology can positively impact people's lives is by helping them stay connected with their friends and family. I know, I know, it's easy to get caught up in the whole "tech is taking over our lives" thing, but hear me out!  With all the social media platforms and video call apps out there, it's way easier to stay in touch with loved ones who live far away. Like, my grandma lives in a different state, but we can still catch up and hang out online whenever we want. It's like having her right next to me, even if she's not  And it's not just for families, either!  Friends can use these apps too, so you can stay close even if you're not in the same room. It's like having a virtual hug, but way better because you can still see each other's faces!   Lastly, technology can also help people stay healthy and fit. I know, I know, it's easy to get distracted by all the screens and stuff, but hear me out!  There are so many fitness apps and trackers out there that can help you stay on top of your workout routine. Like, I use this app called Fitbit, and it tracks how many steps I take each day, how much		1
Did you know that only 10% of students in Generic_City participate in at least one extracurricular activity and only 4% of students at Generic_School as a sport, joining the yearbook committee, serving the student council, or any after school¬†club, the students at Generic_School would become more involved in their community and want to help their community for the better.¬†A study done by Harvard University in 2017 proved that only 30% of the students in Virginia participate in at least one extracurricular activity and of those students, 28% are active in their community and have helped their communities by fund raising¬†for an important cause, petitioning for changes in their communities, and encouraging good habits such as recycling and healthy eating habits. Although this percentage of students in Virginia is very low, the rate of students who are active in their community is very high, based on these numbers. This proves that if our students participate in extracurricular activities, they are also more likely to impact their communities for the better which is why we need this policy in our school. Not only could the students at Generic_School impact their communities for the better, but participating in extracurricular activities could also help our students make new friends and find new interests.  By requiring our young learners to participate in an extracurricular activity, we are also encouraging them to reach outside of their comfort zones and try something new. This new activity could help them make new friends and they may even find new and exciting interests that they never new they would like.¬†If our students stuck to the same routine every day and never tried anything new, they may never find any activities that may excite them and spark new interests in them. Therefore, our students would start to become bored in school and feel less encouraged to do well and study hard to get good grades.¬†When I was in the beginning of fifth grade, I felt excited to start off a new and fun year as a fifth grader. This excitement slowly started to wear off a quarter way through the year and I started to feel less encouraged to continue working hard and striving to get the best grades that I could. I was beginning to feel bored with the same routine that I had maintained over the past few years and I hoped that I could try something new and refreshing that would make me more excited about school and my everyday life. One day, my mom asked me if I wanted to try a dance class at a studio that I had never heard of. Out of pure excitement, I agreed and that whole week, I was looking forward to the day that I would go to dance class. When the day of the class came, I was shy, but I managed to make friends with all of the girls and I had found a new interest in dance. Not only did this new experience help me make new friends and find a new interest, but it also made me feel encouraged in school to keep working hard throughout the week until my weekly dance class on Saturday. My grades started to go up and I was more happy and encouraged to do well in everything I did. This new dance class had helped me find new friends, find a new interest, and get better grades. To this day, I still dance and I could not imagine my life without it.¬†Not only does requiring our students to participate in a new activity help them find new interests and make friends, but it also could help our students get into good schools in the future, and therefore get better jobs and become more successful.  By requiring our students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, we could also be helping these students get into good colleges and we could be setting them up for a very bright future. With this new policy, our students will be able to add to their resumes that they have participated in a variety of activities that may seem very impressive to college school boards, as they tend to find interest in students who have a variety of extracurricular activities. After going to a great college, our students will be sent into interviews for jobs. With their resumes saying that they went to an impressive college, they will be accepted into their dream jobs. This amazing future for our students is all because of this policy. Without it, we would be denying our students from the future they deserve. A study by Yale University in 2018 has shown that 80% of colleges base their acceptances of students based on the variety of extracurricular activities that they are in. This proves that with our new policy, we could be helping our students get into better schools. Not only will this policy help our students have a bright future, but it will also help them become better students and adults in the future.  Generic_School needs to require our students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it would help our students become more active and involved in their communities, it would help them make new friends and help them find new interests, and it would help our students get into good colleges and get good jobs, leading them to the bright futures that they deserve. This policy would be helping our students in the long run, and I strongly encourage that you will decide to enforce this new rule.		0
Should drivers be able or not be able to use their cellphones while driving.  I will explain how drivers can be able to use their cellphones and how they can't use their cellphones.  there are many resources that you can use to help you understand whether or not cellphone usage is allowed. there are some pros for cell phone usage and some cons for cell phone usage. I really prefer not using cellphones.  Drivers should not use their cellphones while they are driving because a lot of things could happen like getting in car accidents, getting pulled over by the cops, killing somebody else that is like crossing the road or street and you could get arrested. One reason why they shouldn't have cellphones because people insurance bill or rates goes up. People dealing with health problems and car accidents. Drivers be looking down at their phones and trying to text back to someone while driving which means that they are being distracted.  Drivers are allowed to use their cell phones only if they are talking on the phone while the phone is on speaker.  Drivers can talk on the phone through bluetooth headphones.  Drivers can also talk on phones, leave a message, call someone, and more on bluetooth in cars that only have a bluetooth speaker in them. If drivers have a passenger sitting beside them, then they could ask them if they could text, call, leave a message, or anything else to that person they are trying to reach. So there are some good with drivers having cell phone usage.  In conclusion   		0
Dear Principal,   I am writing to you regarding the reconsideration of the school's cell phone policy. Of the two options presented, I believe Policy 1 is better for our school.   Allowing students to bring phones but requiring them to be turned off during class time strikes the right balance. Phones have become an integral part of students' lives outside of school, so an outright ban may be unrealistic and cause frustrations. However, having phones out and potentially distracting during lessons is disruptive to learning.   Policy 1 respects that phones are a part of students' lives today, while still prioritizing an environment conducive to education during class time. Students would be able to stay connected with friends and family during breaks, which benefits their well-being and social lives. An outright ban may feel overly restrictive.  Importantly, Policy 1 sets a clear rule that phones do not interfere with instructional time. Teachers could focus fully on teaching without potential distractions. Students, too, could focus on learning without temptation to check phones under desks. This balanced approach considers the perspectives of both students and teachers.  In an emergency, allowing phones in cases but turned off could also provide reassurance for parents. Overall, Policy 1 adopts a common-sense stance that works with the reality of today's technology use, while still upholding schoolwork as the top priority during lessons. For these reasons, I believe it is the best option for our school. Please let me know if you need any clarification of my perspective.  Thank you for considering my input on this important decision.  Sincerely, [Your name]		1
Do you think summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed? In my opinion, summer project should be student-designed. For students, summer is a break from school; students should have the freedom to do a project based on what they want. Reasons why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students the ability to be creative, they feel less pressured, and it gives them responsibility.  First reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students the ability to be creative. If students come up with what their projects is based on, it shows their creativeness. They can describe and show their personality through their project. They can also show their character and more about who they are. This can be a opportunity for students to open up with their teacher and classmates. Students can come out their comfort zone and be unique when creating their project.  Second reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because students feel less pressured. If students have a certain project, they feel more pressured to do exactly what the project is based on. The project may be based on a subject they may not feel comfortable with. If students have a student-designed project, they will avoid that conflict because they will be able to choose their own topic. This may also pressure students because they could get a project that doesn't appeal to their personality.  Third reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students responsibility. Students will have all summer to create their project; if the project is not done, it shows they aren't responsible. The project shows if they can be able to do a project before the new school year begins. Certain students will prove they're able to complete a project throughout the summer. While others will prove they aren't responsible enough to complete a project. In addition, this will give them a task to do while they aren't in school.  In conclusion, I believe that summer projects should be student-based. My reasons on why I believe this should be a student-designed project is because it gives students the ability to be creative, they feel less pressured, and it gives them responsibility. A summer project should be a project you are comfortable with and can show how you unique every individual is. The project will also keep students feeling educated while not being in school.		0
As citizens, we all have a responsibility to do our part to protect the environment. One way we can do this is by limiting our car usage. Cars are a major source of pollution, and they contribute to climate change. By driving less, we can reduce our impact on the environment and help to create a cleaner, healthier planet.  There are a number of ways to limit our car usage. We can walk or bike to places instead of driving, carpool or take public transportation, or simply drive less often. If we all make an effort to make these changes, we can make a big difference.  According to the passage "How to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint", driving a car produces about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. This is more than any other form of transportation. By walking or biking instead of driving, we can reduce our carbon footprint significantly.  In addition to reducing our carbon footprint, limiting our car usage can also help us to save money. Gas prices are constantly rising, and by driving less, we can save money on our fuel costs. We can also save money on car maintenance and repairs.  Of course, there are some times when we need to drive. But if we can make an effort to limit our car usage, we can do a lot to protect the environment and save money.  So next time you're thinking about driving, consider walking, biking, or taking public transportation instead. It's good for the environment, it's good for your wallet, and it's good for your health.  In conclusion, limiting our car usage is a simple way to make a big difference. By making these changes, we can help to create a cleaner, healthier planet for ourselves and for future generations.		1
What do I think about using cell phones while driving? Cell phones are big distraction when using them or having a conversation. Driving is already dangerous enough because of what can happen in a car wreck. I'll tell you my opinion on this in my three body paragraphs in this essay.  How can cell phones be dangerous? Well they are a distraction and very entertaining so you shouldn't use them while driving. People like to listen to music and change songs while driving and not pay attention. Texting is another thing and watching videos because you be locked in on your phone. This is how I think phones are a distraction in today world.  How is driving cars dangerous in today's world? Well cars today go a lot faster and are very dangerous. They can cause deaths very easy by hitting just about anything or total your car. You can get distracted or cause a wreck and put other people lives in danger just by you getting in one. This how I think today vehicles are dangerous.  How do I think using a phone and driving is dangerous at the sametime? When using a phone while driving you might end up in the other lane or running a light or something. When doing that you can easily cause a wreck and be in the wrong by hurting other people and for being on your phone. That's why tickets are so high for being on your phone while driving. I think people shouldn't use they phone while driving in today life.  These are my thoughts on today about using cell phones and driving. I think texting and driving or using a phone while driving should be stopped. If they still choose to do so they should be punished. They should be arrested or pay a big fine. This is how I think I can better texting and driving and put a end to it.   		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I understand that this is a complex issue with strong arguments on both sides, but I believe that the benefits of a popular vote system far outweigh the costs.  First and foremost, a popular vote system would ensure that every vote counts. Under the current system, it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election. This happened in 2000, when Al Gore won the popular vote by over 500,000 votes but lost the election to George W. Bush by a narrow margin in the Electoral College. This is not only unfair to the voters of the losing candidate, but it also undermines the legitimacy of the presidency.  Second, a popular vote system would give all states a voice in the election. Under the current system, a few swing states receive most of the attention from presidential candidates. This is because these states are up for grabs and a small shift in the popular vote in these states can swing the election. As a result, candidates ignore states that are considered to be "safe" for one party or the other. This is not only unfair to the voters of these states, but it also means that the President is not necessarily elected by the majority of the American people.  Third, a popular vote system would make it easier for people to vote. Under the current system, voters must register to vote and then vote in person on Election Day. This can be a challenge for many people, especially those who have busy schedules or who live in rural areas. A popular vote system would allow people to vote by mail or early voting, which would make it easier for more people to participate in the election.  I understand that there are some who argue that the Electoral College is necessary to protect the interests of small states. However, I believe that this argument is outdated. In today's society, small states are no longer at a disadvantage. They have the same representation in Congress as large states, and they have access to the same resources. In fact, some small states have actually benefited from the Electoral College, as they have been able to elect Presidents who would not have won the popular vote.  In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and unfair system that should be abolished. A popular vote system would ensure that every vote counts, give all states a voice in the election, and make it easier for people to vote. I urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the President of the United States by popular vote.  Sincerely,  [Your name]		1
There are many different things that you could do to help out the ecosystem, and reducing your car use is certainly one of them. A study conducted in Europe shows that 12% of greenhouse gas emissions are the result of passenger car overuse. But of course as humans we are bound to resist and not give up things that make our lives easier. Yet there are many alternatives to not driving a car, for example car pool, have family members pick you up, buses, trains, taxis, bikes, etc. As you can see is not a matter of lack of alternatives but a lack of interest in helping out nature and everything that it helps support.  A very important way in which car usage affects our lives is pollution, many places around the world are trying to impose taxes and fines in order to keep people from overrelying on their cars. "After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city", things like this are quite obviously why the ecosystem is not at it's worst yet. One of the most polluted cities in the world Beijing competition for Paris until law enforcers stepped in to resolve the issue. Another city fighting pollution caused by car use is Bogota, who has once again banned it's over 7.2 million population from using their cars on the "Day Without Cars" event. The Day Without Cars is an event that if not followed could be penalize citizens most likely monetary fines of around 25 dollars, although some were even arrested for not complying with this method. Described by Andrew Selsky as a "program set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during this car free day". Not only is this helping out the rest of the world is bringing people closer as more people go to parks, sport centers and spend time together.  With more bans and restrictions on car usage of course the car usage is destined to decrease but although it might sound terrible it could actually lead to healthier lives. With less cars on the road the air you are breathing will be more pure and healthy and less polluted. More people will have to walk which will decrease heart problems, obesity and other diseases all over the world. If people don't buy cars then companies like Ford, Toyota, Honda and more will make less money and some might run out of business but that will not happen since most people are not ready to make a commitment such as giving up your car. But if cars are not being purchased then they will stop being produced which can lead to a better economy since the government won't be spending billions on gas, diesel and such. Apparently the amount of miles driven by a person yearly has decreased over the last couple of years which has led sociologists to believe that if this pattern persists it will have many beneficial implications for the environment, even though it could have negative implications for car industries as i stated before.  Car usage will decrease since people are driving less and less every year and young people are buying less cars according to a study in 2013 that found that "driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009". Even though many experts can't be sure yet, the drop in sales and decrease in usage has led many to believe that the U.S. has already peaked in miles driven and possibly car sales. There is no accurate way of predicting whether this will bring completely positive or completely negative consequences. President Obama's ambitious goals to change the greenhouse gas emissions has proven to shift or change the way people act as recent studies show that "Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by".		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.  As you know, the Electoral College is a system in which each state is allocated a number of electors equal to its number of representatives in Congress, plus its two senators. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district.  This system is deeply flawed. It gives disproportionate power to small states, and it allows a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016, when Donald Trump won the presidency with 306 electoral votes, but lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes.  There are many reasons why the Electoral College should be abolished. First, it is undemocratic. In a democracy, the person who receives the most votes should win the election. The Electoral College system makes it possible for a candidate to win the presidency without winning the support of the majority of voters. This is simply not fair.  Second, the Electoral College system gives disproportionate power to small states. Each state, regardless of its population, has at least three electoral votes. This means that a vote in a small state is worth more than a vote in a large state. This is unfair to voters in large states, and it makes it harder for candidates to win the presidency without appealing to voters in small states.  Third, the Electoral College system is unpredictable. In some states, the popular vote is very close, but the winner takes all of the electoral votes. This means that a candidate can win the presidency by winning a small number of states by a narrow margin. This is not a fair system, and it makes it difficult for voters to know who will win the election.  I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. This is the only way to ensure that our elections are fair and democratic.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
After Luke Bomberger graduation, he had two jobs he worked ar a grocery store and a bank. so when his friend ask him to go to europe on a cattle boat. in the passage luke said that he could not say no. It also includes that it was an opportuity of a lifetime.  In the passage i said that unrra hired "Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of horeses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas. and Luke and Don sighned up. I think luke sighned up because he was helping out on his aunt farm. So he knew alot about helping with animals.  I think that Luke and Don had a good reason to join that program.  Why i think that because they get to see alot of different things they never seen before. Also in the passage is states that Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been uploaded. He said being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him. He says " i'm gratefull for the opportunity."		0
Schools should allow student-designed summer projects rather than teacher-designed projects. There are a few key reasons for this.   First, student-designed projects allow for more creativity and curiosity. When students get to choose their own topics of interest, they are more motivated to dive deeply into learning. Prescribed topics from teachers may not align with individual students' passions and curiosity. By giving students freedom of choice, they can explore subjects they genuinely want to learn more about.   Secondly, student-designed projects prepare students for the future better than teacher-designed ones. In college and later in careers, students and workers often must work independently to solve problems and complete tasks with less hand holding. Student-directed projects foster independence, time management, and problem-solving skills that are highly applicable for life after K-12 schooling. Being able to self-start and see long-term projects through completion is an important skill.   Finally, student-designed projects promote engagement and excitement for learning outside of the classroom. If students get to follow their own interests, they are more likely to enjoy spending time on their projects over summer break. Motivation and enthusiasm are key for learning to continue when formal classes are not in session. Teacher-designed assignments run the risk of feeling too much like homework or busywork if topics are not personally meaningful. When projects are self-directed, students are invested in learning simply for learning's sake.   In conclusion, summer projects are most effective for continuing students' education if projects are designed by the students themselves. A student-directed approach allows freedom for creativity, independence, engagement, and passion-driven learning - all elements that are critically important for high-quality learning outside of school. As long as guidelines are provided on objectives and quality standards, students should have autonomy to pursue topics they find intriguing over summer break.		1
Technology is evolving and its evolving fast, for the fact that now we have a computer that may read students faces to determine if they lost interest and than alter the thing they are looking at. We will be talking about what this technology could leade to, what it may mean for schools, and how positive it may be.  Now this technology is quite advanced but, could it be a little far? Personally i feel this technology could be something positive in our lives but it could leade to many bad things. People will start relying on their computer to make them happy, people who have loved ones may just use a computer to read their emotions rather than actually trying to figure it out.  Schools are always trying to keep students happy, or willing to learn. But they seem to always lose their interest, so maybe it will help classes and maybe help advance students to a better grade or maybe even get them somewhere were they feel intrigued in. It could also help for the fact of students who are angry, helping them relax or putting them in a different situation.  This technology is very positive but still has its down sides. In my eyes, I see this as something negative for the fact being that humans need to try and reach someones heart and know them. We cant have technology just tell you if someone is happy or if they upset. You wouldnt really get any experience in social skills.  So to end this off, i do not agree of having this. This technology will end social skills and hurt schools for the fact of no one would be used to one another. Social skills is one skill everyone needs to have, learn, and use on a day to day bases. 		0
To whomever this may concern,  In my opinion, I don't agree that students should be required to perform community service. If they want to do a good deed and decide to, than that is their opinion of choice. But requiring them to take time out of their busy schedule, and making them do something they really don't want to do is unusual punishment. Choosing to help the community and help to save our environment is a very noble thing to do. Others don't agree that they should help because they have much bigger requirements they must attend to. They might have to take care of a loved one who is very ill, or perhaps attending to work just so they can keep the lights on. High priorities like those can not be put on hold. Others might disagree with my opinion, but I'm standing by it. But in some cases it might straighten out some of the teenagers, in my reflection it might make them rethink everything they've ever done wrong. It might make them realize that all wrong doing has consequences		0
How well does the author supports his details. The gives reason abotu venus that make it sound intresting to reserch and find information about. As the Author sayed Venus used to be mabye just like earth that had oceans and etc.  what the author is stateing. The author is stating that even thought thier is some dangers on Venus onday might have to leave earth and have to move to a driffrent planet. Venus is the only one that is most likey like earth and used to have oceans and rivers and mabye even used to have living creatures. The earth won't always be thier one we will have to leave earth one day which is like not intill a billion years.  Resonsings about Venus that make you carious about or want to do some reserch on it. Venus is the brightest light in the night sky and it is a evening star. Venus looks just like the other stars up in the sky only ecept venus is the brightest. Venus is the one closet to earth and is more like a twin to earth. Venus could have had living orgnasim living in Venus.  NASA has tryed many times to land on Venus.

Everyone wants to the know the right choice. People usually look for another point of view to make make sure they are making the best choice possible. Seeking multiple opinions on a situation shows you another thought process than your own. When deciding on big things like collage or a wedding dress you want to be reassured your making the best choice possible. You'll never know if you made the best choice until you hear everyone's¬†opinion. Almost 100% of the time somebody could have made a better choice than you and is willing to give input.  The first reason for asking for advice from more than one person is reassurance. Your brain always helps you choose the answer the inference is the best based on your past knowledge and your information on the subject. But no single person knows everything there is to know. Thats why we look to more than one point of view. No two people think the same exact way, because of that i'm always going to want to know what they think on said topic. Knowing how more than one person's train of thought works to get their answer helps me shift¬†my thinking to assure that I have selected the best option possible.  Specifically, one example is deciding on a collage. When deciding on a collage you take advice from your guidance consular,¬†parents, and collage representatives at fairs. Making such a big choice requires a lot of scouting and studying. When deciding on collages you look for a range of opinions to make the best choice according to the information you find. Your parents may have a different collage in mind for you than your teachers, thats when you use another point of view.  However, when consulting such a wide rage of views it may change your way of thought. If you were doing your homework and you asked what everyone else got and you got A, and they got D, it may lead to a learning experience that will become past knowledge. You may use that past knowledge sometime in the future and it will help you make a better choice than if you did not. However, you have learned a new skill that will help you in the future.  In conclusion, people ask more than one person for advice to make a better choice. They seek more than one persons advice because nobody has the same train of thought. Asking others for advice lets you see it from a whole new range of views. People seeking another thought process can help them make a better choice because you may think now that¬†they've explained it to you that their option is a better option and helps you make the right choice. And because Almost 100% of the time somebody could have made a better choice than you and is willing to give input.		0
Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This could be beneficial to some students depending on the situation. This opportunity could allow for the learner to flourish rater than drown by being overwhelmed. This could also be beneficial for those who struggle with being still for eight hours at school to be able to take a break every so often. It would be a good opportunity to those who are: being bullied, having trouble with mental health, and struggling with a unsuitable learning environment.  Students often say that school is enjoyable because their friends are there. However, there are some students who struggle to find those friends, which could lead to the development of bullying. These bullies could be completely ruining a student's life and more often than not the teachers never do anything about it. This type of situation could be toxic and decrease in the development of the student. These students often begin to slowly distance themselves further from school progressively, which could lead to a down spiral in grades. Allowing for these struggling learners to work from home would allow them to be in a familiar environment with no one there to influence them as a person.  1 out of 10 students struggle with some sort of mental health issue whether it be anxiety or depression; everyone has something going on in their head. These students with this issue could have severe social anxiety. For example, if a student struggling with anxiety is in a school with 1,000 other kids it might cause the student to have an anxiety attack. This could cause them to slowly dislike the setting and they will begin to take days off from school because they want to avoid the chance of the attack entirely. The grades will plummet¬†due to the absences, which is in the end not fair to these students struggling with the issue. The opportunity for these students to work in a peaceful environment will allow for them to flourish as a learner.  Students all have their own ways to retain information, some prefer visual, and others could prefer audible. This meaning that, everyone has some setting that works best for them. Some individuals could thrive in the school environment, while others could not. Given the opportunity, some students would take the chance to take the courses they regularly take at home. It could allow for these struggling students to take a break when needed and retain information better. This opportunity would be beneficial to the educational development of the student.  However, some students could abuse this opportunity as a way for them to stay home and do nothing. This could become unsuitable for those who need the extra push to do their work. These students could end up having too much free time on their hands and it could lead to the development of an unhealthy situation. This being said it understandable why the opportunity would not be given. But, the students who genuinely need this opportunity will not take advantage of it, they will use it to their benefit.  This opportunity that these struggling students would be offered would be extremely beneficial to their future. This option would be more beneficial than not as long as those who are given the option are monitored. This chance could allow them to reach their goals and accomplish achievements they never thought they could. The setting and the people in the school could be holding these learners back from achieving greatness. Not all people are in the same situation, not all struggle with the same things, people are victim to bullying, go though anxiety, and could not flourish in the environment their in. This chance would allow for the growth and development of the student mentally, physically, and emotionally.¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
 One topic that is frequently debated is whether or not schools should follow the model of extending the school day by two hours. Some people argue that because students can learn more, they would have more time to spend with friends. On the other hand, I believe that extending the school day by two hours would allow students to do homework, spend time with friends, and learn more.  One reason why schools could extend the school day by two hours is that many students struggle with their classes and need additional help from teachers. If schools extended the day, teachers could provide more time for students to ask questions and receive assistance in passing their classes. Students often have poor grades because they do not pay attention to their teachers while they explain, or because the class is boring or the teacher does not engage with students.  Another reason why schools could extend the school day by two hours is that students could participate in school activities or play sports like soccer, American football, basketball, and have more time to spend with friends. They could also help clean the school, decorate classrooms, or stay in the library and organize books or do homework. Additionally, students could use computers to search and find books they want to read.  A third reason why schools could extend the school day by two hours is that some students want to stay in the school to work on projects or homework because they do not have enough time to do so at home. Some students have jobs or other responsibilities outside of school, while others have a lot of homework from multiple classes, and this can make it difficult for them to keep up with their schoolwork. Teachers may become frustrated with students who do not complete their homework, and students may explain that they have too much homework from other classes and not enough time to do it all.  Finally, schools could extend the school day by two hours to give students more time to focus on their homework and improve their grades. Good grades and passing tests are essential for graduation, and if students have good grades, they will receive certificates of achievement from their school, and their families will be proud of them. They will graduate without any trouble, and universities will be more likely to accept them based on their grades and performance in college.  In conclusion, extending the school day by two hours would provide students with more time to learn, do homework, and spend time with friends. By providing additional time for students to focus on their studies, schools		1
The use of facial recognition technology like the Facial Action Coding System to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom is problematic and an invasion of privacy. While identifying students' emotions could provide teachers insights to better engage students, this type of monitoring also raises serious ethical concerns.   On one hand, the technology aims to help teachers understand how their lessons are landing with students on an emotional level. Knowing when students appear bored, confused or frustrated could help teachers adapt their instruction in real-time to improve engagement and learning outcomes. Proponents might argue this leads to a more personalized education.  However, constantly monitoring students' facial expressions and private emotions without their consent crosses an important line. In the classroom, students should feel free to naturally experience a full range of reactions without fearing a computer system is over-analyzing every micro-expression. Emotions are complex and personal, and automatic classification by an algorithm may misconstrue true feelings or lack important context about individuals.  Additionally, using this type of surveillance could undermine the student-teacher relationship built on trust. Students may feel less comfortable openly expressing themselves if they know a computer is reporting details about their emotional state back to teachers and administrators. Over time, this lack of privacy could negatively impact psychological development and well-being.   In balancing the potential benefits with serious risks to student privacy and development, the downsides of conducting ongoing computerized emotional surveillance in the classroom seem to outweigh the advantages. While technology that provides insights to improve teaching has merit, reading students' private emotions without consent goes too far. Schools should pursue alternatives that respect student privacy and allow natural human relationships in the learning process to thrive. Overall, the concerns about students' well-being and rights outweigh using this technology without meaningful consent in the classroom setting.		1
I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea. It can have it's pros and cons but I think that the pros overdue the cons. Three reasons why I think it's a good idea is because it tells you how someone might be feeling, if they are lying about how they feel or not, and that if they don't want to tell you, you can figure it out.  First of all, do you ever wonder on how might one person might be feeling? I bet you have. using the Facial Action Coding System can help with that. It can be hard because if you really care about someone and you might wonder how they are feeling. You can ask but what if they don't want to talk about it because it makes them uncomfortable.  Second of all, what if you ask a friend on how they are feeling and they say they are fine, but clearly they are't. People can lie about how they are feeling. They might show something but deny they are feeling some type of way.  Lastly, what if they don't want to tell you but you really want to know so you can help. the system can help with that. It would be much easier because now you don't have to ask and make them feel moe of what they are feeling.  In conclusion, I think that the Facial Action Coding system is a really great idea. It would probably take a long time for mostly everyone to have that system. But in the future there will be some type of system like that, that everyone can afford and have.		0
Hey there!   So, I reckon working in groups and working alone both have their perks and drawbacks, you know? Like, when you're in a group, you can bounce ideas off each other and come up with some pretty cool stuff. It's like, you can see the wheels turning in each other's heads and it's just, like, super collaborative. Plus, you can divide the workload and stuff, so it's not like one person's slacking off and holding everyone else back.   But, on the other hand, working alone can be pretty great too. Like, when you're working on a project by yourself, you can just focus on it and not have to worry about anyone else's opinions or, like, personalities. It's just you and your computer or whatever, and you can just get stuff done without any distractions. Plus, it's like, good for when you need to be really creative and stuff, because you're not worried about anyone else stealing your ideas or anything.   I think the biggest challenge of working in a group is making sure everyone's on the same page and stuff. Like, sometimes people have different ideas and it's hard to compromise and find a middle ground. And sometimes, people just aren't as invested in the project as everyone else, and that can be, like, really frustrating. But, like, when you're working alone, you don't have to worry about any of that, so it's just, like, way easier.   But, like, despite all the challenges, I think working in groups is still way better than working alone. Like, when you're working with others, you can learn so much from them and their perspectives, and it's just, like, really enriching. Plus, it's way more fun!  You can bounce ideas off each other and come up with stuff that's way better than anything you could come up with on your own. And, like, when you're working alone, it's just, like, you and your thoughts, and that can		1
Cars are not widly choosed over walking because things are to close and with less people driving less co2 emissions with is cutting back on the green house effect. 12% of co2 emissions are from cars and passenger vehicals. David Goldberg says '' since world war II transportation id growing quickly. Do to cars and there emissons pair has put a ban on them till the smog they have created clears up. Cold nights and warm days cause the emissions to get trapped in the air. Obama wants to put curb on the cor emissons and all the pollution that its causes. The united syates has long been the prime culture for cars do the birth place of the model T was in Detroit. Cars seem to be the big thing in the united states. Number of miles driven have grew scence 2005. Resources are getting closer and closer every day having none. The united states leads in car emissions.       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†    		0
Now and days, our world has transformed from using simple transportation to one source: the automobile. However, recent studies have shown our slow progression for the past years, discovering other ways of getting to point A to point B by having programs, reducing pollution and smog along the way, and living in an affordable economy.  To begin with, cities in our world have proven to be "carfree cities" by allowing programs to show other ways of transportation and reducing pollution and smog along the way. In Bogota, Colombia, a program where it is "a car free day", millions of colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work and as Enrique rivera mentions in source 3, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution paragraph 24". Colombia has been hosting this program since the 1990's and it has spread around the world the influence Colombia has done is beyond incredible. Although the program is not held everyday, it impacts the world slowly. Also, in source 2, the usage of car in France has decreased drastically because of the "intensifying smog paragraph 14". Because their tax policy "favors diesel over gasoline paragraph 16", they're required to use diesel, but the French decide to rebel to save the environment, in result causing delivery companies to complain. Although, because the French did use less cars it made the smog clear up. In all, programs such as the one held in Colombia influence all arts of the world with showing other ways of transportation and even saving the environment.  In addition, the world continues to reduce the use of cars because it becomes more affordable to the people. When the economy crashed in the United State's, people relied on their cars, until they realized it was too expensive to pay gas, pay parking, but needed an alternative and as it says in source 4, "people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit...paragraph 36". People do not want to go back to a car based economy. They're finding other affordable sources. Not only does the usage of cars affect people financially, but also emotionally. In Vauban, Germany, as a result of forbidding street parking, house garages and fee's, 70 percent of the famalies do not own cars and Heidrun Walter, a mother of two, who usually bikes, expesses herself about the situation in source 1, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,". Clearly, the use of less cars result in a finacial plus and an emotional change as well.  In conclusion, "car free days" are much more effective in a way that demonstrates the world other options of transportation, an opportunity to save the enoviroment, and an affordable economy to all.		0
I think we should be able to bring our phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as its turned off during class. I think so because if we could use them at lunch and free time we wouldn't have to use it in class and we would be paying attention instead of texting in class. The reason i choose policy 1 is when we have free time in between classes we could use our phones instead of having to hide them and not pay any attention in class, when we could use them and then be able to pay attention in class and have better grades. If we were able to use our phones in school when we were at lunch or had free time we would have better grades because we're paying more attention in class instead of trying to hide our phones under the desk and not paying any attention at all, because we're hiding them.  If there was an emergency and we were at lunch and we couldn't have our phones we wouldn't know what to do because we would get in trouble for having it out, and if we could have it with us at lunch we would be able to know what's going on. When we aren't able to have our phones on us and we do and it goes off it disrupts the class and we don't learn as much as were suppose too. Then if we have policy 1 you wouldn't have to worry about any phones going off or being token up because we would have done everything we had too at lunch or our free time. Sometimes students need a break from the learning and just need to use their phones to get their minds off things. Sometimes students with a phone can only use it when their in school because something's happening at home and they can only talk to the person at school. But again students would be better if we were able to use our phones at lunch or free time.  When teacher's sees students cell phones they take it up and they won't ask "oh why do you have your phone?" no they just take it up and if it was an emergency they wouldn't know because they didn't ask. Sometimes most students use their phones in school because either something happened to their family members' or their parents have to talk to them about something that they forgot when the saw them in the morning. Most students are talking to their parents when the get caught in class. When students use their phones in class its sometimes really important and they get their phones token up because the teacher saw it and they were lecturing in class.		0
 Positive thinking is often associated with success and happiness, as it can lead to better relationships and outcomes. When people have a positive attitude towards others, they tend to receive the same positive attitude in return, creating a cycle of positivity that can make everyone feel happier.  This principle applies to various aspects of life, including school and work. By treating teachers and colleagues with respect and kindness, individuals can create a more positive and productive environment. This can lead to better grades, more opportunities, and a greater sense of fulfillment.  Moreover, having a positive attitude can also help individuals cope with difficult situations and challenges. When faced with adversity, a positive mindset can help individuals stay focused and motivated, leading to better outcomes and a greater sense of control over their lives.  However, it's important to note that negative thinking can also have a significant impact on individuals and those around them. A negative attitude can create a cycle of negativity, leading to misunderstandings, conflict, and a general sense of unhappiness.  Overall, having a positive attitude towards others is a powerful tool that can lead to greater happiness, success, and fulfillment. By focusing on the positive aspects of life and treating others with kindness and respect, individuals can create a more positive and productive environment for themselves and those around them.		1
Dear Mr.Principal,  I think we shouldnt have to do comunity servise. I know some kids like helping out and that's good but other kids dont wont to and that's okay too. People have difrent interests and things they want to do.  For example my friend Sarah likes to tutor kid's and that's good for her but my friend Tom like's to play video games and that's good for him. We shouldnt have to do things we don't want to do.  Another reason is that some people have alot of homework and cant fit in comunity servise. Or they have family things they need to do like take care of their little brothers or sisters.  I also think it's not fair to make us do comunity servise and not pay us. It's like working for free. If we have to do it then we should get paid for it.  I hope you will think about this and not make comunity servise manditory.  Sincerly, [Your Name]		1
The decision that the principal made that students should get involved in the activities is an unethical idea.¬†Who would like to waste their time doing something that is not really beneficial? At school students have a lot of works to do, and now being in another activity might have a bad affect in their academic goals.  If a student get involved with the activities they wont have time for there daily work. They will have less time to do their homework or projects. This can keep students away from their academic goals. They also wont have much time to spend with family. which means that there will be problems with those relationships, and there will be separations between there family.  Getting involved in these activities brings stress for students. There will be one extra program added in their daily routine, Which contains more work. The work that they didnt choose to do, but the have to do. By having stress after this much work students wont get enough sleep, Which is an unhealthy situation.  Having this much pressure can affect students's grades. By spending their time on something that they dont really want to do, but they have to can put them in a lot of pressure which keeps them away from what they want to do. They will join these activities and wont focus on their studies. Students will start getting bad grades.  So, after this many reasons we all know that getting involved in the extracurricular activities can really hurt students. Joining these activities is neither healthy nor good for grades. All this shows that students should choose to be in the activities if they want to not that they are forced to.¬†		0
The challenge of exploring venus was being able to study it and what all was on it and what could live on it. the struggle of it all was not being able to land any bots on it to adventure and collect evidence of it all. Scientists tried working around it without landing something on it sinse it just gets distroyed while trying to collect data for scientists and hovering something over the planet didnt even work for them. Trying to build a divice to be able to land and last long enough is extremly hard for people for the fact that they have not and cannot land and survive Venus. unable to collect a rock and gas sample make things harder sense they dont know what chemicals are being used against they forces they are trying to take there. I believe that the body of this should be faced not feared.		0
Generic_Name  Mr. Generic_Name 10/11/20  Why People Should Always Get Multiple Opinions  When making an important decision, or just asking for advice, people should always talk to more than one person. Seeking multiple opinions will help them be more successful by giving you more views on a topic. If someone seek multiple opinions, they will make smarter, more knowledgeable¬†and better choices because they will help give you a more accurate response as well¬†as different opinions.  One key reason why someone should ask multiple people for their opinion is because they will get more accurate data. For example, If someone asked one person a question and they answered yes, then they would be more likely to agree with the person that answered, but if they asked ten people and only the first person said yes, then it would be unlikely for them to agree with the person that said yes. This means that people will be more informed when asking multiple people instead of one.  Another reason why someone should ask more than one person is because everyone has a different opinion. Their opinion could be based on their background, beliefs, ethnicity, wealth, gender and many other reasons. This means that it is important to ask multiple people because everyone thinks differently about certain topics. One example would be politics. People often have different political beliefs based on where they live, their race, their wealth, and other factors, because of this, it is important to ask people that are different from you in these categories. They could have a completely different opinion that you have never thought of, and could swing¬†your view on a issue.  Lastly, people that ask multiple other people for their opinions will often be more successful with whatever they are trying to do or achieve. If a someone asks multiple people, then the people asked will help them come to a decision. The decision that will be made will be informed by others that they ask, and will be better than the choice that they would have made if they had no help or advice.  Some people say that if someone asks multiple people for advice, that would mean that they would no longer be come up with an opinion for themselves. This is incorrect because a persons opinion is based on what other people say or do. With out other people to give advice, people would not be able to create the same opinions.  These are multiple reasons talking to more then¬†one person will help you get better advice than if you were to just get one opinion. Asking multiple opinions will give you a more accurate overall view on how people feel about something as well as help someone become more successful. Getting more than one opinion can even help people think about things they had not previously thought about or considered.   ¬† ¬†		0
 The electoral college is an electoral group that determines who will be elected as the president and vice president of the United States. The country is divided into 538 electors, and each state is allocated a certain number of electors based on its population. However, there is a debate about whether the electoral college works effectively and whether it should be abolished or reformed.   One of the main arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it gives each state a proportional representation in the selection of the president. This means that states with larger populations have more influence on the election than states with smaller populations. For example, California, Texas, and Florida have a combined total of 76 electors, which is more than half of the total number of electors in the country. This system ensures that the president is elected by the entire country, not just by large cities or states.  However, there are also arguments against the electoral college. One reason is that it can lead to a candidate ignoring certain states in favor of others. For example, in the 2000 presidential election, George W. Bush focused on Texas and Florida, while Al Gore focused on California and New York. This strategy worked for Bush, who won Texas and Florida, but lost California and New York by large margins. This means that a candidate may not be elected by the entire country, but rather by a small group of states.  Another argument against the electoral college is that it can lead to a candidate failing to campaign in certain states. In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump skipped campaigning in several states that were expected to vote for Hillary Clinton, such as California and New York. This strategy was successful, as Trump won several states in the Rust Belt that he had never campaigned in before.  There are also calls to abolish or reform the electoral college entirely. One proposed solution is to abolish the electoral college and have the president elected by a popular vote. This would ensure that the president is elected by the entire country, not just by a small group of states. Another proposed solution is to divide the electors by population, so that states with smaller populations have a greater say in the election.  In conclusion, the electoral college has both its advantages and disadvantages. It gives each state a proportional representation in the selection of the president, but it can also lead to a candidate ignoring certain states and failing to campaign in others. Whether the electoral college should be abolished or reformed is a matter of debate, but one thing is clear  C the selection of the president and vice president is of great importance to the entire country, and it should be done in a fair and democratic manner.		1
I think It's a really good idea, And students they will benefit with this idea, Bacuse they don't¬†have to¬†travel to school¬†eveyday, it will be a better option taking the classes only or video conferencing because is soo much easier. And i think is more beneficial beacuse i dont think, Students would want¬†to travel eveyday to school and back.  I think students they will benefit with this idea, because they are not going to spend that much money, In traveling to school eveyday.¬†It will be so much easier taking¬†classes only, because students¬†will have more free time to do their own things,¬†after they're¬†done with all their schoolo work at home: for example; if the students works it will be a better option of taking¬†classes only because he/she will have more time in getting ready for work, and been on time¬†to work.  Reasons why I say it will be a better option taking the classes only or video conferencing, It's because students they don't have to¬†worry, about gettig in trauble for been late to school, Because if students will travel to school schoool, there will be a high posibility¬†of not getting to school on time sometimes it can be¬†for many reasons; for example: traffict issus, parents they might get sick¬†or any other reason, It will be really hard for this students if schools wouldn't offer away to study and learn at home, schools they make it easier for this students who aren't able to come to school, Myself as student i think this is a really good idea made by the school, Bacuse it gives students the oportnity¬†of study at home when they aren't caplable to show up to school for this type of reasons.  I am agree with schools that offers distance learning as an option for the students, Because some students don't have the ability as others students, That has¬†the oportunity of riding the bus to school everyday from Monday to Friday, This students who¬†takes online classes is because they really need it, And they don't have a way of getting to school eveyday , It might be more difficult for them , because they might not have someone to explain them as well as a teacher. Another reason why i think some students students take only classes is because some classes that they like, some school don't have them, and they really want to know about it, Aslo sometimes parents look trought schools to see the classes option they have online so they can apply to see if¬†their sons can takes those classes online to learn about it. One of the major reason why student take classes online sometimes is because they don't have enaught credits, so they have to take classes online, Becuase even if they come to school they won't be able to graduate because they dont have all the credits needed, Some students don't live near the schools to come all the way to school so they decide to take the classes at home.		0
long summer breaks, such as internships or volunteer work, to enhance student preparedness for school.  6. Consider the impact of cultural differences on the academic success of overseas students during the summer months. 7. Analyze the potential benefits and drawbacks of traveling during the summer, such as the cost and safety concerns. 8. Discuss the importance of balancing relaxation and productivity during the summer months.  In conclusion, summer breaks play a crucial role in the academic success of students. Long summer breaks offer more opportunities for students to enhance their skills and knowledge, while shorter summer breaks can have negative effects on student preparedness for school. Traveling during the summer months can be beneficial, but it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and balance relaxation and productivity. Overall, students should strive to make the most of their summer breaks and use the time to learn and grow.		1
 The use of facial expression coding technology in classrooms is a topic that continues to spark debate among educators and parents. While some believe that such technology could be valuable in identifying students' emotional states and helping them perform better academically, others argue that it may invade students' privacy and have negative effects on their emotional development. In this essay, I will argue in favor of the use of facial action coding systems in classrooms, citing the example of the Mona Lisa and the findings from the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile."  Firstly, it is important to understand how facial action coding works. Essentially, the technology analyzes microexpressions on a person's face to determine their emotional state. The author of "Making Mona Lisa Smile" explains that the system was used to analyze the facial expressions of over 5,500 people in various settings, including in school classrooms, and found that it was able to accurately identify emotions with an accuracy rate of over 90%. The ability to accurately read and interpret facial expressions has the potential to revolutionize the way we teach and relate with our students.  In a classroom setting, the use of facial action coding technology could be useful in several ways. For example, it could help teachers identify students who are struggling or struggling to engage in class, enabling them to provide more targeted support. It could also be used to gauge students' motivation and interest in a particular topic, helping teachers tailor their lessons to better meet their students' needs. In addition, the use of this technology could help teachers identify any negative emotions or behaviors, such as bullying or isolation, allowing them to take action to create a more positive learning environment.  However, there are those who argue that the use of this technology could have negative effects on students' emotional development. They argue that the constant monitoring and analysis of facial expressions could make students feel uncomfortable and self-conscious about their emotions. Furthermore, it could be argued that the technology could be used to punish or shame students who are found to be expressing negative emotions, instead of providing them with the support they need to address the root causes of their struggles.  While these concerns are valid, they can be addressed through careful consideration of how the technology is used in the classroom. For example, it is important for teachers to communicate to students that the use of the technology is for their benefit and that their emotional well-being is a top priority. In addition, teachers should use the technology in a way that fosters positive emotions and behaviors, rather than punishing or shaming students. Ultimately, the use of facial action coding technology in classrooms is a valuable tool that has the potential to improve student outcomes, as long as it is used appropriately and ethically.  In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is a new and innovative technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we teach and relate with our students. While concerns about the impact on students' emotional development are valid, they can be addressed through careful consideration and responsible implementation. By using this technology to accurately read and interpret facial expressions, teachers can gain valuable insights into their students' emotional states and use that information to create a more positive and effective learning environment. As the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" demonstrates, this technology has already proven to be highly accurate and effective in identifying emotions, making it a valuable asset to any classroom.		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  Students do need cell phones at school at some occasions. But, phones are distracting during class and should not be allowed during classes. You should enforce Policy 1, let students bring phones to school, but make them turn the phones off during class, because if you enforce Policy 2, not let students have phones in school at all, students may need phones but won't be allowed to have them.  In times of emergency, students may need to call their parents, the police, the fire department, or other people while in school. With Policy 1, students would be able to take their phones out, turn them on and make a call. But, with Policy 2, students won't be able to make any calls and things could be very bad. Letting students use their phones during lunch or any free blocks will not hurt that student or other student's studies and should be allowed. However, students should not be allowed to use phones while in the library. The downside to Policy 1 is that students may try to use their phones during class, but you should instruct teachers to confiscate any phones that they see on during class.  I hope you agree with me on my choice of phone policies and that you do enforce Policy 1. It would help students and any other people in the school if students could use phones outside of class.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
Why call it extracurricular when you are required to do it? I disagree that you have to stay after school because what if you have a job,parents are divorced¬†,have no time to chill with friends, and if you have to walk home with your siblings.  What if you have a job then you would not be able to sat after. The reason why you can't stay after is if you have a job you have to get ready, you have to take a shower. You might even have to do choirs if your parents give you some when you come home from school then you have to leave for work and on top of that you might have to do homework.  What if your parents are divorced. If your parents are divorced then then you might not be able to see your mom and your dad as much. Without being able to see your parents as much that will leave you and your parents depressed do to the mental health problems that occurs when your parents divorce.  If you are required to stay after school then you wont have as much time to hang out with your friends. When you are at school for so long you get anxious because all you are doing is traveling to room to room all day then they add even more time to the day its just bound to have more frequent fights. But not only that you dont get to see your friends as much because by the time you are getting home its becoming dark outside.  When you have to stay after you can't walk your siblings to your house. The nice thing about getting off ealer then the elementary school kids is when you get out of school you can walk to there school then wait for your siblings. But if you are required to stay after school then you cant walk them to the house which would mean that they would walk by them self¬†or a parent would have to quit there job to make sure there child gets home safely.  In conclusion, You should not make it required to stay after school because we might have a job,parents that are divorced,wont have much time to chill, and our siblings might have to walk there house by them self.¬†		0
When you drive a car you are putting out emisions that are harmful to your children or your family members. So when you think about you could do to limit that, the answer is in the question. When your child goes to school they should ride the bus or if close enought ride a bike or walk. As stated in Source 1:In German Suburb,Life Goes On without Cars; they have elminiated the facor of the building up of smog.  Now as that is a good thing,not everyone should have such restrictive laws or rules that make it almost useless to have. A car-free city that is losing money on the gas that is need to use the cars, are losing money and they are making the money back by feeing you when you dont listen to them. in paragraph 3,there is a quote that states - "when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way," that cant be intirely true. When foced to find a diffrent way to work,or school,or home you are putting a burdan on yourself and community.  You are putting stress on your body that can result in back,leg, and knee injury when you have to walk home. Not everyone is fit enough to walk home or to work or wherever you have to go.  In Source 2: Paris bans drving due to smog; they have fined 4,000 people for this issue they are trying to solve. It will never be solved. they are making more money while in the process of trying to eliminate he smog that will alway be there. But it sure has help with the congestion of the capital of France. It haas gone down by 60% after just five days. As they banned diesel fuel in france they have also lost the money that they need to be safe from the inpending fear of something horrible happening and making them lose money.  When you ban something that makes p for 67% of vehicles in france you must find a diffrent way to people from point a to point b in such a big city. When they have to use the subway or the bus or taxi there will need to be more of them so everyone can get on.  When fining people for there "mistake" of haaving their car in use the day of car free capital day,they are making money off of you and what are they going to spend it on? more tanks or weapons for there military? How about for the debt that they trying to pay off? In every country there is something that they need money for.  As in the Source 4: The End of Car Culture; "the american love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling." Many people will be losing there job because of what is going to happen when no one wants a car anymore. The reason older people still keep their license and car is because they know what it is like when you have to march your way to the store and buy food for your family and then lugg them all the way back by yourself.       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†    		0
 Technology has had a profound impact on society, changing the way we communicate, work, and live our lives. While technology has brought about many benefits, it has also created new challenges and problems.  One of the most significant ways that technology has changed our lives is through the way we communicate. With the rise of social media, instant messaging, and video conferencing, people can now connect with each other from anywhere in the world in real-time. This has made it easier for people to maintain relationships with friends and family, collaborate with colleagues, and access information from anywhere.  However, this increased connectivity has also led to a decline in face-to-face communication, as people often prefer to interact with others through screens rather than in person. This has led to concerns about the impact of technology on social skills, as well as the potential for misunderstandings and miscommunications to occur.  Another way that technology has changed our lives is through the way we work. With the rise of remote work, people can now work from anywhere, anytime. This has led to increased flexibility and productivity, as well as the ability to work from anywhere in the world.  However, this increased flexibility has also led to challenges, such as the need for self-discipline and motivation, as well as the potential for burnout and isolation. Additionally, remote work can make it difficult for people to collaborate and communicate effectively, as they may not have access to the same resources and tools as their colleagues.  Finally, technology has also had a significant impact on our health. While technology has brought about many advancements in medicine and healthcare, it has also led to new health problems, such as sedentary lifestyles and eye strain from prolonged screen use.  Additionally, technology has also been linked to increased rates of depression and anxiety, as people may feel disconnected from others and overwhelmed by the constant barrage of information and stimulation.  Overall, technology has had a profound impact on our lives, bringing about many benefits but also creating new challenges and problems. It is important for individuals and society as a whole to be mindful of these impacts and to use technology in a responsible and balanced way.		1
Imagine a life without cars. All those paved roads completely empty with no traffic and no honking horns. Sounds like a peaceful community to me. Limiting cars could be a huge advantage to our world. Reducing these big pieces of metal flying all over our roads could help our enviornment, save tons of money, and improve our saftey.  Recently, I've heard about all the well known car dealers pushing hybrid cars and trying to design a enviornment friendly vehicle. But in reality, the only big step to helping our planet is to reduce cars overall. Studies shown that green house gases are "... up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States". Not only is the green house gas rate going up, but pollution, carbon emissons, and smog are as well. In Paris, France they had to ban driving for a couple of days as the pollution produced smog. "[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London...". The numbers keep rising in Europe and the USA. Picture what our enviorment is going to be like in 20 years if we keep this pace up. Without these machienes we could reduce the number of micrograms, produce the harmful gases from affecting the enviroment, and stop polluting the air we breathe.  Everyone likes to save money, whether it's with coupons or getting the best prices possible. So how would you feel if you had the abilty to save thousands of dollars a year? With reducing cars, you can save your money by public transportation, not paying for a car insurance, and not paying for a car in general. Not getting a car may seem strange as you need to get to location A and B. But in Vauban, Germany cars are not allowed and they seem to be doing just fine. Reports say "Vauban, home to 5,500 residents [within a rectangular square mile] may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life". Even though they aren't aloud personal cars, they can walk, bike, or take a tram anywhere they need to go! Also in most parts of America they now have car-pooling apps, public transportation, and shared vans! So instead of paying huge amounts of money for gas, a car, and car insurance, why not just tag along for a ride or get some excersize!  As you watch somebody drive off, dont you worry about their saftey? Every year there are more percentages of deaths and injuries in cars then there is in any other motor accident. We can prevent drunk driving, car crashes, and the amount of injures and deaths by reducing cars. I hate hearing those unbearable stories about teenagers getting behind the wheel under the influence causing crazy car wrecks. To avoid that we can allow public transportation, removing any crashes and improving the saftey of our generation. Also, the traffic jams that make people stressful and angry increase the crash rates as aggresive driving is very dangerous. To prevent that we can just walk, allowing us to enjoy our clean air and get excersize.  In conclusion, cars have changed our way of life for the good and the bad. Even though they help us get to our destination, they affect our enviornment, our money, and our saftey. If we reduce the amount of cars driven we can help our enviornment by lowering the rate of greenhouse gases, pollution, and carbon emissions. Also we save tons of money as we dont spend thousands of dollars on cars, and their needs. And finally, reducing cars saves tons of lifes as drunk driving and car crashes are avoided allowing the death and injury rates to decrease. So next time you're walking down the street, think about how your community would be without these machienes.    		0
For students considering graduating high school in less than the traditional four year time frame, there are several advantages and disadvantages of that choice to consider. The most significant advantage is cost savings; students can save up to half a year's tuition by graduating in three years compared to four. Graduating early also allows for increased college course work in the remaining time, giving students the opportunity to impress college admissions offices.   On the other hand, although graduating early will help save money, students who choose this route may not have had the opportunity to take as many classes as those who completed the traditional four years. When it comes to college preparedness, this is an important factor to consider. Additionally, graduating in three years may leave students feeling as though they are missing out on a major part of their high school experience in the form of sports teams, clubs, and other activities.  In my opinion, students should weigh the advantages and disadvantages of graduating early before making the decision to do so. Graduating early can be beneficial depending on the individual's goals and needs. It may be easier to get ahead in college preparedness through a three year plan, while maintaining the full high school experience and taking all the available classes may be the best fit for others. Ultimately, the decision is a personal one and should be taken into consideration with care.		1
 When it comes to exploring the vast expanse of space, Mars has always been a point of great interest for scientists and space enthusiasts alike due to its similarity with Earth and its potential to support life. However, one of the most intriguing phenomena on the red planet is the face that has been observed from orbit and is known as the "Face on Mars."  This natural formation has been visible for centuries, but it was not until the 20th century that scientists were able to get a more detailed understanding of its origins and composition. The Face on Mars is believed to be a large, ancient canyon system that has been eroded over time by the action of wind and water.  What makes the Face on Mars so fascinating is the way in which it seems to resemble a face, with its sinuous curves, deep crevices, and rounded features. Some scientists have even gone so far as to suggest that the formation may be the result of an extinct Martian civilization, with the shapes and patterns supposedly representing the features of some alien being.  Despite the many theories that have been put forward, no one knows for sure what caused the formation of the Face on Mars. Some scientists suggest that it may be the result of a massive volcanic eruption or the impact of a large meteorite, while others think that it may have been shaped by the action of rivers and lakes that flowed across the planet's surface millions of years ago.  What is clear, however, is that the Face on Mars is a remarkable testament to the forces of nature and the incredible variety of landscapes that can be found across the solar system. Whether it was formed by the work of an extinct Martian civilization or by the action of geological processes, the Face on Mars is an enigma that continues to intrigue and fascinate scientists and space enthusiasts alike.  In conclusion, the Face on Mars is an enduring mystery that has captured the imagination of people for centuries. While scientists have made some progress in understanding its origins and composition, the true nature of this remarkable formation remains unknown. Whatever it is, one thing is certain - the Face on Mars is a testament to the incredible diversity of landscapes and processes that can be found across the solar system, and a reminder of the limitless potential for exploration and discovery that lies within our reach.		1
 Facial Action Coding System (FACS)    Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a method of scientific analysis of facial expression that was originally developed by Paul Ekman, Wallace V. Friesen, and Wallace S. Musa in the early 1970s. FACS is a highly detailed and systematic way of evaluating and categorizing facial movements during expression. The system is based on the idea that facial expressions are encoded as different patterns of muscle activation in the face, and that these patterns can be measured and analyzed scientifically.  FACS uses a combination of cameras, sensors, and computer software to record and analyze facial expression. The system is highly complex, with over 70 muscle groups in the face, each of which is capable of producing a wide range of movements. FACS researchers use this detail to break down facial expressions into smaller and more precise components, allowing for a more complete understanding of how the face is used to communicate emotions and other social cues.  One of the primary uses of FACS is in the field of emotion research. By analyzing the muscle movements of subjects while they are expressing various emotions, FACS researchers can identify specific patterns of activity that are associated with different emotional states. This information can then be used to develop more accurate models of emotion and to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying emotional processing.  FACS is also widely used in the field of forensic science for the identification of individuals based on their facial expressions. By recording and comparing the muscle patterns of different individuals during various facial expressions, FACS can help investigators identify suspects or determine the identity of victims based on their physical appearance.  In conclusion, Facial Action Coding System is a highly sophisticated method of scientific analysis that has revolutionized our understanding of facial expression. By breaking down facial expressions into smaller and more precise components, FACS has allowed researchers to identify specific patterns of activity that are associated with different emotional states and physical expressions. This information has a wide range of practical applications, from the study of emotion to forensic science, and will undoubtedly continue to generate new insights into this fascinating area of human behavior and communication.		1
Phones and Driving  Imagine if someone sends a text to a relative then they die because they were texting while driving. Texting while driving is a huge distraction can cause may accidents. A text is not more important than a life. Texting can wait once a person starts texting they are distracted from the road not only putting their own life at risk but others too. Texting and driving is bad it can ruin lives, its distracting, texting can also wait.  Texting distracts from the road when someone's focus is on something else it makes doing the task more difficult. Causing accidents that may result in the loss of life for the driver or anyone affected. Distracted driving is looked down upon by other cars. Other drivers know there could be an accident involving them if there is someone texting and driving that may result in thel lose money and time possibly loss of time.  Responding to a text while driving is not that important compared to the possible loss of life. This is why there are laws that prevent people from texting a driving which will result in a fin. Most people will probably choose living over texting because a human life is worth more than a response to someone's text. There are some people who have lost their life due to texting and driving. Now there familys are missing out of the time they could have spent with them if they were still living.  Texting can wait, yes you may have to respond to a text but it is more important than a life. Iphones are now coming with a feature to prevent people from texting and driving, for example if they do have there phone in there hand they have to agree that they are not texting and driving before opening the phone up. There is also a feature that will auto respond to text messages saying that the person is currently driving and can not respond. The last feature is that they would not receive the notification until there not driving, that makes it easier to forget about responding so not to be pressured.  Texting and driving is really bad and should not be done. Texting and driving is distracting and would cause you to have an accident. Responding to someone's text is not as important than someone's life. Finally responding to a text can wait and can be prevented because a life is worth more than a response to your friends and family. Laws are created for a reason texting and driving is no acception.         		0
Can a computer recognize the subtke facial movements we humans use to express how we feel? This text is explaining how technology is identifying humans facial expressions and if it is valuable or not.  The use of technology to read emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuble because in the text it states, "Infact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect. Dr. Huang new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps his emotion algorithms are a different sort of "Da Vinci Code"! The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you are happy or sad. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." Based on all of this information, this is basicaly telling me all the benefits this new software computer can do. In my own personal opinion, I think it would be a great idea to have software like these to have at school. Ideas like this one could actually end up helping a very long way.  In conclusion, a software identifying human emotions is a great idea to bring into this world. Throughout all of the sadness, the happieness, and all of the aggressiveness, it could help people a long way.		0
Cell phones have become invaluable tools, especially for students. While cell phones offer many advantages, there are some potential drawbacks to using them in the classroom for educational purposes.  On the positive side, cell phones can be used to help students keep up with course work and class notes. Not only do they provide a convenient way to take notes, but they can also be used to access educational websites, virtual classrooms, and online videos and articles. Additionally, cell phones can be used for communication purposes, such as group collaboration on group projects or critical discussions of course material.  Despite the potential advantages, there are also some potential drawbacks to using cell phones in the classroom. For instance, students may be distracted by their phones, leading to a decrease in information retention and overall learning. Additionally, if cell phones aren‚Äôt used correctly, it could potentially lead to decreased grades. Proper responding to emails and texting in the classroom must be monitored to ensure cell phone use will be productive and not a distraction.  Overall, the use of cell phones in the classroom should not be discouraged, but instead should be used with caution and structure. When used correctly, cell phones offer an effective tool for students to access course information and engage in meaningful discussions. However, it is important to be mindful of how cell phone use can negatively affect student grades if not used properly.		1
Schools should allow student-designed summer projects instead of teacher-designed projects. There are a few key reasons for this.   First, student-designed projects will generate more interest and motivation from students. When students have autonomy in choosing their own summer learning activity, they are more likely to pick a topic that truly interests them. This makes it more enjoyable to work on over the summer break when students want to relax. Teacher-designed projects risk feeling like more required schoolwork, taking away from the freedom of summer.   Second, student-designed projects encourage independence, creativity and responsibility. By letting students choose their own projects, it teaches important life skills. Students have to think for themselves about what they want to learn more about. They have to come up with a creative idea and a plan to complete it. Being responsible for their own project over the summer builds self-reliance.   Finally, student-designed projects can be more tailored to individual interests. Teachers do not know each student's unique passions and hobbies as well as the students know themselves. By choosing topics they genuinely care about, students will get more out of the learning process. They can explore areas the regular curriculum does not reach. This makes learning more personalized and meaningful for each student.   In conclusion, schools should implement student-designed summer projects rather than teacher-assigned work. It fosters independence, motivation and learning tailored to each student's interests. By giving students autonomy over their break assignments, it enhances the learning experience and better prepares them for life beyond school. Summer is a time for students to pursue knowledge in their own way.		1
 When faced with a problem, do you ever consider the potential benefits of approaching it with a positive attitude and a willingness to put in the effort to solve it? Jazz legend Duke Ellington once said, "A problem is a chance for you to do your best." In my opinion, this quote holds a great deal of wisdom and relevance in today's world.  Firstly, if you don't approach a problem with a sense of purpose and determination, you may end up feeling regretful about your decision. For example, imagine a student who didn't put in the effort to study for an exam and ended up failing. This experience could have been avoided if the student had approached the problem with a sense of urgency and a willingness to put in the necessary work.  Secondly, approaching a problem with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn can lead to new discoveries and insights. By putting in the effort to understand a problem, you may discover new ways to approach it or even find solutions you never thought possible. For instance, a person who has been struggling with a particular health issue may discover a new treatment option by approaching the problem with an open mind and a willingness to learn.  Lastly, if you don't approach a problem with a sense of purpose and a willingness to learn, you may end up repeating the same mistakes over and over again. For example, a person who has been struggling with a particular relationship issue may continue to repeat the same mistakes if they don't approach the problem with a sense of purpose and a willingness to learn. By approaching the problem with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn, you can break the cycle of repeating the same mistakes and start making progress towards a better outcome.  In conclusion, I believe that Duke Ellington's quote holds a great deal of wisdom and relevance in today's world. By approaching a problem with a sense of purpose and a willingness to learn, you can avoid regrets, discover new insights, and break the cycle of repeating the same mistakes. So, the next time you face a problem, remember that it's a chance for you to do your best and make progress towards a better outcome.		1

Here is a summary of the main points:  Claim: Limiting car usage can help reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, which are harmful to the environment and human health.  Evidence: According to the passage, Paris banned cars for five days due to smog, which resulted in a 60% reduction in congestion. Additionally, Bogota, Colombia, has seen a significant decrease in air pollution since it introduced a car-free day, with more people turning to alternative modes of transportation such as biking and public transit.  Counterclaim: Some may argue that limiting car usage is unrealistic or unreasonable, as cars are a convenient mode of transportation for many people.  Evidence: The passage notes that the turnout for car-free days in Bogota and Paris was large despite rain showers, indicating that people are willing to participate in these events. Additionally, new technologies such as car-sharing programs and bike-sharing services are becoming more popular, providing alternative modes of transportation that are more environmentally friendly.  Claim: Limiting car usage can also lead to mental and physical health benefits, as people are more likely to engage in physical activity and breathe cleaner air.  Evidence: The passage cites a study that found that young people are less interested in buying cars, and instead prefer to use alternative modes of transportation such as public transit or biking. This shift towards more environmentally friendly transportation can lead to reduced stress levels and improved overall health.  In conclusion, the evidence presented in the passage suggests that limiting car usage can have numerous benefits for the environment, human health, and quality of life. While some may argue that limiting car usage is		1
 As the world becomes increasingly aware of the importance of environmental sustainability, many cities are considering implementing car-free policies to improve air quality and reduce their carbon footprint. In this essay, we will examine the benefits and drawbacks of car-free cities and explore some potential solutions for cities that want to reduce their dependence on cars while still providing their citizens with convenient transportation options.  Car-free cities, as the name suggests, are cities where cars are not allowed to drive within their limits. This can include buses, trucks, and motorcycles, depending on the specific policies of the city. The main benefit of car-free cities is that they significantly reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This is because cars are one of the largest sources of air pollution in urban areas, and preventing them from entering the city reduces the amount of emissions that are released into the atmosphere.  Car-free cities also offer a number of economic benefits. For one, they can help reduce traffic congestion, leading to shorter commute times and fewer sick days due to respiratory problems caused by exposure to polluted air. This can result in reduced healthcare costs, increased productivity, and overall economic growth for the city. Additionally, car-free cities can help increase tourism, as visitors who are looking for an eco-friendly vacation may be more likely to visit a city with a strong commitment to sustainability.  Despite these benefits, car-free cities also have potential drawbacks. One major concern is that the lack of cars may result in a decrease in economic activity, as businesses that rely on automobile access may be forced to relocate outside the city or lose customers. Additionally, the shift away from cars may require significant investments in alternative transportation options, such as public transit, bike lanes, and pedestrian walkways. These investments may not see immediate ROI, leading to frustration and concerns about the cost-effectiveness of the new policies.  In order to successfully implement car-free policies, cities will need to carefully consider their options and weigh the benefits and drawbacks. Some potential solutions include phasing in the restrictions gradually over time, allowing businesses that cannot adapt to the new policies to remain in the city, and investing in alternative transportation options that are tailored to the specific needs of the city. Additionally, city planners may need to consider the logistics of implementing car-free policies, such as the need for parking spaces and how to transport goods and services within the city.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a number of benefits, but also have potential drawbacks. By carefully considering these factors, cities can implement sustainable transportation policies that balance economic growth with environmental protection. Ultimately, the goal should be		1

Phones and Driving  Over 400,000 casualties occur annually due to distractions while driving (Vegega, pg 3). Many of these distractions are due to phones, an ever-growing distraction for drivers. Due to this risk drivers should not be able to use phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because of the growing threat towards drivers and pedestrians and potential cost of damages.  Since recent years phones have been a more common distraction for drivers. Growing distractions such as the usage of cellular devices poses a threat to drivers. From 2012 to 2015 crashes involving cell phones have increased by 15% from roughly 60,000 to 69,000 (NHTSA, pg 3). Therefore the usage of cellular devices while driving has led to a growing threat for drivers. Furthermore, distractions while driving also poses a risk to pedestrians. Of the 3450 fatalities in the US during 2016 caused by car crashes due to distractions 462 (13%) are pedestrians (NHTSA, pg 3). This means distractions such as cell phone usage put pedestrians at serious risk when a car crash occurs. Overall, cell phone usage while driving poses a growing danger toward drivers and pedestrians.  Phone usage while driving can cost vast amounts for both governments and drivers. Damaged caused by crashes due to distractions is expensive to replace or repair. In 2010 the cost of damage due to distracted drivers was $22 billion, which is about $26 billion in 2019 (Vegega, pg 3). This data reveals that car crashes due to distractions cost countries billions to remedy, an expense which far outweigh any positives. In addition, drivers also risk paying fines for cell phone usage. In states such as Delaware fines can cost upwards of $50 and come with court fees upwards of $100 (Chaudhary, pg 3). This means that drivers can face severe financial penalties due to cell phone usage while driving. In brief, the financial cost of crashes due to distractions far outweigh the benefits of cell phone use.  In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use phones in capacity while operating a vehicle due to the risk towards drivers and pedestrians and enormous financial cost. While driving, drivers are exposed to many types of distraction however, distractions such as phones are in complete control of the driver.  Works Cited  Chaudhary, N.

Sure, here's my essay response:  Impression: The Power of How We Present Ourselves  Impression is a powerful tool that we all possess, and it plays a significant role in how we present ourselves to the world. Our attitude and behavior can greatly impact the way others perceive us, and it is important to understand the significance of this concept. As an 8th grader, I have learned that impression is not just about how we look, but also about how we act and carry ourselves.  Research has shown that celebrities and prominent people use their impression to create an impact. For example, when a famous actor or actress walks the red carpet, they are not just showing off their latest fashion trends, but they are also projecting a certain image or persona that they want to be associated with. This is done intentionally to create a lasting impression on their fans and the media. Similarly, politicians use their impression to win over voters and gain their support.  However, it is not just celebrities and politicians who can use their impression to create an impact. As individuals, we also have the power to use our impression to make a positive difference in the world. For instance, when we volunteer in our community, we are not just helping others, but we are also projecting a positive image of ourselves. Our impression can be a tool or gift that we can use to inspire others and make a positive change.  But, it is important to remember that our impression can also be damaged by our behavior. If we act in a way that is inconsistent with our values or image, it can lead to a negative perception of ourselves. For example, if we claim to be an advocate for social justice, but we are seen behaving in a discriminatory or unjust manner, it can greatly damage our reputation and credibility. Therefore, it is crucial that we are mindful of our actions and ensure that they align with our image and values.  In conclusion, impression is a powerful tool that we all possess, and it is important to understand how it can be used to create a positive impact. By being mindful of our attitude and behavior, we can ensure that our impression is not damaged by our actions. Instead, we can use it as a tool to inspire others and make a positive difference		1
 When we picture cowboys, we often imagine them tending to cattle on a vast ranch or roping offenders in a Western movie. However, there's much more to cowboys than meets the eye. One such cowboy who defied the stereotypes and ventured into deep water was Kelly Slater, who became the first professional surfer from Hawaii in 1995. Slater's journey from a humble background in Oahu's Waikiki surf beach to being regarded as one of the greatest surfers in history exemplifies the spirit of innovation and courage that defines true cowboys.  Slater's grandfather played a pivotal role in his love for the waves. As a young boy, he would sit on his grandfather's lap while watching the surf break in Waikiki's Pipeline. Those early experiences ignited a passion that would become a defining force in Slater's life. However, it wasn't until the legendary Hawaiian surfer Duke Kahanamoku spotted his talent at the age of five that he truly began to pursue surfing.  Slater quickly emerged as one of the most dominant surfers in the professional circuit, winning an unprecedented 11 World Surf League championships. His success was the result of a combination of skills, discipline, and an unwavering determination to become the best. He spent countless hours training on different wave sizes and conditions, perfecting his technique and studying the ocean's behavior to gain an edge over his competition.  In addition to his skill on the waves, Slater exhibits a true cowboy spirit of independence and self-reliance. He travels the world in search of new breaks, often sleeping under the stars and relying on his wits and intuition to navigate the rough terrain. This self-sufficiency has not only allowed him to become one of the most successful surfers of all time but has also made him an inspiration to aspiring surfers worldwide.  Slater's accomplishments extend beyond the water, as he works tirelessly to promote environmental activism and support disaster relief efforts. He founded the Kelly Slater Foundation in 1994, which supports children's causes in Hawaii and around the world. In addition, he is a vocal advocate for ocean conservation and has worked with various organizations to promote sustainable surfing practices and educate communities on the importance of protecting our oceans.  In conclusion, Kelly Slater's accomplishments as a surfer, environmentalist, and compassionate humanitarian make him a true embodiment of the cowboy spirit. His tenacity and unwavering pursuit of excellence have elevated him to the status of one of the greatest surfers in history, while his dedication to giving back to his community highlights the importance of giving back to those in need. As we honor the legacy of the cowboy, let us also recognize the courage and innovation required by individuals like Kelly Slater to push the boundaries and inspire future generations.		1
When we're having difficulty deciding what to do,we turn to someone in hopes of them giving us advice. For example, when you're at a resturant and you don't know what to get, you ask somebody else what they believe is a good option. Sometimes, you may even ask more than one person. Asking for more opinions from different people can lead to better choices. When asking for advice, think about the type of person they are, what kind of experience they had, and what option would be best for you.  There are many different types of people in this world. Some can be quiet and introverted; others can be loud and outgoing. When you're taking advice from somebody, consider: their personality, what they like, and what they don't like. Imagine you're deciding whether or not to go to a concert. If you ask someone who doesn't like them if you should go or not, they're most likely tell you no. If you ask someone who likes concerts, they're more likely to say yes. What they belive you should do all depends on what type of person they are and what they'd personally enjoy.  Last summer, my mom signed my brothers up for a summer camp. One enjoyed it because his friends were in the same group as him. However, my other brother hated it because he didn't like the people he was grouped with.  When I asked if I should go, if it would be fun, only one said yes. The different experiences they both had made them have different opinions about the camp as a whole.  Lastly, when asking for advice, the most important thing is to ask yourself is, "Is this something I actually want to do?" When considering your options, it all comes down to choosing what's right for you. Sometimes, asking multiple people for their opinion can leave you confused and even more frustrated than before. If you get to this point, think about the pros and cons of each choice. Decide whether or not it's the best option or if there's a better one for you.  All in all, hearing opinions from multiple people can help you make a better choice because it helps you narrow down the pros and cons. Everyone is a different person and everyone has different experiences. Getting advice from many people is an important part in problem-solving. It helps you find solutions to minor problems- like what to eat for dinner, and it can help you find solutions to greater problems- whether you should move houses or not. Sure, hearing advice from many people can be frustrasting, but it can also change your life for the better.		0
My principal has decided to make a rule to where all students must participate in a extracurricular activity.  I agree they should, the students can join a student council.  They can get more involved in school, they can make their selves¬†more known in school, and it can be better later in life.  If going by the better later in life example, it will look good on college and job applications.  If the students were to get in a extracurricular activity, student council for example, they would get more involved in school.  They would know all thats going on in their school. Students could help out their peers if they need to know something important.  They can also help in school fundraisers or maybe if the school helps out Children Hospitals or homeless shelters they can help out them as well.  Getting more known is also a plus for some people.  It gives the students more opportunities to do things for their school and outside of their school.  If more teachers know about the students and all they do for their school they would most likely recognize those students. Outside of school you could also get well known for do the right things an helping out people and being that person that everybody should be to help out.  Joining a extracurricular activity can also be better for the students later in life.  College applications is a good example, if you want to go to a certain college then you need the grades for it and if they see that you have been in a extracurricular activity then they will look at you a little more.  Another one is job applications, it's the same as the college applications almost.  When you apply for a job and they take your job application and they see that you have participated in a activity like student council they will want you to be there because they want somebody who will be a leader and not be a follower.  Joining a extracurricular activity can be beneficial.  So I agree with my principal on making a rule where the students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. The principal is trying to help their students out if they take their advice they can go a long way in life. They can get into their favorite college and get their dream job.  So just take your principals advice they are really trying to help you out.   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
Dear Principal,  I firmly believe that all students should be required to perform community service. The act of serving others helps individuals learn how to be compassionate, caring, and better citizens. Many students already, have contributed to the community by tutoring elementary students and participating in local trash clean-ups. However, some students believe that community service is a waste of time. So, I am going to inform you that it is not.  Tutoring younger students is an example of community service that helps people, other than ourselves. It helps younger students with their homework or questions, and it provides a role model in their life. If a younger student was taught by a person they looked up to then, when that child grew up, they could do the same. They would tutor younger kids just like their role model. This is a positive act, because, their would me more educated kids in our community.  Another community service is trash clean-ups. They may not sound like fun, but they help keep the community clean and beautiful. If more kids in our school picked up a piece of trash in our school or the whole community, the world would be a little cleaner. Cleaning is not that hard either, but kids have to be motivated and with the requirement of community service, they would be.  This whole letter is to try to convince you to try to make that requirement of community service, but it wouldn't be fair if i only showed you one side of the story. A lot of kids would rather be playing video games or watching t. v. in their spare time, but community service does not take a lot of time. Picking up trash in the halls in between classes , or answering a question is considered community service. It only takes a minute! If you make community service a requirement then, we would see more good deeds every day. The community would be a better place and we students, will become better everyday citizens.		0
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:  Title: Inspired to Make a Change  As I sat in my history class, listening to my teacher talk about the civil rights movement, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and admiration for the brave individuals who fought for equality and justice. Their stories of resilience and determination inspired me to make a change in my own life.  I couldn't help but think of my own experiences and how I could make a difference. Growing up, I had always been aware of the racial tensions in my community, but I never really knew how to address them. I had always felt like an outsider, like I didn't quite belong. But after learning about the struggles of those who came before me, I realized that I had the power to make a difference.  I started small, by speaking up when I witnessed racist behavior and educating my friends and family about the importance of inclusivity and respect. It wasn't easy, and there were definitely times when I felt like giving up. But every time I heard a success story of someone who had stood up for what was right, no matter the cost, I felt a surge of determination.  One person who really stood out to me was Rosa Parks. Her courage and conviction in the face of oppression inspired me to take a stand, even when it was hard. I realized that I didn't have to be a leader or a hero to make a difference, I just had to be willing to listen and learn.  Learning about the experiences of others has inspired me to make a change in my own life. I've learned that even the smallest actions can have a big impact, and that standing up for what is right is always worth it. I may not be able to single-handedly change the world, but I can definitely make a difference in my own community. And who knows, maybe one day I'll be the one inspiring others to make a change.		1
In an age were technology is advancing by the year, many school districts offer different types of learning depending on the type of school. Students of these districts has a choice of attending school virtually from home or being in the actual school. Students can benefit from being able to attend classes from home rather then being there physically.  To start off, being able to attend virtually from home can help with ones' schedule to become more flexible. For example, If one has a doctor appointment at 10:55 but their class is at 9 and and goes for 50 minutes, one can finish her class and start on any homework before needing to go to ones' doctors appointment. This can greatly benefit not just the student but the parents as well because the parent can schedule an early appointment but not having to miss and instructional time. Also, a parent can have a stress free schedule. Ones' parent can schedule their appointment on the same day as ones' other sibling's appointment, so it will be stress free for their parent's schedule. This may be a huge benefit for some parents because if they have multiple children and they do sports and/or any grouping activities, they may not have enough time to schedule doctor appointments or go to the dentist due to not wanting their children to fall behind and miss a lesson which can lead to their children not going to the doctor or the dentist as much as they need to go and can harm their health.  Second of all, The parents can set how fast they want their student to learn and if they want it to be year round or not. Some parents may want to go on an vacation but they don't want their student to miss any instructional time and fall behind. That is why being able to have online classes is a better choice then attending school because their student is able to keep on learning from the vacation spot and being able to not fall behind as their fellow classmate. In additionally, If ones' student falls behind of the classwork and isn't completely understanding of what their doing, they can slow down the speed of what their learning and go on their own pace.¬†This can benefit the school because it can increase the test scores, it can give the student access to more one on one time with their teacher and it can make sure the the student is 100% understanding the work.  Many may argue that students may not be actually attending these classes or may cheat their way through school, but as technology advances so will schools and how they catch students cheating on a test or an essay. Also the parent will get a weekly report on their students progress through out the school to in sure¬†that students are doing what they need to get done. Also they may say that some students may not have an access to technology or they may not be able to do online school. Even though these school districts are offering online schooling for their students, their still able to go to a regular school and have a fixed schedule, instead of having online school.  Thus, as technology advances in schools, Students benefit from attending school from their house instead of going into an actual school because ones' schedule can become more flexible, a parent can have a stress free schedule, the parents can set how fast they want their student to learn and if they want it to be year round or not and they can slow down the speed of what their learning and go on their own pace.		0
 Facial action coding system, commonly known as FACS, is an analytical tool used in psychology and other scientific fields to study and analyze human facial expressions. It was first introduced by Paul Ekman, Wallace V. Friesen, and Wallace A. Maibach in a pioneering book titled "Handbook of Facial Expressions" in 1972. The system is based on the idea that each facial expression has its unique set of muscle movements, which can be used to accurately categorize and analyze these expressions.  FACS is a standardized technique that involves coding specific facial movements associated with various emotions, behaviors, and social cues. The system includes 46 distinct action units, each of which corresponds to a specific facial movement. These units are grouped into eight categories, based on the direction of the movement: eye movements, lip movements, head movements, jaw movements, brow movements, eyelid movements, glottal movements, and facial gesture movements. The system also includes a subsystem known as "micro-expression," which deals with very brief and subtle facial expressions that are often missed by the naked eye.  FACS has been widely used in various fields, including psychopathology, medicine, anthropology, and marketing. In psychology, it has been used to study affective processing, emotion regulation, and cultural variations in emotional expression. In medicine, it has been used to monitor patients' emotional status, detect pain, and study neurological disorders. In anthropology, it has been used to study cross-cultural differences in nonverbal communication and social behavior. In marketing, it has been used to study consumers' reactions to advertisements and product design.  The FACS system has several advantages. It is standardized, objective, and replicable, making it a reliable tool for studying and analyzing facial expressions. It allows for the detailed analysis of both macro-expressions (such as smiling, frowning, or angry expressions) and micro-expressions (such as small lip curls or subtle eye movements), providing a comprehensive understanding of emotional and social cues. It is also applicable to different cultures and contexts, making it a valuable tool for studying cross-cultural differences.  However, there are also some limitations to the FACS system. It relies on visual observations, which can be subjective and prone to error. It may not be able to capture the nuances and complexities of human communication, as facial expressions are just one aspect of nonverbal communication. Its use may also raise ethical concerns, as it may be perceived as invasive or manipulative by some individuals.  In conclusion, the facial action coding system is a powerful tool for studying and analyzing human facial expressions. It provides a standardized, objective, and replicable approach to understanding emotional and social cues, and has been widely used in various fields. While it may have some limitations, its ability to capture the nuances and complexities of human communication makes it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the study of nonverbal communication and behavior.		1
Summer is a students time to relax and take a long break from the chaos that endures during the school year. This break is normally for beach trips and days at the pool with ones friends. Although, some schools make students complete projects over the summer to make sure they stay sharp and are prepared for the more difficult school year that lies ahead of them. These projects will either be designed by students or by a faculty member of the school district. These summer projects, most likely an already unwanted assignment, should be designed by the students for reasons that will make a difference in the long run of the students education like, students know students best, keeping work balanced, and getting rid of unnecessary work.  The first reason students should be the creators of these projects is because students know students best. When a teacher designs a projects sometimes they do not always know how kids will respond to the assignment and how that will effect what they are learning. For example if a student is excited for a project they are going to be more willing to finish it and will be more excited to learn about the material it is on, and students know what they like best and are able to create these assignments that will work in their benefit and will make them enthusiastic about what they are doing. Which in turn will make the project more effective towards their education and will end up helping the teachers. All in all, students know what they like best.  Another issue is with facility giving out these projects is they can sometimes overdue what they are giving out. This meaning students will be able to give out a balanced schedule for the other students to complete. For example they will have a set amount of work for two weeks and they will have deadlines within the break. This is not saying teachers cannot do this but students will be able to provide a fair amount of work for the others to do without the students feeling like they have too much to do over a short period of time. This will also in turn¬†make the projects easier to digest for students and not overwhelm them when the time comes for them to start it.  The final reason it would be better for students to create this projects is because a lot of the time students feel that teachers give out work that is not necessary. I have seen this happen all of the time, teachers give out work that does not feel like it is helping with out education but there just to keep us busy or "busy work". The elimination of this work would be very beneficial to not only our time but our feelings toward the project and our eagerness to finish it. If we feel like we are doing work that does not benefit us in any way it does not make us enthusiastic about what we are doing and will only make us go into the school year feeling hostile that the teachers made us do that work. If students were creating the projects they would be able to almost eliminate this work entirely and keep it to only what we need to do. If a student feels they need more practice on a certain topic they would be able to provide that practice option without having everyone else do it if they do not need the practice.  In conclusion, if students were able to create these projects they would be able to reach the other students in a way that a facility¬†member would not. Once again, students know students best. With students making these projects we would be able to change the feeling toward doing school work in the summer from a negative¬†to possibly even a positive if done correctly. These summer projects, most likely an already unwanted assignment, should be designed by the students for reasons that will make a difference in the long run of the students education like, students know¬†students¬†best, keeping work¬†balanced, and getting rid of unnecessary work. By the students, for the students.		0
 The electoral college has been a fundamental part of the United States electoral system since the foundation of the country, but in recent years, the topic of whether it works or not has come under scrutiny. Some argue that it is a fair and necessary system, while others contend that it is outdated and needs to be abolished. In my opinion, the electoral college does work in its intended capacity, but there are some issues that need to be addressed in order to improve the electoral process.  The electoral college is designed to ensure that every citizen's vote is counted, by allotting a certain number of electoral votes to each state based on its population. This ensures that smaller states have the same influence in the elections as larger states, which is important in maintaining a fair and balanced government. The fact that the winner of the popular vote does not always become the president also helps to prevent the tyranny of the majority, as it provides a check and balance for the states with different demographics and interests.   However, there are some criticisms of the electoral college system that are worth considering. One of the main criticisms is that it can be skewed by gerrymandering, which is the practice of manipulating the boundaries of electoral districts in order to favor one political party or another. If electoral districts are not drawn in a fair and unbiased manner, it can distort the democratic process, leading to an imbalanced government.   Another criticism of the electoral college is that it can result in candidates ignoring certain states in favor of others. This is because some states have a disproportionate number of electoral votes, meaning that winning them can have a big impact on the election outcome. As a result, candidates may focus their campaigns on states that they believe will be more receptive to their message, leaving other states underserved. This can create a situation in which certain voices are not heard, and the democratic process is not truly representative.  In my opinion, these issues can be addressed through reform, rather than abolition. For example, one solution to gerrymandering could be to require states to draw electoral district boundaries in a manner that is independent of political parties. This would help to ensure that electoral districts are drawn in a way that is fair and unbiased. Additionally, some people have proposed implementing national ranked-choice voting, which would give voters the option to rank their candidates in order of preference. This could help to prevent candidates from ignoring certain states, as it would allow them to win by earning second- and third-choice votes from voters in those states.  In conclusion, the electoral college system has its strengths and weaknesses. While it is designed to ensure that every citizen's vote is counted and to prevent the tyranny of the majority, it can be skewed by gerrymandering and result in certain voices being ignored. However, these issues can be addressed through reform, rather than abolition. By implementing fair and unbiased electoral district boundaries and national ranked-choice voting, we can help to ensure that the		1
 Facial action coding system (FACS) is a method of measuring and classifying human facial movements. It was developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a tool for studying nonverbal communication, particularly emotions, in humans. This system has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly due to its potential uses in areas such as lie detection and emotion recognition.  The FACS system is based on a standardized coding system of facial movements that are thought to be universal across cultures and languages. These movements are measured using electromyogram (EMG) signals that record the electrical activity of muscles in the face. The EMG signals are then analyzed to determine the specific facial movements that are occurring, and these movements are classified into different categories, such as eye blinking, lip movement, and head movement.  The FACS system has been used in various studies to investigate nonverbal communication and to discriminate between different emotions and attitudes. For example, researchers have found that people display different facial expressions when they are happy, sad, angry, surprised, or disgusted. Moreover, studies have shown that these facial expressions can be used to predict people's behavior and attitudes, such as purchasing behavior, job performance, and political preferences.  The potential applications of the FACS system are numerous and diverse. For instance, the system can be used to enhance lie detection techniques by analyzing microexpressions that people may not be aware of expressing. Furthermore, the system can be used to develop more accurate and reliable emotion recognition technology, which has important implications for fields such as mental health, marketing, and robotics.  However, the FACS system is not free from criticism, and several concerns have been raised about its validity and reliability. For example, some argue that the system may not be appropriate for some cultures and populations, as cultural differences can affect nonverbal communication. Additionally, some researchers have questioned the accuracy of the system, as facial movements can be ambiguous and subject to interpretation.  In conclusion, the FACS system is a powerful tool for studying nonverbal communication and emotion recognition. While its potential applications are significant, there are concerns about its validity and reliability that need to be addressed. Further research is needed to refine the system and ensure that it is appropriate for different populations and cultures. Overall, the FACS system has great potential as a tool for studying human behavior and emotions, and its continued development and refinement will likely lead to new and exciting applications.		1
The author supports that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers represents. Venus is a planet closest to Earth. It's conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth. Venus may be the most Earth-like plannet in our solar system. Venus has more characteristics than Earth does.  Veus conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in our solar system. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. It is crazy imaging Venus having way more pressure than Earth. The text sasy, "Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupying volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes." This shows that Venus has many powerful climate changes. The author states this becaue, he wants to inform us how dangers Venus can be, but yet so interesting and gives readers want to know more of it.  According to the article, Venus may be the most Earth- like plannet in our solar system. The text says, "Often referred to as Earth's twin." Venus is closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. This shows that people may know Venus as a different version as Earth. This relates that the author supports the idea of studying Venus is worthy because it is very similar to Earth, so why not study it and explore it? The author may think that Venus can be somewhere people can survive in and look more forward to.  Venus has way more characteristics than Earth does. The author stated how it is the hottest surface temperature, more powerful climate cahnges, more atmospheric pressure, etc. Venus is a unique planet. The author want us to invest more to Venus, because it has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.  Venus has dangers it despites, but can be so interesting to invest more on. The author thinks Venus may be the most earth-like plannet in our system. It is like Earth's 'twin'. So, if it's similar to Earth, why not look more forward to studying Venus. It is important to know what's surrounded in Earth.   		0

A letter to my principle  I think students shouldn't have cells phones at school because its an distraction to all of the students. But it will be different if the students were just a little quiet with the cell phones, but instead they decide to bring DRAMA to the schools. Cell phones are the number one reason why fights are getting started at schools around the country. If they didn't have cell phones the percentage of fighting and arguing will be decreased.  Also ,there's another reason I think they should ban the cell phones because if we were to use our cell phones in class the only thing that would happen is that no one will learn anything but how to TALK on the cell phone, and how to TEXT on the cell phones and that's mainly the problem that we are still having to today.  Next, is the drama it causes sometimes it can ruin an friend ship or even a marriage it can be that serious. But to lose an husband or an wife a family mmbe an best friend over some stuff like that is really childish and it needs to STOP before it gets out of hand. So that's it for WHY I THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE CELL PHONES AT SCHOOL !		0
Dear Principal,  Changing the school policy to only letting students attend or play sports is good but bad at the same time, it can be good because you should keep up with your school work while your playing sports or other activities. That is the main reason why you are going to school. If you cannot somehow keep up with any of your school work and your getting D' s and F' s then you shouldn't be playing any sports or be in any activities for the week or that period of time. But having as C average and not being able to play sports i think is unreasonable. So having that policy is a good thing. But it can be bad at a certain point because having to have at least a B average is kind of high. I think at least having a C average is pretty reasonable than having to have a B average. If the policy was having to have at least a B average to play any sports or other activities i wouldn't join any of them.		0
Research has shown that there are numerous benefits to providing healthier food options in school cafeterias. Studies have found that students who eat healthier, balanced meals during the school day perform better in class, have higher cognitive functioning, and feel more energized and ready to learn. Furthermore, introducing healthier snacks such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and alternative grains can help counteract the effects of processed and sugary snacks that are popular amongst students.   To effectively implement healthier food options in school cafeterias, the following steps should be taken:   1. Conduct an audit of the current food items offered in the school lunchroom.  2. Survey the students to learn their preferences for healthy snacks.  3. Introduce nutritious whole foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, seeds, and nuts, as well as plant-based substitutes to traditional lunch items.  4. Educate the students on the importance of making healthier food choices.  5. Set aside time for students to participate in activities that promote healthy eating habits.  6. Establish a partnership with local farmers and food vendors to provide fresh, wholesome food items for the school lunchroom.  7. Monitor the implementation, adjusting the plan as needed.		1
Dear, TEACHER_NAME  I understand that you are considering changing the cell phone policy to having them at lunch and free times or not having them at all. My classmates and I would appreciate if you would not even think about the second policy and choose the first one.  Students need there phones for many things when they are at school such as calling there parents, reminding a fellow student of class work, or knowing weather or not to go to your house or a friends after school. choosing the second policy may make some students angry and use his or her phone any way which could result in many detentions, serious reprimands, and confiscation of phones. With all of these things happening wouldn't be so much easier just to allow the students to use his or her phones during free periods. Teachers also could also examine the phone to make sure they have not been used before and after class. Many students need his or her phone for various reasons.  I know you do not want to upset any students so it would be in your best interest to stick to policy number one. The phones could also help you by upping turned in homework because the students could remind each other of upcoming assignments. If you did not let them use there phones it could cause scores to actually go down. Nobody wants that right so just stay with policy one.  In conclusion, most of my classmates could not go a day without there phones. I did not know how much easier having a phone made your school life until I got one. I have not parted with it since. If you want happier students go with policy number one.      		0
Dear principal  I think that our school should have cell phones in school. I believe that if we all had our cell phones everyone will listen to what you say. If you do this the teachers that are watching the students will be looking if they have them out in lunch or their free time. The other reason you had maybe wouldn't work and students will bring their phones to school secretly. If students don't fallow the policy and use them in classes then it will make it right to take the policy away. The second policy will make the teachers more alert and make the teacher teach slower. This will make them slower because they will be checking every time. I believe that if students have their cell phones at lunch that they won't be asking the principal as much. It says that they will have to turn off their phones in class but they do have lunch and their free periods. Witch is a good time to text or message their friends.		0
 The rise of online learning has given students the opportunity to attend classes from the comfort of their own homes. In my opinion, this is a valuable tool that can benefit a wide range of individuals. For some, online classes may be the only option due to scheduling conflicts or the need for additional credits to graduate. For others, online classes can provide a more flexible and convenient learning experience that allows them to balance their studies with work or other responsibilities.  One advantage of online classes is the ability to work and study at the same time. This can be especially beneficial for students who have to work in the morning to support a family. Additionally, online classes often offer more flexibility in terms of scheduling, allowing students to complete assignments and attend lectures at their own convenience. This can be particularly advantageous for students who have other responsibilities, such as caring for children or working a part-time job.  However, there are also some disadvantages to online classes. One major disadvantage is the potential for distractions. With the ability to attend classes from anywhere with an internet connection, students may be tempted to use their phone or other devices to check social media or engage in other activities that can distract them from their studies. Additionally, some students may struggle with the lack of structure and guidance that comes with online classes. Without the support of a teacher or classmates, students may be less motivated to complete their assignments and may struggle to stay on track.  Overall, the decision to attend classes from home through online learning depends largely on the individual student's needs and preferences. For some, the flexibility and convenience of online classes can be a valuable tool for achieving their academic goals. For others, the potential for distractions and lack of structure may make traditional classroom learning a better fit. Ultimately, it is up to each student to carefully consider their options and determine which approach will work best for them.		1
While the Facial Action Coding System technology described in the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" could potentially provide some benefits if used to read student emotions in the classroom, there are also significant risks and ethical concerns that need to be considered.   One potential benefit is that teachers may be able to gain insights into how effectively their lessons are being delivered by monitoring student expressions in real-time. If many students appear bored or confused, the teacher could adjust their approach. This could help improve teaching methods. Additionally, signs of negative emotions like stress or anxiety may help identify students who need extra support. On the surface, this type of monitoring seems aimed at helping students.  However, there are also several issues with this approach. Firstly, student emotions are complex and identifying them based solely on facial expressions could lead to incorrect interpretations. More subtle emotions may not be detected accurately. Secondly, constant monitoring of expressions may make students feel uncomfortable or lack autonomy over their emotional responses. They may censor their natural reactions if aware their faces are being analyzed. This could have unintended mental health consequences over time.   Perhaps most importantly, without student consent this type of surveillance could be considered a violation of privacy. Classrooms are intended to be safe learning spaces, not laboratories for emotional experimentation. Even with consent, there are questions around how the data would be stored, shared, and possibly used against students in the future. Overall individual student privacy should take precedence over potential teaching benefits when such invasive technologies are involved.  In conclusion, while the goal of helping students through emotional insights is reasonable, the risks to student well-being and privacy posed by this surveillance technology outweigh any educational value it could provide in a classroom setting. More research and oversight would be needed to address ethical concerns before such systems could be considered appropriate. On balance, their use does not seem justified or advisable given less invasive alternative means exist to gain student feedback and identify needs. Student consent, well-being and privacy should be top priorities in educational decisions.		1
I disagree with requiring all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurriculars provide many benefits, mandating participation prevents students from having choices that align with their individual needs, interests and circumstances.  Every student is different, with unique strengths, challenges and priorities. Forcing involvement in extracurricular activities ignores these differences and can negatively impact students' well-being and education. Some prefer focusing on academics, others have family responsibilities or jobs that demand their time after school. Competing priorities should not be dismissed. Extracurriculars are best pursued voluntarily, as additional enrichment opportunities rather than compulsory obligations.   When students have autonomy in choosing how to spend their free time, they are more likely to engage in activities they genuinely enjoy and find meaningful. Forced participation runs the risk of resentment and half-hearted involvement that does little to cultivate the teamwork, leadership and time management skills extracurriculars aim to develop. It's also unreasonable to assume all students have the physical ability, financial means or availability to accommodate a mandatory extracurricular on top of their coursework.  Instead of requiring across-the-board participation, a better approach is providing students with options and encouraging them to find activities aligned with their priorities and talents. The benefits of extracurriculars like learning time management and collaboration are best realized when students choose involvement based on personal motivation rather than compulsion. Overall well-being and academic success are maximized by policies respecting individual circumstances and preferences for how students direct their energy outside the classroom. For these reasons, I do not think making extracurricular participation a requirement is the right decision.		1
 The face on Mars, also known as the "Face of Mars," is a famous geological feature that has long intrigued scientists and explorers. It is a massive, curved structure that can be seen from Earth using telescopes, and appears to be a giant smile or a face staring up at the sky.   The face on Mars is the result of billions of years of erosion and weathering of the planet's surface. It is believed to have formed due to the interaction of water and minerals in the soil, causing the formation of vast amounts of dust and debris that have been swept away by the planet's winds over millions of years. The resulting structure has been shaped by the planet's gravity and magnetic fields, as well as by the forces of the solar wind and cosmic radiation.  Scientists have been studying the face on Mars for decades, using a variety of tools and techniques to learn more about its origins and composition. One technique commonly used is remote sensing, which involves using satellites and telescopes to measure the properties of the surface from a distance. By analyzing the data collected from these remote sensing instruments, scientists can learn about the geological processes that have shaped the face on Mars, as well as the composition and structure of the materials that make up the planet's surface.  Another approach to studying the face on Mars is to use in-situ resources utilization (ISRU) technologies, which involve collecting materials from the planet's surface and bringing them back to Earth for further analysis. This approach has been used to collect and study samples of the rock and soil that make up the face on Mars, as well as to gather data on the planet's climate and weather.  Despite the many studies and research efforts that have been directed towards the face on Mars, it still remains something of a mystery. Scientists believe that there is still much to learn about the geological processes that have formed this intriguing feature, as well as about the materials and structures that make up the surface on which it is located.  One of the biggest challenges in studying the face on Mars is the extreme conditions of the planet. Its surface is characterized by deep valleys, steep cliffs, and vast amounts of dust and debris, as well as by the presence of liquid water and other hazardous substances. Understanding these conditions and how they have evolved over time is crucial for gaining a better understanding of the face on Mars, as well as of the planet's overall environment and history.  In conclusion, the face on Mars is a fascinating and mysterious geological feature that has captivated scientists and explorers for centuries. While much has been learned about its origins and composition, there is still much to discover about this intriguing structure and the extreme conditions in which it formed. As our understanding of the planet and its surface continues to evolve, we can expect to make new discoveries about the face on Mars and its place in the Universe.		1
Dear,  Senitors  I Write to you about the Electional Colleges because, i beleive that it is fair to change it to which ever runner has the most votes will become president. I understand that each candidate running for prsident has his or her own group of electors chosen by the political party but it depends if they chose their electors respondsibly  Electoral College consists of 538 electors , but a majority of 270 votes are required to elect the president. Voters don't vote for the president they would have to vote for a a slate of democratic electors pledged to that person and if that person won they would go to congress and that runner would get that amount of electoral votes.  But if a tie happens the electrol vote would go to the house of representatives where they would have to decide who the president will be and senates would decide who the Vice President would be.  But in all my oppionion should be that who ever has the most popular vote will vbe prsedent.  Thank You ,  PROPER_NAME        ¬†    ¬†    		0
 The electoral college is a system used in the United States to elect a president. It is made up of electors who are chosen by each state in the country, and the winner of the electoral college is the person who receives the most votes from the electors. However, not everyone believes that the electoral college is fair, and there has been much debate about whether it should be abolished. In this essay, I will be looking at both the benefits and drawbacks of the electoral college, and examining whether it works effectively in choosing a president.  One of the main benefits of the electoral college is that it gives each state a fair amount of representation in the election. This is because each state has a certain number of electors based on its population, with larger states having more electoral votes than smaller states. This means that larger states have more influence over the election than they would if the president was chosen solely on a national vote.  Another advantage of the electoral college is that it can prevent extremists from winning the election. If a candidate appeals only to one type of voter, such as young or angry voters, they may win the popular vote but lose the electoral college vote. This means that candidates have to appeal to a broader range of voters in order to win the election, which can help to prevent the election from being dominated by a single group or agenda.  However, there are also some drawbacks to the electoral college. One of the main disadvantages is that it can lead to a candidate focusing more on certain states than others, rather than the entire country. Since states with large populations tend to have more electoral votes, candidates may focus more on winning these states, rather than trying to appeal to voters in smaller states. This can lead to uneven representation in the election, as certain states are given more importance than others.  Another problem with the electoral college is that it can make it difficult for third-party candidates to succeed. Third-party candidates typically have limited resources and may not be able to compete effectively in larger states with more electoral votes. This can mean that they are excluded from the election or are only able to win marginal support.  In conclusion, the electoral college is a system that has both advantages and drawbacks. It gives each state a fair amount of representation in the election and can prevent extremists from winning. However, it can also lead to uneven representation in the election and make it difficult for third-party candidates to succeed. Ultimately, whether or not the electoral college works effectively in choosing a president is a subjective question, and it will likely continue to be debated in the United States.		1
Did you know that having an extracurricular activity can help you with high school and college? Have you ever had a passion for some kind of activity or sport, but couldn't do it because you never had the time? Well, now is your chance to achieve your goal of getting on varsity football, or working in student council. I agree with the principal that every student should have at least one extracurricular activity because it can help build new friends, build your self-esteem and confidence , and lastly it might just help you get a scholarship in¬†college if you do a sport.  You know it's a struggle to make friends these days. People working together and helping each other out could possibly help them become friends. That is just one of the many perks of being on a team or group that supports you. The feeling of love, support, and praise can boost our confidence. This is one of the reasons why everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity.  Building your self esteem and confidence is one of the many things that we can achieve on our own. All you have to do is believe in your self and trust your friends. Supporting your friends and yourself can help everyone on a team come together as one. That is just one way of boosting yourself and your friends/teammates. Although, it is very important to encourage each other you must remember that doing it in a negative way could only effect your relationship with that person. That was my second reason for why I agree with the principal.  We all know that many people don't go to college due to the fact that they can't afford it. Well, maybe if you take a sport as your, extracurricular activity and you're good at it, they might consider giving you a full scholarship. Just keep in mind that you have to go to the same college and you can't quit the sport. As long as you enjoy it you will be fine. That is my last reason for supporting the principals decision.  Now knowing that picking an extracurricular activity can help you throughout your life. Consider that it can boost our confidence, help you gain friends, and many more. Hoping that you read this and agree with the principals decision. I also hope that you apply it to your life and become as successful as you can.		0
 This essay is about a cowboy who rode the waves.  The cowboy's name was Roy Rogers, and he was known for his incredible horse riding skills. However, there was another side to Roy, one that he kept hidden beneath his cowboy boots. This little-known fact about Roy Rogers was that he was also a surfer.  Roy's love for surfing began in 1942 when he traveled to Honolulu, Hawaii with Duke Kahanamoku, a famous Hawaiian swimmer and entertainer. Roy had always been fascinated by the surf, and Duke had a little something to do with that. Duke was a master of both surfing and rodeo, and he introduced Roy to the sport.  Roy was immediately in love with the ocean. He spent several minutes on the beach every day, watching the waves crash down on the shore. He spent countless hours dreaming about one day riding those waves. And he was determined to make that dream a reality.  Roy spent the next several months learning everything he could about surfing. He took lessons from Duke and other surfing instructors in Honolulu, and he practiced every day. Roy soon became known as one of the best surfers on the island, and he quickly won a reputation for his incredible skills.  However, Roy's love for surfing did not stop there. He continued to indulge his love for the ocean throughout the rest of his life. Whenever he had time off from working, Roy would head to the beach to catch some waves.  The ocean proved to be a great escape for Roy, as it allowed him to escape from the pressure of being a famous cowboy. When Roy was out on the waves, he was just a guy, enjoying some peace and quiet. It was a great way to unwind, and it helped Roy stay sane in the limelight.  In conclusion, Roy Rogers was a cowboy who rode the waves. He had a passion for both rodeo and surfing and enjoyed both sports in his spare time. While he is known for his incredible horse riding skills, Roy's true love was the ocean. The ocean proved to be a great escape for Roy, and his love for surfing helped him keep sane in the limelight.		1
 In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" by author Ian Sample, the topic of facial recognition technology arises multiple times throughout the article. While the majority of the article speaks upon the subject of the history of the Facial Action Coding System, and how it was originally created as a tool to analyze emotion in art, towards the end of the article Sample briefly mentions the use of the system in classroom settings. In the modern day, the system is no longer just a tool to be used for art analysis, but rather has become utilized by teachers in the classroom in attempt to make their lesson plans more effective. Although this use of the system may have some benefits, I believe that it is not necessarily the best tool to be used in a classroom, due to its inaccuracies and invasion of privacy.   Sample states that "the system could be used to give teachers instant feedback on how well their lesson plans are working, or to monitor and evaluate the emotional state of students." This use of the system may allow teachers to quickly change their methods in the classroom, which could be beneficial to students who may not be engaged in the current lesson plan. However, I believe that the system could potentially be inaccurate, as there have been many cases in the past in which the system was incorrect in its facial recognition. This could potentially give teachers a false perception of their students emotions, which could affect the student's grades and the teacher's opinion of them.   Furthermore, the use of this system in the classroom could allow teachers to invade the privacy of their students. Many students may not want their teachers to know of their emotional state, especially if they are struggling. This could potentially lead to a situation in which a student is in an emotional state and needs to leave the classroom, but feels as if they cannot due to their teacher being aware of their emotional state. Although the system may have potential benefits in the classroom, I believe that it is not the best tool to be used in this setting due to its inaccuracies and invasion of privacy.   Overall, the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" was very interesting and well-written. The article engaged me as a reader from beginning to end. However, as mentioned earlier in the essay, I take issue with the conclusion of the article which discusses the use of Facial Action Coding System in the classroom. I do believe that the system could be beneficial to teachers, but I do not think that it is the best tool to be used in a classroom. 		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.  The Electoral College is a system that was created in the late 18th century, when the United States was a very different country. At that time, communication and transportation were slow and difficult, and it was not feasible to hold a national popular vote. The Electoral College was created as a compromise between those who wanted the President to be elected by Congress and those who wanted the President to be elected by the people.  However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary or desirable. The United States is now a much more populous and interconnected country. Communication and transportation are now easy and fast. It is now perfectly feasible to hold a national popular vote for President.  In fact, there are many good reasons to abolish the Electoral College. First, it is undemocratic. The candidate who wins the most popular votes does not always win the election. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College and became President. This is simply not fair.  Second, the Electoral College gives too much power to a few small states. The candidate who wins a state with a small population can receive the same number of electoral votes as the candidate who wins a state with a large population. This is unfair to the voters in the large states.  Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on a few "swing states" and ignore the rest of the country. This is because the Electoral College gives all of a state's electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in that state. This means that candidates have no incentive to campaign in states where they are sure to lose. This is bad for democracy because it means that the needs of the people in those states are not being heard.  For all of these reasons, I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. I urge you to support legislation to do so.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Some student would love to work on school work at home, due to the lack of sleep and possibly health issues. Working from home can teach students what its like to be independent and responsible. Some students wake up to being home alone in the mornings, some students have parents home or siblings home in the morning. Online classes would help students work at their own pace, along with teaching them how to be responsible. Some kids are just not motivated to get up in the mornings to go to school and deal with the same situation over and over again. As one of those students i feel as if online schooling would help the kids who are having a hard time getting up in the morning, to go to school and deal with stressful and anxiety inducing situations.  Students who have a hard time finding a reason to get up in the morning, hard time finding motivation, would probably prefer to do their school work at home. Some students and social anxiety, some suffer from depression, and some suffer from sleeping issues. We need to keep in mind that not all students are the same and all have a personal life to include some issues here and there. Some students may have tried to talk about this and no one has acknowledged¬†their idea, which causes them to be more stressed and feel dismissed. Being one of these students i would also like to share that doing school online may be more stressful to some students, but others would much rather deal with the stress of doing online school than go to school and feel dismissed.  Students have to go to school and deal with people bullying them, and deal with other students that have no respect what so ever. Some kids dont want to be around that or have developed problems due to having to deal with bullying or feeling alone and dismissed. Many kids get up in the morning and face all of that head on and dont speak on the issue because they want to get it done and over with, but little does everyone know that a person can only take but so much of the same thing before it becomes a major problem not only for them, but for others as well. Students and kids should have to feel the way that they do growing up into an adult, some people say "you're learning how to be an adult."  Students, to include me, would feel way more comfortable working from how, rather than coming into school and dealing with the same situations over and over again. The skills it takes to learn online would help older teens and young adults learn what its like to be responsible for your own things, without teachers giving them the free pass. If you dont have something you need for online school than you cant learn, causing you to fall way behind and more likely to redo the class.  Not only will students learn the importance of being responsible, they'll also learn the importance of time management. Young students should be able to learn without feeling like they have no choice. Students who are on the line of becoming 18 and up should be able to have a say in their education.  We also have to keep in mind of students home situation, if the student is becoming or is 18, we need to think¬†about their home situation. Some of them might not have a home or parents to help them. If they go through the school they should be able to do online schooling. With that being said I feel as if student should be able to choose to finish¬†high school¬†online, as well as be able to express why they'd feel better off doing online school. A student choosing to do online school seems so much better than a student choosing to drop out in my opinion. I feel like the online school option would reduce the number of drop outs by a lot.  Students would feel like they have a say in their education along side being heard. The amount of school days being missed by student would go down as well because they wouldnt feel pressured into doing something they have no interest in doing. Graduation number would go up due to more students participating in classes even if its alone schooling.¬†		0
Traveling outside of our planet ,we call Earth, seems bizarre. Unless NASA sends a couple astronauts out to the moon, traveling to any other planet is not something a person would be used to hearing everyday. Imagine going to a planet where it is surrounded by a carbon dioxide atmosphere and a corrosive sulfuric acid atmosphere combined. While it only gets up to a little over 100 degrees in many places aorund the world in the summer, this planet gets over 800 degreees Fahrenheit year round. Obviously, it seems impossible to live there without dying immediately. But, isn't that why we have spacecrafts to go off and do missions? Many spacecrafts only make it a few hours when sent to this planet, making it nearly impossible. Surprisingly enough, this planet is known as Venus. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density, size and distance, which makes sense why so many scientists and employees at NASA are so interested in studying Venus.  Venus is known as Earth's sister planet. Earth being very similar to Venus, Venus is extremely different in ways it is hard for a human being to imagine. But, once upon a time, Venus was more Earth-like than ever before. It was covered in large oceans with a suitable way for forms of life to live there. Today, Venus has some similarities, such as a surface of rocky sediment and has valleys, mountains, and craters. Being so similar to Earth, scientists decided to take up on diving deeper in the world of Venus. Venus has an incredible amount of dnager, which is why NASA has options for making the mission safe but also scientifically productive.  One of several options would be to send humans to study Venus floating above the fray. With this option, the humans would be able to survive, but still have to go through 170 degree temperatures. An obvious disadvantage to floating above the fray would be the distance barrier. It is very hard to collect samples of rock, gas, or photos from that far of a distance. Rendering standard forms of photograph and videography become ineffective because floating from such a distance provides limited insight.  The right but more difficult path to take would be figuring out a way to reach ground level on Venus. Not impossible, researchers are working on innovations that would let the machines last long enough to contribute meaningfully to get more knowledge on Venus. Some of the simplified electronics are made of silicon carbid and have also been tested in some of the extreme dangers that Venus has. A second similar machine would have been similar to mechanical computers used base in the 1940s during World War II. These type of devices make calculations by using gears and levers without the need of electronics. Today's modern technology would be fragile to be able to sustain any type of conditions in Venus, although it is way easier and faster to use modern day technology for this specific challenge.  Having danger limit the human brain is one of the "easier said than done" situations. After a while, humans will become to curious and will want to know more about Venus and about all of the dangers that come with it. There is no other way to figure these things out other than figuring out a way to see all of it for ourselves. Using our curiousity, researchers and those who work at NASA might be able to create new innovations or ways to see all of the dangers that are within the scary planet of Venus.		0
Phones and Driving  The number one cause of death among teenagers is car accidents. We can only assume that a number of these accidents were caused by distracted drivers. A distraction can come from anything, the radio, food, passengers in the car, and especially, the topic of this essay, cell phones.  The epidemic of drivers dying by the distraction of cell phones has become a major problem in the US because more and more technical advancements are happening as time goes on. When people are distracted while driving, even though it isn't intentional and they may not be thinking about it at the time, they are putting themselves and others' lives at risk. In the state of Georgia, it has become an official law that you can't even have your cell phone in your hand while driving. It is called the "Hands-free" law. You have to either have it completely put away, or up on a hands free cell phone stand in your car. If you get caught with your phone in your hand while driving in Georgia, you will get a ticket.  Currently there is no national law banning the use of cell phones while driving in the US; however, 39 out of 50 states now have laws banning the use of cell phones while driving, and almost every year a new one gets added. The rates of deaths by texting while driving have decreased since. In 2017, over 3,000 lives had been claimed by distracted driving, almost 300 of those lives being teens. That number has decreased since then.  In order to stop this epidemic from growing or even continuing, a national law banning cell phone use while driving should be put into place. Every year, the US is getting closer to that goal.        		0
What would the world be like if we could just type in your wanted destination and just go withoug needing a driver, how would the world react for such a thing?  Could the car just think on it's own? How would everything even work on the car?  In my opinion, we shouldn't have driverless cars untill we can get them to be fully driverless without taking away so many taxi jobs, wrecks, and confusion during them wrecks.  I don't think that we should have driverless cars, because taxi companies would loose all their emploies, it would save the company money but, also what about that families? How are they going to get their next meal on the table without a job? Driverless cares would leave people hungry and jobless, then their kids would be taken by DCS and them the ' family ' would be seperated. Meaning driverless cars are bad for the people because it can cause poverty among the people.  Also, driverless cars could cause many wrecks by not having exact measurment of when to stop. And much of the driving laws include a person to be driving. How would the car get it's licentce ? Would it have a liceence? When driving you use your brain a car doesnt have a brain aso it wouldn't work out for them. In other words, you need a person , a driver, still to have a driverless car ; so would it really be considered a driverless car? No.  Then, theres the part when they do get into a wreck, who's fault would it be because there isn't a driver to blame? who do they sue? how wouold insurence be on a driverless care?  The company who manerfaactured the car would be the one to blame because they should have prepared for the situation, also they would be the ones the be sued. It's just a bad idea all together because the company will go bankruped.  So, think again, how would the world be if there was a such thing as driverless cars? would it be good or would it be bad? we already know that its gonna be a bad idea so why am i even asking you ? It's bad because iit takes jobs from hardworking drivers, causes wreacks, and confustion. So, driverless cars for all is a NO GO.		0
Dear, Senator I think the president should be elected by popular vote not electors. Heres some reasons why i think the president should be voted by popular vote and not electors.  One reason is when you vote for your president your actually voting for the presidents elector. So basically your not voting fot a president your voting for a elector that votes for you. After the election the government prepares a "certificate of ascertainment" a certificate of ascertainment is a listing of all the candidates who ran for president along with the names of there electors. The certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning president and which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the elector in december of election year.  Another reason is more people would rather abolish electoral college. Electoral college is dumb because there was a gallop poll in 2000 taken shortly afte Al Gore. In the poll Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency because of the electoral college. In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, Bush received 271 electoral votes and Gore received 266. Under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors. Who can be electors? It can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state, sometimes state conventions, sometimes state partys central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates.  Last but not least the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960 segregationnists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, "faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their partys candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please. What happens if a state sends two slates of electors to congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, validated only his opponents electors. The most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote in that case the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president and The Senate would choose the vicepresident. Each state only casts one vote that means the single representatives from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters would have as much say as California who represents 35 million voters. An electoral tie seems unlikely think of this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976 a tie would have occurred if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted differently. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.  What im trying to say is the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all including Rhode island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaigh ad. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrartional. The best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions. Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college.		0
Cars make it exceptionally easy to travel and move around. Auto use permets an individual to go to places they have not been before. In Europe, the countries that share the Schengen space allow Europeans to move freely. To avoid pricy plane and train tickets, a lot of Europeans use their cars to go to an entirely different country and experience a variety of different cultures in a matter of hours. It is most certainly a priviledge. Despite the many pros of having a car, the cons outweight them. Throughout this essay I will explain the advantages of limiting car usage.  In many countries and cities car usage has dropped. Some countries,it is purely accidental or due to economic reasons and in some cities and countries, this decline is intended. In a city called Vauban in Germany, citizens have given up their cars. In this city,street parking,driveways and garages are more often than not forbidden. This may seem strange to¬† not have the priviledge to own a car or¬† a garage. But most of the residents have moved out from the city to live here. Heidrun Walter claims that she is much happier this way and before she was always tense.70% of the Vauban's family do not own a car, and 57% sold their cars to live in Vauban. This particular city is a mere example of a growing trend in Europe,the United States and various other country. The plan is to seperate suburban life from auto use;this movement is called "smart planning".  In opposition, to these efforts, automobiles are usually an important factor to the suburbs where usually middle-class people live. This causes a huge impediment to current efforts to significally reduce greenhous gas emissions from passenger cars. In Europe,passenger cars are the reason for the 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions; in the United states that number almost quadriples in size in some car-intensive areas. The approach is to make suburbs more compact rather than having malls on the border on distant highways.  Due to smog and pollution to this global city's air, Paris enforced a driving ban to put an end to polution. 4,000 drivers were rightfully so fined that day. This issue had to be taken seriously for a greater cause. For example, for the smog levels to decrease and to purify the air in the cities and suburbs and to prevent pollution. Public transit was free for those five days that the ban was enforced. Congestion dropped 60% in Paris, ever since the driving ban. The smog rivaled Beijing, which is often known for being one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blamed because of a tax policy¬† in¬† favor of diesel fuel in France. More than half of vehicles run on diesel fuel in France.  In the Colombia's capital, Bogota, many colombians hiked,skated or took buses to work in spirit of their car free day. Personally I think this was an extravagent idea. It teaches people to not be so dependent on cars. This day significantly reduced traffic jams,smog and promoted transportation. This was a wonderful oppurtunity to lower stress and air pollution at the same time! Parks and sports bloomed that day, sidewalks that were unfinished and in poor conditions were replaced,the traffic decreased and restaurants blossemed. This car free day had an amazing impact on¬† this community and the world.  Due to recents studies, Americans are driving less¬† and buying few cars as the years go by. The miles driven have peaked in 2005 , but as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person dropped 9% , and was equal to the percentage in Janurary 1995. Scientist state that this decline is beneficial for carbon emissions and the enviroment. Although this might affect dearly the car industries. The rise of cellphones,internet and apps this permits a more flexible way of making commuting arangements,and the evolution of vans services.  A lot of people have been using public transportation and biking to get around. There has been a drop from 16-39 year olds in getting their license. Getting license is not as big as of priority for those people. They revolve their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take busses and trains or car-pool with friends.  To conclude, I strongly believe that limiting car use would benefit different aspects in peoples lives. But for people to give up using cars,the recontruction of suburban cities is a very important. I live in the suburbs and despite the houses around, you would need a car to go to the grocery store,restaurant and to have fun with your friends. Highways usually circle around suburban cities and that¬† may cause congestion. To make car usage less of a priority for citizens, we would have to think of the greater cause and to restablish cities to not prohibit people from moving around. The decline in car use will improve the world for the generations to come.    		0
i think for students the academic level for sports should be a B or higher think about i kid who like to play sports would only have to do the minimal amount of work to do what they love if u put it up to a B kids who play sports would have to try harder to do what they love that would improve test scores for the school and help a lot of things.  and look at how many kid play sport u could make more sports so more kids would want to join the sports and then more kids would have to try to get better grades to do the sport they love it would also help no child left behind law by improving test scores so u can get better funding for your school and the funds could go to the sports so more people would want to play them so more people would have to get there grades up witch would improve more test scores so u could aford good things for the sch		0
The use of cars today in our modern world is crazy! Everywhere you look there's cars going down the road, parked in a garage, or on TV. Now think of a world without them...it would be different, wouldnt it? Yes, indeed it would be, the world would be less hectic and cleaner place to live.  First, Life without cars would make life much less hectic. In Vaunban,Germany there is an upscale community where there are no cars. People either walk, ride bikes or take the public tram. A survey shows "70 percent of Vanuban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here". People move to Vauban to enjoy a "carfree"...stress free life. "Im much happier this way" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor." source 1 paragraph 3 The "carfree" world of not having to worry about car payemrnt, insurance, and gas money is a whole lot better than a car dependent world.  Second, Limiting our car use would help make this planet cleaner. Pollution issues have gotten so bad that "...Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city". Source 2 paragraph 10 In paragraph 14 it states that "after fivedays of intensive smog...the smog rivaled Beijing,China, which is one one of the most polluted cities in the world". France uses more diesel than gasoline, therefore making up 67 percent of all vehicles in France. The use of these harsh fossil fuels is a huge problem that can help be controlled by limiting our use of automobiles.  Third, Although some may argue that we need cars to fuction in our modern world, there are other options that we can choose. For example, If everyone took public transportation such as the subway we would be cutting back tremendously on the amout of feul consumed. Another advantage of using other forms of transportation other than a car would be that you wouldnt have to worry about your car not starting, or not having enough money too fill your tank. Other forms of transportation would always be reliable and convenent. You would also feel good about helping the enviornment by not adding extra gases to the ozone.  To finish up, Limiting our use of cars would make life easier and cleaner. In source 3 it states "Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife. Many people are convinved that a "carfree" life would be much nicer than the hectic carconsumed life we've all grown so accustom too. Limiting our use of cars is a good idea for our stressful lives.		0
The Facial Action Coding System will not work, because it can only understand six basic emotions, when their are much more. It can only understand happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saness. It doesn't understand regret,passion, and hungar. It does not have sempathy, so it will be hard for the Facial Action Coding System to help the stundent with the promblem it detects. The Facial Action Coding System won't understand why the stundent will need to leave to use the restroom. And it won't understand why the stundent act out on emotion. Or what the emotion can make then do.  Yes the Facial Action Coding System can dect basic emotions by looking at the facial musles, but their are so many more emotion beyound that. The Facial action Coding System has no teaching ability. Nor does it under how teach and explain thing in a simple way. It does not know how to expain things to the younger stundents how don't understand things. The Facial Action Coding System is a fantasic idea, but it has a far way to go before it teaches any stundents. 		0
Drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving. In Georgia a hands free law was passed to prevent drivers from doing other things while driving. When drives are distracted they can put their life in danger as well as other people in the car or other people on the road. Drivers should take that into consideration when they are on the roads driving. Drivers should be 100% focused on the road and not concerned about other things such as phones.  Most people can not focus while driving so it is very serious that drivers keep their eyes on the road. Texting and driving is like driving with your eyes clothes one little text can put your life in so much danger. Cars are made with bluetooth so that it lowers the chance of distracted drivers. Drivers should pay attention when they are driving such as drinking and driving. Kids are in the car with drivers when they don't know anything that goes on with drivers.  When you get caught on your by a police officer you can be fined and lose your license. When you lose your license you would have to go through a long process of getting them back. You can also get points taken off your license risking the chance of you doing things as far as traveling and police will be strict on you. You can save many lives just by paying attention to the road because others sometimes don't pay attention.  This texting and driving can be very serious and dangerous. Your family would be sad if something bad happened to you causing you to not make it home all because of a text. With bluetooth cars you can talk to the car a drive its called hands free. You can text people back on the steering wheels its options for that so that it lowers the risk of you taking your eyes off the road. Making it home feels like a big accomplishment to some people.  High Schoolers and younger kids should be required to take a class that teaches them more about the severity of texting and driving. Teens get cars and can't stay off their phones. They are more likely to be the ones to get in an accident. Teens could download a app while driving to preventing them from being on their phones while driving this app helps teens earn discounts on popular things that they want to purchase. Texting while driving should never be allowed!                                 		0
Phones & Driving  Now in the 21st century, the major of humans own and use cell phones daily. The number of teens who are dying or being injured as a result of texting while driving has skyrocketed as mobile device technology has advanced. Texting while driving is a big problem though out the world with the death rate going up every year.  Teens and young adults ages though 18-24 are texting and driving more than any other age group. Texting while driving increases the chances of a person having an accident greatly for being distracted.  Driving while texting is as dangerous as driving drunk.  Driving while texting, as with drunk drivers, are less likely for a person that's texting to notice any signs, people walking in the middle of the road, and the signals coming from other vehicles. The larger phone manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung, could help put something in their phones like an app, or app blocker, to help texters with their problem.  About over 300,000 injuries have occurred every year by accidents caused by texting while driving in 25% of all car accidents resulting in almost 400,000 physical injuries.  550 pedestrians and bicyclists are killed each year in distracted driving accidents.  The poor habits of texting while driving would keep on going nonstop once a person gets used to texting while driving, there is no telling where it will stop. Texting while driving does not encourage a person to care about their surroundings and fosters a sense of detachment from the world at large.  Constantly texting, along with nonstop waiting for that next text to come popping up on your phone screen, looking like a robot is no way to live. The ability to enjoy life and carry on a conversation in person is completely and diminished. Putting down the phone for a few minutes each day could help with your communication skills, and your phone would be put down for once for some rest.  Texting while driving is in the 21st century has changed the way of driving nowadays while technology keeps on advancing the problems gets bigger and bigger and while the death rate would keep on increasing as time goes until everyone fix the texting while driving problems continues.   		0
Dear Principal,  I believe not allowing students to bring their cell phone to school is the best police because many student get distracted during classes, they don't finish there work , and they don't pay attention in class their suppose to do.  There are many cases in where a student get distracted in class and doesn't know what the teacher is teaching or talking about most of the time. They have their cell phone in their pockets and they stat texting their friends. At the end when the teacher asks the students question about the lesson many students wont be able to answer the question because their distracted on there phones. They wont be able to understand at all.  The second reason I think you shouldn't allow students to bring there cell phones to school because the majority of the time the students don't finish their work. they find excuses to go to the bathroom and talk on the phone. They tell the teacher many excuses so they wont get a bad grade. At the end of the day they get what they get because of their cell phones.  Many times of the day when a student gets home and they have to do home work they don't know how to do it or how its suppose to be done because they don't pay attention in the class.  They text they get on the internet and the get distracted they didn't pay attention in class so the don't have 100 percent material other students have because the didn't listen to the teacher when she was talking.  in conclusion the best thing to do is to bad cell phones from school and not let kids bring it from home.		0
Have you ever wanted to travel overseas to visit places while at the same time helping others and having fun? That can happen you just have to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. At this program you can help others by taking care of the animals on a cattle boat that you ride from place to place. You also get to visit the unique places at the location your heading. Finally when its time for the return trip you get to have loads of fun by playing all sorts of fun games on the cattle boat.  Like I said before you get to help people which makes yourself feel really proud. You help them by bringing them animals so they can recover from the war. After helping people you get to see all the unique places at the place you visit. For example I once got to visit the Acropolis in Greece which was pretty special. Finally its time to return but the return trip isn't sad its exciting, because you get to play all sorts of games from tennis tournaments to whittling.  I personally enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy so you should join. Remember all the fun you will have on the return trip! Also remember that you are helping people so you should feel proud of yourself. Finally don't forget to visit all the fun and unique sites at the places you visit. I hope you participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.		0
People can always be wrong, you dont want to make a presentation and show false information, because of someone else's mistake. A lot of people ask others questions they dont know. If you were to ask somebody a open ended question they may not know, they could quite possibly give you a random guess that you did not know was a guess. Getting false information can lead to many bad possibilities such as, messing up a presentation, or getting a question wrong on a test. Dont trust everyone you meet for 100% accurate information.  People are wrong a lot¬†of the time. Others can have the same knowledge as you but you dont realize it. Somebody could have a different answer from somebody else. Lets say you ask 2 people the same question, and they both get different answers, but one of them agrees with you, it's still a possibility that all of them are wrong. Ask as many people as you want to answer the question, and when it feels like a good point to stop asking, your best bet is to chose the majority answer.  Ask someone you trust. It is always better to ask someone you know personally. Ask a friend you trust , or a family member. Asking a random person on the street is as big of a risk as gambling. Always ask someone trusted by you, or your family that you know will give you there honest well thought out opinion.  Ask someone that knows the question topic better. If someone in your family, or that you know has a PHD, or masters degree, or so on that is in the topic your asking about, it's always good to try to ask them first. If you are on tour,or a event that has a guide telling you information, ask the tour guide a question, and not your friend. Always ask a teacher that is in the subject you have a question on first before anyone else. Always ask somebody you know has learned about it.  Ask a trusted adult. People can always be wrong. Ask someone you trust that will give you there honest opinion. Ask a qualified person. Finally, ask multiple people.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
Cellphone usage in school can introduce a variety of risks for students. With access to phones, students may be more likely to engage in cyberbullying, as it is easier to hide and spread hurtful comments online. In addition, the risk of cheating can increase, as students can access answers from the internet or exchange information among themselves quickly and discreetly. Moreover, cellphones can be a distraction, making it harder for students to pay attention in class and complete their work. With all of these risks in mind, it is clear why schools should not allow the use of cellphones. Allowing for such an activity in the classroom not only compromises students ?safety and attentiveness, but also encourages a culture of cheating and bullying.		1
Does the Electoral College Work?  Mr. Senator,  I believe that the Electoral College should stay in process because it consists of 538 electors and the majority (270) that are the electoral votes that are required to elect a president. Elector¬† groups are picked by the runner; the groups help raise votes for the runners to get more word out on what the runner has to offer for our country. Plus, they make sure the elector running, has good legitiment reasons for becomeing our countries representor. With the presidential election held every four years, the Electorial College can be still processing men, and women, who are wanting to represent our country. Furthermore, the state elector running for president, is assisted by our votes, because when you vote for your candidates, you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Once the presidential election is over, the staes governers start a "Certificate of Ascertainment" witch list all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.¬† ¬†    		0
 Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, "Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." I completely agree with this statement, and I have several reasons to support it.  Firstly, the journey of learning and mastering new things is essential for personal growth. It is through this journey that we discover our strengths and weaknesses, and we push ourselves to overcome them. As we learn new things, we become more confident and self-assured, which can lead to new opportunities and experiences.  Secondly, mastering new things can help us achieve our goals and aspirations. Whether it's in our personal or professional lives, having new skills and knowledge can give us an edge and make us more valuable to others. It can also help us stay relevant and competitive in our fields.  Lastly, the final result of our journey of learning and mastering new things is the ability to apply them in any situation. We become more adaptable and resilient, which can help us navigate through challenges and obstacles. It also allows us to share our knowledge and expertise with others, which can be a great source of pride and fulfillment.  In conclusion, I believe that the journey of learning and mastering new things is crucial for personal growth, achieving our goals, and becoming a better version of ourselves. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will not grow."		1
Do you think asking more than one person for advice is a good idea?  Well I think it is, believe it or not when you ask people for advice they have been through the same situation.  Going to ask for advice from more than one person is important.  When you want more advice you should talk to your parents, friends , or a older sibling.  The first person you should talk to is your parents because they are way older than you and they have had more experience with these type of situation.  They also know you better than anyone would because they have raised you and know what the best way for you is. The last reason you should talk to your parent is because they have most likely gone through this problem before which means that they know what will work the best and what wouldn't work.  Most of the time when you ask your parents for advice they give you what solves the problem.  The second person I would recommend talking to is a trusted friend.  They can give you some good advice because you spend almost 6 hours with them at school so they know what happening around you during school.  They would also be pretty honest with you because they want to give you advice that is good for you and that would help.  The final reason to talk with a friend or friends is because this is someone who you can talk to if you don't want to talk about it with you parents and you want to see what they would say before mentioning it to you parents.  The final person I would go talk to is an older sibling.  I would talk to them because they have been in your shoes many times.  So the advice they would give you would help you because it helped them.  Also they can keep this away from your parents.  Not only are they going to give you advice one what you asked them but they can keep it away from your parents until your ready to ask them.  Finally I would ask an older sibling for advice because they are older for a reason.  They most likely are there to help you when you need to so I would use it while you can before they¬†either¬†leave for college or already have left.  Asking more than one person for advice because the more advice you can get the better then end result is for you.¬†¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†		0
Many people believe technology is becoming too advanced for our own good. Maybe they were right, technology is advancing at a rapid rate and can also invade one's privacy. In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" the author describes a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions such as happy, sad, disgust, surprised, and a few other basic emotions. There is debate whether this software should become avaible in classrooms for students and if it is valuable. It is not very valuable, it is an invasion of privacy to use this software to read a students' emotional responses to their work.  Schools around the world are becoming more and more advanced everyday. Students, freshman through seniors, at Floyd Central High School along with hundreds of tother high schools have ipads that students carry around and use in their everyday classes. If they were to have this new software it would not change very many things. "For example, if you smile when a web as appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if your frown, the next ad will be different." What does web ads have to do with a student's education? This only shows that students will be recorded at all times through their ipads and/or computers while they do their school work. This is a huge invasion of privacy to students everywhere who might have to use this new emotional expression software.  The article states, " "A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr Huang predicts."Then it could modify the lesson, like the effective human instructor." " Though it sounds like a step towards the right direction in technology, students will be just as bored doing random classwork on a computer without emotion software watching their every move through a camera. Also, at least 60% of students do better with a teacher in front of them to help rather than learning things online. If this software acts as a effective human instructor, students will still grow confused because as the article states that "...you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.". A student will most likely do better just having a teacher because of the facial expressions or body language a teacher gives while teaching can help them better retain the information given rather than a screen teaching it to them, and if a teacher is doing a lecture in front of a class there is no need for a student to have out a laptop computer or an ipad unless it is called for that class and the teacher would be able to answer questions, not the computer.  The Facial Action Coding System software should not be used in the classroom. It is not of value to a student's education, it would be a waste of money and time to install it onto student ipads or computers. It is a complete invasion of privacy to today's youth to be constantly looked at through a little camera just to see if they are confused or not when they could just simply raise their hand and ask a teacher. Though it has many benefits, it has more pros than cons. The article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" is supposed to convince the audience reading it that Facial Action Coding System software should be put in schools, reading it would make one feel the opposite.      		0
In the article " Unmasking the Face on Mars", there has been an argument about whether or whether not it is a natural landform. Some people suggest that it was formed by alien life on Mars and some people believe that it is a natrual landform. I believe it is a natural landform because of what the scientists have found.  The text states, ...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." Not only was the Face formed but it was also and illusion. The text also states, "...snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos...revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." The scientists had taken a better picture after they viewed it again proving it was a natural landform. Lastly, although not everyone was satisfied, the scientists had stated, " It's not easy to target Cydonia...In fact, it's hard work." This shows that just because the supposed "alien markings" were hidden by clouds or haze, doesn't mean they are alien markings. The text states, " It's not easy to target Cydonia...In fact, It's hard work..." So to prove that the " alien markings" was just a natural landform, scientists took a second look and captured the best photo they have and proved that is was just a butte or a mesa which were " common landforms around the American West." This evidence shows that is is a natural landform that is an equivalent to America's common landforms.  I believe that it is a natural landform because of what scientists have found. Scientists have taken pictures and second looks of those pictures to prove that the Face isn't "alien markings", but a natural landform. All this evidence proves that the Face is a natural landform and while my evidence shows something else, there could be evidence that shows it is alien markings. So what is your view on the Face?		0
 The advancement of technology has led to significant advancements in the automotive industry. One of the most exciting developments in recent years is the emergence of driverless cars. Driverless cars are vehicles that are capable of operating without the need for a human driver. These cars use a combination of sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to navigate the road, make decisions, and operate the vehicle.  The concept of driverless cars is not new. In fact, the idea of self-driving cars has been around for decades. However, with the advent of advanced machine learning algorithms and the proliferation of connected devices, we are now seeing a real possibility of these cars becoming a reality. They have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel, making our roads safer and more efficient.  One of the key advantages of driverless cars is the potential to reduce accidents. Each year, thousands of people are killed in car accidents due to human error, such as drunk driving or distracted driving. Driverless cars have the ability to detect potential hazards on the road and communicate with other vehicles to avoid accidents. They are also equipped with advanced safety features such as automatic emergency braking and lane departure warnings.  In addition to improving road safety, driverless cars could also help reduce traffic congestion. With the ability to communicate with other vehicles and adjust their speed and route accordingly, they could help smooth out traffic flow and reduce congestion. This could lead to a significant reduction in travel times and fuel consumption.  Another benefit of driverless cars is the potential to provide greater accessibility for people with disabilities. For example, people with visual impairments would be able to ride in a driverless car without needing a sighted driver. This would provide greater independence for people with disabilities and could also improve their quality of life.  Driverless cars are still in the early stages of development, and there is much work to be done to ensure their safety and reliability. However, the potential benefits of these cars are enormous. They have the potential to transform the automotive industry and make our roads safer, more efficient, and more accessible.  In conclusion, driverless cars are an exciting and revolutionary development in the field of transportation. They have the potential to make our lives easier, safer, and more convenient. While there is still much work to be done to ensure their safety and reliability, the benefits of driverless cars are clear. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see more and more driverless cars on the road.		1
Dear Florida senator,  I'm a young student, and no I don't have much of a background in political ideas or things, but I know we should keep the Electoral College. This old process was created to make electing a President easier and faster, which I believe it does.  Now, the Electoral College has 538 electors, but a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Some will argue that we aren't voting for a President but we're voting for the people, or electors, behind them. I would say that they aren't wrong, but we aren't just voting for those electors, we are voting for the whole idea behind their campaiging. We don't vote for the person, we vote for the idea that person agrees to carry out. By having this process, we can focus on getting swing states votes. The votes of these states matter the most, in my opinion, because they are likely to swing at any minute. As said in "  In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President  ", "swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that the are going to decide the election." This helps avoid run-on elections because the small states are likey to just vote for the most popular President, knowing their vote won't really make a difference.  Most states have a "winner-take-all" system that gives all of the electors to the winning candidate. However, there are a few states that have variation with the "proportional representation" idea. The "winner-take-all" system actually works really well. Other parts of the Electoral College has it's problems but not this one. With this process it makes it easy to give all of the votes to one person, this means all of the state will be on the same page and not fighting with itself. This process v. proportional representation, is better in my opinion because it's quicker and helps make the presidental process one step easier.  And lastly, it's a tradition to use the Electoral College. The pedigree for this process was created a really long time ago by some of the most outstanding leaders in our country. The article "  What Is the Electoral College?  " states that, "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens." The process we created as the United States, has its up and downs but it is one of the longest standing traditions we have. Hopefully you take my letter in to consideration. Thank you for reading.

I believe that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. Having a dress code in schools creates a positive learning environment by reducing distractions, increasing respect, and promoting equality among students. When students wear appropriate clothing to school, it helps to keep the focus on academics rather than fashion.  For instance, in schools where dress codes are not enforced, students might come to school wearing inappropriate clothing such as revealing or offensive clothing, which may cause distractions in the classroom. This can make it difficult for other students to concentrate on their studies.  Moreover, dress codes promote respect in schools. When students dress appropriately, they show respect for their teachers and peers. Wearing revealing clothing or clothing with offensive messages can be seen as disrespectful to the school community.  Finally, dress codes promote equality among students. When everyone is wearing the same type of clothing, it eliminates the pressure to keep up with the latest fashion trends. This helps students to focus on their studies rather than worrying about their clothing.  In conclusion, I believe that dress codes in schools are beneficial to the school environment. By reducing distractions, promoting respect, and promoting equality among students, schools can create a positive learning atmosphere for all.		1
Dear Principle,  Community service is an important event. It is a nice thing to do for others. Some people aren't fortunate enough to have the things that others have. I think you should make the students perform at least one community service act. It will teach them many things such as leadership and responsibility.  Students should help others because that could be them and if it was they would want someone to do the same for them. Some people think that community service is boring and a waste of time. The truth is it's really not . It's not just helping others it's taking care of the planet. Who wants to live where there is trash everywhere?  I know i don't. I think you should make students do at least one community service effort whether it's helping somebody in need or picking trash up off the highway. This could teach students how to be helpful and responsible for their community.  Community service is not a waste of time. It helps not only people but the planet too. A community service act could be as little as picking the trash up at a local park. Community service is a nice thing to do.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
Is it possible to make a driverless car the garuntees one hundred percent safetey for the passengers?  The peoples focus should not be on driverless cars. The idea of a car being able to drive around with us having no control over it should greatly scare everyone. There is no telling if the car will malfunction, breakdown, or have any other problems only a dirver could recongize. We will have control over the vehical, but if any problems occur with it it will still be our fault. A car that could drive itself can cuase many hazardous problems for anyone around it, or possibly boring for the people in it.  There are laws that are meant to keep people who are allowed to drive cars safe. "Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passnegers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers," says the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming." This quote is saying that drivers who are more alert are lesser prone to accidents, and breaking drivng laws. How can a driver be alert if cars drive themsleves in the future? "Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars." It is true that in most states it illegal to test drive cars for safety reasons and concerns. These states are trying to keep the people safe, and do so by not allowing self-driven cars. There are facts that prove that selfdriven cars are not a bad idea, and people have been working on imorving them for years.  Some people are really looking forward into the future where there are driverless cars. Google has been working since 2009 to create such a car that would change the world. Google has been testing out such cars to see what they can do to improve them. "Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash," accordining to the article 'Driverless Cars Are Coming.' They have even packed the car with sensors to help detect problems. Other companies are also in the race to create the first working driverless car, and some have seen very good success rates. There are others who have seen the negative side of having these cars around.  Now, the driverless cars sound easy to work. People can just lay back and enjoy a peaceful ride. The truth is that that is not completly correct. The article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" states, "The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over." That means we still have to be in alert for situations the car can not handle. Who would want to sit in a car having to stare at the road, but not do anything to enjoy the ride? Nobody should have to be subjected to that. These new driverless cars do not sound very dirverless or fun to be in.  Cars that can drive themsleves don't sound very safe, or even fun to be in. These cars have been worked on for many years now, and there is no telling when one will be finished. Most states have already passed laws fobidding to even test these cars. So, why should the people be allowed to even drive one? There is a good reason behind this; it is becasue they want to keep us safe. These cars could have problems that we can not detect becasue we are not in control of them.  We should carefully evalutae these cars before we ever decided to get into one.		0
The author suggets that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Venus is the second planet closest to our sun in our solar system. Venus also neighbors with Earth and Mercury. Sometimes we're closer to Mars or other times we are to Venus.  Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. that could mean Venus could be our nearest option to go, other than Mars. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus.  In conclusion, It's a good idea to study Venus because some day, you never know what happens to our planet and might to go to another planet to survive and form a life there. I would rather choose to go Venus because of all life forms it had long ago and maybe humans could still survive in that planet.            		0
Imagine going up to a friend and asking, "What should I do?", then they give you all the wrong answers? This is exactly why seeking multiple opinions is a great way to go. When you are seeking advice, and you look for multiple opinions you can get unbiased opinions, because you have more than one piece of advice. You can also have more advice to choose from, so you really can find the piece of advice that you like the most. The more advice you get, the better your decision is, because you can look at all the opinions and put them together to create an even better solution to the problem.  When seeking advice, sometimes you may get biased opinions. You may find someone who already feels a certain way about something and does not care about what happens to you. When getting advice you may run into things like this. If you get multiple opinions on a subject, you will almost never get all biased opinions. If you just get one opinion and it is biased, then you may put yourself in a bad situation, because you took that piece of advice, not knowing that that advice was biased and would put you in that situation. Making the better choice is what is important. Getting a biased or bad opinion just goes against making the right decision. If you get multiple opinions, and one of them is biased, but you listen to all the other ones, you can tell which one is biased and not make that bad decision. So getting multiple opinions helps you make the right decisions.  If you need good advice but you just want advice that is right for you, seeking multiple opinions is always better. This is because you have more advice to choose from. When getting advice from one person, you may get advice that you like but does not fit with who you are. This is because with only one piece of advice to choose from, because you can't think of your own, you have a small choice that you may not like, but you just do because you did not know what else to do. When getting multiple opinions, you have more advice to choose from so you can always choose the best advice for you and all the other people involved in the situation. With having more decisions to choose from, the decision making can be hard, but with all these choices you can have conversations with people to decide what the true best choice is. If you get multiple decisions, you can get advice that helps you more, therefore making the better decision.  When seeking advice to make a good decision, the more advice you get the better your decision is. With more opinions, you have better solutions. The goal is to try to make the right decision. With only one piece of advice it is awfully difficult to make the right decisions, and even if you do, it would not be as good as a decision made with multiple pieces of advice. This is due to the fact that with a lot of good information you can put it together and take the good parts from a the different pieces of advice and information and combine them into an even better solution to the problem. With one piece of advice, it is impossible to do that. Getting a second¬†opinion is always a very smart decision, especially when you have to make a hard decision, that requires a lot of thinking.  In conclusion, I have shown some reasons out of many that show that getting multiple decisions is always the smart thing to do. Some reasons include that when just getting one opinion it may be a biased or bad piece of advice. Another reason is that when getting more advice you have more pieces of advice to choose from, making the decision better for yourself and the people around you. Finally, having more advice, the better the decision becomes, which is what the goal is, to make the best choice. Getting multiple opinions on a subject is the best way to go, because you will almost always make a better decision than when you did not get multiple pieces of advice.		0
If I were a scientist at NASA I will not believed alien because most of scientists said aliens are not real and I think they just made up of alien. A face on Mars is maybe when the wind blow the dust it trun that face or when they goes there they died and their dead body face is still there. But it's really interesting because that face is really big and it image 3 times bigger than th epixel size. But I believed there are not alien in the other planets or in earth because alien are not real but I have to makesure that I have to ask more question to the smartest scientist and ask about how did that face happen and how are we gonna prove about that. I have to ask more question about that too and they said that face look like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyrmaids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. Some of them don't believe it because they don't see it and they just guess that answer. But when I looked at the picture I think I saw that crown and their face look shiney and in 2001 that face look destroy . I don't believe in aliens but if there was some aliens in that planet they might made that face too and they hid away from that face. I wish I see that picture for real and take some picture and prove it.		0
Summer break is a long three months away from school for students to relax, learn new skills and enjoy themselves. Most students tend to forget everything they are taught throughout the school year over this break. Summer break to majority of students is time for having the best time of their lives doing all the things they love which hardly ever includes academic work. Teacher-designed summer projects would be a very effective way to ensure students keep receiving knowledge throughout their summer break because education is a continuous process. Teachers would be the best choice to design these summer projects because they thoroughly know the syllabus of the course they teach, they would give realistic projects students can complete on time and teachers would be fair in selecting the type and criteria of the project.  Teachers have all the information about the courses they teach and what their students need to know each year. Teacher-designed projects would entail the necessary topics and lessons for students to work on during their summer break. Other people might argue that the students are also well informed about what they are being taught so should create their own summer projects but most students might just have an idea about what they need to know but might not know about the course in detail as much as the teacher does with all their years of experience and trying new approaches to figure out what works best for their students. Students might also just want to create projects that would be very easy to complete just so they can get it over with. At the end of the day if students are allowed to create their own projects they end up learning nothing new because it was based on stuff they already knew. For example a Geometry teacher teaching tenth graders would not create a math project for tenth grade students based on sixth grade math because that is way below them.  With teacher designed-projects they are more likely to have realistic amount of work and would be possible for students to complete and meet the goal at the end of the break, teachers would most definitely not give too much work to overburden students since they also need some rest or too little work to students but give them just enough work for the break. But if student-designed projects are used students are more likely to create very short and straight to the point projects because most students are lazy and just do not want to be bothered with any work so would not want to challenge themselves to research and do more but would want very few questions that would not need any serious thinking and application of knowledge. A teacher who teaches a 12th grade English class could give a summer project for students to read and summarize a book of their choice and find out the meanings of 20 new words in the book but students would have probably wanted a project where they just write out ten new words from the book they read.  Every student always wants the easy way out of everything so if allowed to create a summer project would just create a project based on what they are very good at for example; a project with artwork, a crossword puzzle or a project about their own sentences and this would lead to a disagreement among the students to pick the best project which would be good for everyone. However, a teacher would not be biased in choosing a summer project for their students, they would assign a project based on skills all their students are expected to know or already have without picking out what some particular people would want in that class.  Ultimately, teachers know the best approaches and methods when it comes to projects for their students because they have worked with many different students over the years and came up with very effective teacher-designed summer projects to help their students keep learning over the break without stressing them.   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†		0
To my state senator, i feel like you should keep the electoral college because it helps kids in college figure out how the election goes and for them to vote. " the electoral college process consists of 538 electors." the only way people can vote is when there 18 and thats not right i think 15 and up should be able to vote, i guess its the law how people gotta wait till there 18 to vote for presidents and senators and stuff like that. "under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the electoral college". they should be able to use a popular vote to, if you be fair to one you gotta be fair to the other one.  "ths year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency! the are too many broken down states with a electoral vote!!! they easily choose a state and send a lot of votes to them !!!!    		0
Dear principal,  The idea kind of sounds unfair to others students that have D' s and F' s . I think kids with any grade point average or letter grade can participate in the sport they want to participate in. It would be really unfair to those who have the other two grades that can't participate in the sport they want to do for a school activity and for extra sports activity for their school to help support it in any way they can. Still students should have fun when they want to or not it would be fair to them if you just give us a chance to work hard and be healthy students that do whatever it takes to raise our grades to straight A' s or B' s and to achieve what we want to achieve. We want to fulfill our dreams and get a career like a teacher, pet doctor, doctor, designer, pet seller, or a famous singer/ dancer. One day we will have those dreams because of education and exercise. So let us have exercise when we have D' s and F' s at least we try so hard to get so far and at least we get somewhere in life when we are adults. When we look back we will remember the school that let us participate in sports and any other activity we want to support the school and any other kid in need. I almost fulfilled my dreams by exercise with my school and so far I am as healthy as a horse. I haven't been sick at least once in while but I am still hanging on to my dream being like my hero Michael Jackson. He inspired me to dance and sing like him and to never stop what you believe in. So no matter what grade health matters to us and the whole entire human race of the Earth.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
This artical shows that Dr. Huang could maybe idntify human emotions on an computer, but they would have to scan your face to prove exactly what you might be feeling. They use Leonardo da Vincie's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa -- as an example; when they do this they say that she is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry. But, How could a computer read your emoitions? Could we really ues this in a classroom to help identify students emotions lke they did in Leonardo da  Vincie's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa --. In the aritcal it says that this computer could see if a student is confused or bored. Dr. Huang predicts "That it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.", but if this computer is doing all of this then would there be a need for schools or teachers. This new tecnology is making as though this emotion reading computer could be placed in you're home and then you're children could just learn there. THe reason i say this is because if it can tell when a student is bored or confused then what would happen if the other students are getting it then it changes just so one student could understand it. Would that confuse the other students, or would it help everyone in the long run? Maybe they do have a good idea and maybe it really could help., but I also this it could hurt as well. It could put school teachers out of a jod. this computer could making it to were there is no need for schools because this computer could be instaled into your house and your childeren could just learn at home. Along with them learning at home this computer could tell them other ways to understand the work by reading their facsal expretions and emotions.     		0
Sitting at a desk for seven straight hours is outrageous. It's difficult for students who have a short attention span to maintain focus in school and acquire all of the information they've learned from their teachers. This issue, however, has¬†been significantly resolved¬†by the impact of technology on education. Some schools give students the opportunity to attend classes and learn by accessing through an online medium from home. This way, students can manage their time wisely to not only gain focus from breaks but also other acquire benefits that could improve their life. Because students can have time to partake in valuable activities that could positively influence their college admissions and are enabled to improve their health, all without losing the motivation to learn, distance learning from home through online or video conferencing gives students a greater advantage over learning in physical classrooms from time management.  Online school stimulates students to participate in valuable activities, such as volunteering for the good of the community, acquiring a paying job to support their family's income, and getting an internship, since they are able to have free time from controlling their time properly. All of these aspects can help colleges to understand the students' personality to determine whether or not to have them to become a part of their institutions. For example, the University of Virginia would rather accept a high school student who had an internship in a medical field that they immensely wish to pursue than accept a student who had no exposure or experience in the medical field. This is because the college admissions can see the student's determination and confidence in oneself. As a result, the student who had a medical internship would have a very high chance of being hired as a physician assistant, for instance, once he or she is completed earning a medical degree from UVA. This illustrates how much an impact online schools can have on the future lives of high school students, by giving students an opportunity to manage their time properly to convince college to see the good side of them.  Despite that, online classes also gives students another advantage: sleep--the most fundamental aspect in a high school student's mental life. It's vital to understand that sleep allows students to be productive and energized to perform various tasks throughout their school day. However, preparing for physical school limits their amount of sleep. For instance, many high school girls take a long duration of time to in the morning to put on makeup, shower, critically match their outfit for the day, etc., for school, so they decide to wake up early to complete all of those tasks. This proves that these actions can reduce a tremendous amount of time of their sleep to get ready for school. On the other hand, the ability to stay in and attend classes online excuses students from doing all of these time-consuming tasks to get a sufficient amount of sleep. They can simply wake up and attend school with a click of a button.  Some critics may say that online classes encourage students to cheat during assessments, using their online resources without having supervisors to stop them. This causes them to lose motivation in learning. However, some schools require them to take their assessments in person which will thus motivate students to learn for their own good. For example, Generic_City Public Schools give students an opportunity to take certain courses online but require students to take their midterms and finals in person at a designated school with the students' online teacher. This way, students are unable to cheat during their exams as their teacher is constantly paying close attention of their actions, thus motivating them to discipline themselves and ensure that they are learning what they need to learn for their own benefit.  As students are able to manage their time wisely, attending online classes from home is tremendously beneficial for students, due to being able to have a healthier body and use their free time on important tasks that can help them build an attractive portfolio for colleges. It's crucial to understand that not only their education is important but also the students' life, including their future. Furthermore, high school students should take advantage of the new technology that the world has provided us, especially by taking certain classes online. Technology is constantly changing to make our lives easier, so it's reasonable to take advantage of what technology has given us.		0
Have you ever wanted to stay home and learn in your pajamas? Well, with distance learning, that is possible! I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it can help students who might be struggling socially or mentally, can be great for students who come from a background of poverty or complicated family life, and can create an environment that would fill the needs and preferences of some students.  Being given the opportunity to work from home will prove to be hugely beneficial to students who struggle socially or mentally in their daily lives. Problems at school, such as bullying or lack of friends (leading to loneliness), can reflect poorly on a students' grades. If a student is constantly worried about their bullies or is always trying to "fit in", they will put less time into studying for school and their grades could drop significantly. Likewise, many high schoolers deal with mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Being able to work in the comfort of their own home would eliminate the possible cause of the problem and allow the student time to focus on themselves, which could result in the improvement of their mental health. For example, a student with high levels of anxiety might be too anxious in school to show their full potential. Working from home, however, would allow them to fully express themselves in their education.  Doing school from home would also benefit students who come from a background of poverty or have some sort of complicated family life that requires their parents to work a lot. Although we don't always think of it, even public schools can be expensive or challenging for families stuck deep in poverty. Gas money, lunch money, and money for the students' clothing or special events, like field trips, all add up over time. While parents could save gas money by making their children take the bus to school, this is not always a reliable method of transportation, especially in poorer areas. I grew up and went to school in downtown Detroit. The bus system there was terrible, unreliable, and often times unsafe; many parents preferred to drive their children to school or have them walk. For poorer families who live in districts outside of the bus route, their children being given the opportunity to work from home would save them time and gas money. Working from home would also eliminate the need for the student to dress "fashionably", as they could just wear whatever they wanted, which would save poorer families a lot of money on clothing.  Distance learning also creates an environment that fills the needs and preferences of some students. For example, a lot of students struggle with severe or mild A.D.H.D., a problem that affects a student's ability to remain focused for an extended amount of time. Working from home would take away distractions and allow a student to devote their full attention to their schooling. Being distracted in class can bring down grades significantly, and there are a lot of things that can be distracting during the school day. Learning from home also allows students to travel. A couple of years ago, my parents' job forced them to travel constantly. At the time, me and my siblings were too young to be on our own for long, so they had to bring us along with them on their travels. Online schooling proved to be extremely beneficial during this time, because we could study and do school as we were travelling and at a speed that proved most beneficial to us. Online schooling allows for a student to go at their own pace rather than struggling to keep up with the rest of the class.  While there are a lot of benefits to distance learning, critics might point out that there are also some negatives. Working from home takes away the social aspect of school that is so important to teenagers and makes it harder for students to be connected and involved in the community. Although online schooling does limit the social life of a student, it does not completely eliminate it, and some students who might struggle with depression or social anxiety would prefer to learn in a more isolated environment where they can feel relaxed. Distance learning is also just giving students an opportunity to work from home; this does not mean that the students have to use it. If a student is having a bad day, is sick, or is travelling, distance learning might be the most beneficial way to keep up with their education.  In conclusion, I think distance learning is a beneficial idea because it would help students who are struggling mentally and socially or who come from a poor or complicated family life and creates an environment that would fill the needs of any student.¬†		0
Have you ever wanted to know if you can tell if someone is forcing a smile or a real smile? I agree with the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. By using this technology you can tell how your friends, parents, and even teachers are feeling.  To begin with, You wake up for school and your mom is already making breakfast for you, but you dont know how she was feeling. When you come in the room she would erase "that" expression and greet you with a smile like usual. Didnt you wish you could tell how she was feeling and do something to make her feel better? With the FACS you can. 60 percent tired, 25 percent happy, 10 percent sad, and 5 percent angry. So you hug her and tell her to go back to sleep, then you go to school.  In the meantime, you arrive at school and meet up with your friends, but you could tell that one of them isnt as "energized" as usual. You would ask them whats wrong and they would probably say "nothing" and force a smile. You know that they arent feeling great but you dont want to nag them as well. So then you would use FACS. 90 percent depressed, 2 percent happy, 5 percent tired, and 3 percent angry. You can then calculate that they are depressed because of family problem or school.  Last but not least, according to the article "we humans perform this same impressive ¬ìcalculation¬î every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face". Using the technology of FACS can help you "calculate" your friend or parent feeling.  Inconclusion, FACS is a technology that allows you to read people feelings and mood. What if your friend is feeling depressed and dont want to live anymore? With FACS you can help them and prevent suicide. FACS can help you "calculate" your friend or parent feeling.		0
Sure, here is my essay response:  As an 8th grader, I am currently taking a variety of classes that are helping me prepare for my future. In my freshman year, I took classes such as math, English, science, and social studies. These classes were really important because they helped me develop my problem-solving skills, improve my writing and reading abilities, and learn about different historical events and scientific concepts.  During my sophomore year, I continued to take these core classes, but I also started to explore other subjects that interest me, such as foreign language and art. I found these classes to be really fun and engaging, and they helped me learn new skills and perspectives.  In my junior year, I plan to take even more classes that challenge me and help me grow as a student. I am interested in taking a class on computer science, as I think it will be really cool to learn about programming and how computers work. I am also considering taking a class on environmental science, as I am passionate about protecting the planet and learning about sustainable practices.  To make sure I am completing all of my course work and staying on top of my classes, I make sure to pay attention in class and take detailed notes. I also complete any assigned work outside of class and turn it in on time. I know that staying organized and motivated is key to success in high school, and I am committed to putting in the effort to achieve my goals.  If I need help with any of my classes, I don't hesitate to visit my teacher. They are always willing to provide extra support and answer any questions I may have. I know that my teachers are there to help me, and I appreciate their dedication and hard work.  Overall, I am excited to continue learning and growing as a student throughout my high school career. I know that it will be a challenge, but I am up for it and I am confident that I will be able to achieve my goals with hard work and determination.		1
 Car-free cities. In recent years, the idea of living in a city where cars are banned and people rely on alternative modes of transportation has gained popularity. In fact, car-free cities have become a reality in some locations around the world. The benefits of car-free cities include improved air and noise pollution, reduced traffic congestion, and a healthier population. In this essay, we will explore the advantages of these cities and examine the measures taken by governments to implement this policy.  One of the most significant advantages of car-free cities is the reduction in air pollution. Cars are one of the biggest contributors to pollution, and by removing them from the streets, cities can significantly reduce their carbon footprint. In fact, studies have shown that air quality improves in as little as a few weeks after cars are banned from a city.  Noise pollution is another problem associated with cars. Cars produce a lot of noise, and this can have a detrimental effect on the health and well-being of people living in a city. By removing cars from the streets, cities can reduce noise levels and create a more peaceful environment for their citizens.  Another advantage of car-free cities is the reduction in traffic congestion. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of traffic congestion on roads, and removing them from the streets means that there is less traffic, and therefore less congestion. This can improve travel times for people using alternative modes of transportation, such as bikes or public transportation.  Finally, car-free cities can lead to a healthier population. Walking and biking are both excellent forms of exercise, and by encouraging people to use these modes of transportation, cities can promote a healthier lifestyle. This can lead to a reduction in obesity, heart disease, and other health problems associated with a sedentary lifestyle.  However, implementing a car-free city policy is not as simple as banning cars outright. Governments must consider the needs of their citizens and ensure that alternative modes of transportation are available. For example, if people rely on their cars for work, the government must provide them with some form of transportation that allows them to get to work.  In addition, the ban on cars must be phased in gradually. This means that the government must work to encourage people to use alternative modes of transportation before outright banning cars. This will give people time to adjust and adapt to the new policy.  Finally, there must be some way to compensate people who have to depend on cars. This could be in the form of public subsidies or tax incentives for people who purchase electric or hybrid cars, for example.  In conclusion, car-free cities have many advantages, including improved air and noise pollution, reduced traffic congestion, and a healthier population. Governments must consider the needs of their citizens and ensure that alternative modes of transportation are available before implementing a car-free city policy. However, with careful planning and implementation, car-free cities could be an excellent solution to some of the world's biggest problems.		1
Why should we limit our uses on car usages, some people se the limiting of car usage as less tense. " When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" said heidrun Walter, a mother of two. when you have a car you'll have to find space for it as well as a house to buy. There are only two places to park at the edge of a development, where a car-owner has to pay $40,000, along with a home. passenger cars are responcible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United states. with less cars people have the advantages of being a walk away from a store instead of a highway. With less cars that give off gas emissions the less our ozone will deplete. More and more people are using hybrid cars because they dont give off as much gas emissions than regular cars that take diesel. Depending on the weather of the night and day could really effect the greenhouse effect of our planet. If ther was a cold night and a warm day this could help the warmer layer of air to trap the car emissions, which depletes the ozone layer that is protecting our planet.  Paris one of the most leading countries in the world with the car emissions ended making people stop using their cars because of all the smog that was¬† being created. People who used their cars were fined $31 and if they complained about that their car would somethimes be towed away. While the rule of no cars was in effect the traffic jams in france were down over 60 percent. Think about what this could do to the United States. The smog had cleard so much that Paris eventually allowed odd numbered plates to drive again on Tuesday. " 'It's a good oppourtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution'¬† said Carlos Arturo as he rode with his wife on a two seat bicycle" ( Andrew Selsky, Source 3). The no car rule is sweeping over the nations, because of this rule there has been over 118 miles of bicycle paths in Bogota, Colombia.  " Municipal athorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic 'These poeple are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders' Said Enrique Riera, the mayor of asuncion, Paraguay. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly down by 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January of 1995. Part of the explantion lies in the recession, because cash- strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unimployed weren't going to¬† work anyway. These people could not afford cars but they could have afforded a bike if they wanted to. They could have rode to work on a bike or could have tried to find a job on a bike it's that people are starting to get to lazy to do important things like ride a bike. With cars theres gas you have to pay for along with the insurence, that's a lot of money.  Lucky for us Americas love affair twords vehicles seem to be coling down. When the number of child growth grew, the number of miles driven dropped steadly down in 2005. With cars the rodes are more dangerous anything could happen to anyone or anything. The percentage of 16-39 year olds that are driving dropped, while older people retain thweir licenses as they age. A study last year was found tha driving by younger people dropped by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Bill Ford proposed partnering with telecommunactions industrys to create cities in which " pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improive safety". In Germeny the banning of cars resulted that 70 percent of families donot have cars, and 57 perecnt sold a car to move there. In doing all of these thing this could help stop the greenhouse effect on our planet and start saving it insted of killing it.       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†¬†¬†¬†       ¬†¬†¬†¬†    		0
Dear Principal,  I agree that students should have atleast a B average to join a sports team. I agree with your decision because students will keep their grades up to join, they can join in high school and be prepared, and students will have the chance to do something they like at a cheaper price. But I disagree with your decision also because if a student has a D in p. e., they can join a sports team at school for extra credit in p. e. and anyways, most students have a C average. So wouldn't that be a good idea?  So I agree with your decision because of three main reasons: students will keep their grades high to join, students can try out at high school and be prepared for it, and its cheaper for a student to join at school instead of signing up for a league. What I mostly like about this decision is that its cheaper at a school, but you still get the uniforms and trophies and things like you would get at the league, only cheaper!  Although on the other hand, I disagree with your decision mainly because students can play a sport for extra credit in p. e. and most students have a C average. It would really encourage students to join and raise their grades. It is also better this way so that students playing sports at school can earn more money for the school. So that is why I disagree with your decision.  So wouldn't it be better for the school if we started sports teams? It is an easy way to make money for the school, and students can earn extra credit and still keep their grades up while having fun!		0
 Recently, a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) has become more popular in the field of computer science. The system enables computers to identify and interpret human emotions based on the analysis of facial micro-expressions. While there are many potential uses for this technology, one possibility that has been proposed is using FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. In this essay, I will argue that the use of FACS in this way is valuable.  Firstly, it is important to understand how FACS works. Developed by Paul Ekman, FACS is a system for identifying six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, sadness, fear, anger, and disgust - through the analysis of a person's facial movements. By examining the subtle details of a person's expression, such as the width and shape of their eyes, the position and movement of their eyebrows and facial muscles, FACS can accurately identify and categorize the emotional state of a person.  One potential benefit of using FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is that it could help teachers better understand their students' feelings and emotions. By analyzing the facial expressions of their students, teachers could gain insight into what is working and what is not in terms of their teaching methods, classroom environment, or curriculum. For example, if the students are consistently showing signs of frustration or disappointment during a particular activity, this could indicate that the activity is not engaging or effective.  Additionally, FACS could also help teachers better identify and support students who may be struggling emotionally. For example, if a student is consistently showing signs of sadness or depression, this could indicate that they may need additional support or resources from teachers or counselors. By using FACS to identify these students, teachers could potentially intervente early and prevent serious emotional issues from developing.  Of course, there are also potential risks and challenges associated with the use of FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. For example, there is the risk that students may feel uncomfortable or self-conscious being constantly monitored in this way, potentially leading to negative psychological effects. Additionally, there is the risk that the system may not work accurately or reliably in all cases, potentially leading to false readings or misinterpretation of students' emotions.  Overall, while there are certainly risks and challenges associated with the use of FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, I believe that the benefits of this technology far outweigh the risks. By helping teachers better understand their students' feelings and emotions, and intervene early to support		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I, STUDENT_NAME, think you make it so that every student is required to complete a certain amount of community service each semester. Students need to learn that not everybody is as lucky as them, and that there are many people out there that don't have a home or food to eat. Students need to give back to the community.  Children these days take many things for granted, such as the house they live in or the food they eat. They don't realize there are many civilians out in the world that have no home, no food, and nobody to help them. Many people/children turn the other way when they see these people, choosing their own selfish needs over these helpless people in need of food and a place to stay. Students would rather spend time at the mall or playing video games instead of helping out the community by picking up litter or visiting a nursing home.  It is up to TEACHER_NAME to require these students to give back to the community, to open their eyes to the world around them. By making these students do community service you are giving them the gift of knowledge. The students will be less ignorant and not take things for granted such as their education. The students will have a new found knowledge of the homeless, the poor, and the starving, and many will go on and do more than required. They will go above and beyond and raise money, go to nursing homes, and help out at soup kitchens. All thanks to you TEACHER_NAME, for requiring them to do community service. This will also make the students want to strive for greater goals in life in order to help the needy even more. They will not take their education for granted and work hard for good grades.  You have a decision to make TEACHER_NAME, whether to require students to do community service or not require it, but I highly recommend you to require it. So that the students will become less ignorant and not take things for granted. So that they learn life lessons, and strive for greatness. If you choose to require the community service you choose to make a better, brighter future for these students!      		0
Attitude is a crucial aspect of success in life. It refers to a person's mental state and their approach to different situations. Attitude can be positive or negative, and it can greatly impact a person's ability to achieve their goals and reach their full potential. In the workplace, school, and at home, attitude plays a significant role in determining success.  In the workplace, attitude is essential for achieving success. A positive attitude can help employees stay motivated and focused on their tasks, leading to increased productivity and better job performance. It can also help employees build positive relationships with their colleagues and superiors, leading to more opportunities for career advancement. On the other hand, a negative attitude can lead to decreased productivity, missed deadlines, and strained relationships with colleagues and superiors.  In school, attitude is also crucial for success. Students with a positive attitude are more likely to engage in class, ask questions, and participate in extracurricular activities. They are also more likely to perform well on exams and assignments, leading to better grades and a higher likelihood of graduating. A negative attitude, on the other hand, can lead to disengagement, missed opportunities, and lower grades.  At home, attitude is also important for success. A positive attitude can help individuals maintain a healthy and productive lifestyle, leading to better physical and mental health. It can also help individuals build positive relationships with family members and friends, leading to a more fulfilling and happy life. A negative attitude, on the other hand, can lead to stress, conflict, and a lack of motivation.  In conclusion, attitude is an important aspect of success in life. It plays a significant role in the workplace, school, and at home. A positive attitude can lead to increased productivity, better relationships, and a more fulfilling life, while a negative attitude can lead to decreased productivity, missed opportunities, and a lack of motivation. It is important for individuals to recognize the importance of attitude and make a conscious effort to maintain a positive attitude in all aspects of their lives.		1
 Dear Senator,   I am writing to you today to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to instead elect the president by a popular vote of the American people. While the Electoral College was established by the Founding Fathers with the aim of having each state's influence matched to their population, in the modern era it has led to results that seem unrepresentative of the will of the people.   One argument often made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign across more states. However, research showed that in recent elections, candidates tended to focus their efforts only in swing states that could potentially vote either way. This means that citizens in solidly red or blue states feel their votes do not truly matter. A popular vote system may encourage candidates to campaign across the entire nation to try and win over more total voters.   It is also often pointed out that the popular vote winner has failed to become president in two of the last five elections. This resulted in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. In a democracy, one would expect that the candidate preferred by a plurality, or ideally a majority, of citizens would become the leader. Some argue this flaw in the current system could undermine confidence in elections. A popular vote would align the outcome with the will of the actual voting public.  Of course, switching to a popular vote also presents challenges. It may mean some smaller states feel their distinct interests are less represented. However, all citizens' voices would carry equal weight in determining the outcome. A nationwide popular vote could help address perceptions that some citizens' votes essentially do not count under the current system. Given the major flaws that have appeared in recent elections, it is time to seriously consider updating how we elect the president to better reflect core democratic principles. For all these reasons, I believe transitioning to a popular vote would be preferable. Thank you for your consideration of this important issue.  Sincerely, [Your name]		1
It is important to always be yourself and never let others influence who you are. We each have our own gifts and talents that we should be proud of. When we give in to the opinions and pressures of others, we are not being true to ourselves. It is our job to be confident in our own abilities and to know that our paths are unique to us.   A great real-life example of this is Ariana Grande. She did not let the pressure of the music industry shape her talent or who she is as a person. She was true to herself, her sound, and her style, staying true to the core of what makes her unique and is now one of the most successful singers of our time.   It is also important to remember that life will have its difficult days, but if you remain confident in your abilities and keep yourself true to who you are, you can push through anything. Being yourself will lead to growth, greater self-awareness, and the confidence to truly stand out and make your own mark in the world. So never give up, never lose sight of who you are, and always remember to be yourself.		1
 It's no secret that many people now rely on technology for social interaction, rather than face-to-face communication. The rise of social media and other digital platforms has made it easier than ever to connect with others, regardless of where they are in the world. However, this convenience comes at a cost. Research has shown that excessive use of technology can lead to depression, as well as a host of other negative effects on mental and physical health.  One of the most concerning aspects of technology use is its impact on our brains. Studies have shown that spending too much time on screens can lead to a decline in cognitive function, including memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. In addition, staring at screens for long periods of time can cause eye strain and even lead to vision problems.  Another downside of technology is that it can make us lazy. Instead of actively engaging with the world around us, we rely on technology to do our work for us. For example, instead of going outside and playing sports, many people spend their free time sitting in front of screens, scrolling through social media or playing video games.  It's important to strike a balance between using technology and engaging in other activities. While technology can be a useful tool for communication, learning, and entertainment, it should not be our primary means of interaction. By limiting our use of technology and making a conscious effort to engage with the world around us, we can improve our mental and physical health, and lead more fulfilling lives.		1
In this article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author gives many details throughout this text as to why he believes that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. Given these details, he uses useful information that we need to know. In the first paragraph he describes what Venus actually is. If he wasn't to do that, people might be misleaded and still assume that Venus could perhaps be a star. The author gives very useful information to describe what Venus is. An example would be, "Often reffered to as "Earth's Twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, occasionally the closest in distance too."  The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports their claim by giving numerous details and supporting his ideas."Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endbeavors." A big issue that is brought up are the harsh conditions Venus brings. "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." Knowing this, you might think that they must stop there with their research because there's no way they can discover Venus now because it's to dangerous and harsh. That is false, "NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray." Their solution is to have a vehicle hovering over Venus that would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. It would still be toasty but not deathly. The author claims, " Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." The author supports his claim by saying yes, the temperature is a challenge they will face, but NASA has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, and they will continue to challenge themselves and find solutions to these conflicts they face.  The author mentions, "More importantly, researchers cannot takes samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance." Although this may be a challenge, the author states that many researchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to their knowledge of Venus. In paragraph 7, it states that NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, and that it is possible and worthy of doing so. One project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. "By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces." The author does a good job by using details to support that although this is a challenge, they are willing to dive deeper into studying this "Evening Star" known as Venus.  In coclusion, the authors final claim states, "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." Although there are many dangers that could seek upon them, they take them as "challenges" and are willing to dig deeper to find out why Venus is the way it is. "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system." Therefore, this is why the author does a good job by suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.    		0
Nowadays does everyone rely on cars frequently, and as of late has this practise begun to show its numerous negative effects, of which shall be discussed. The articles presented by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robbert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky portray the effects of such frequent use of cars and effort many areas are already making to limit car usage the articles also explore the many benefits of limiting car usage such as reduction of pollution.  Some large and global cities, such as Paris, are known for the substantial amount of pollution present in their air. According to Source 2: "Paris bans drivin due to smog", Paris already has more smog than other European capitals in general with one hundred fortyseven micrograms of particulate matter per one cubic metre. In comparison to brussels one hundred fourteen micrograms and London's seventynine and seven tenths, Paris' pollution is clearly more concentrated. According to Source 4: "The End of Car Culture" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the United States features broad expanses and many suburbs, being one of the places in the world where cars are greatly centred upon by the people. Thus can one imagine the exceptionally negative impact that cars most likely have on the air quality of the urban and suburban areas throughout the United States. Elizabeth Rosenthal's Source 1: "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" states that the widespread use of automobiles worldwide are one of the greatest obstacles to overcome in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles. Twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are from cars and even up to fifty percent are from cars in the United States. This furthermore leads on to the many benefits that limits on car usage have to offer and the efforts certain areas are making to create these benefits.  Source 1 provides some useful insight efforts on the possibilities and advantages of limiting car use over continuing the mainstream automobile trend. Vauban is a community in Germany near France and Switzerland, on the outskirts of Freiburg. Here is where parking areas in streets, driveways, and home garages are infrequent to find or are outright forbidden. Only two places are available for parking, which are the large garages at the edge of the community, with parking spaces going out for forty thousand dollars. In Vauban, only thirty percent of the population own cars, and fiftyseven percent of people sold their cars in order to move here. Apparently, the lack of automobiles seems to have a calming effect as is professed by Heidrun Walter, who is quoted from Source 1: "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Source 2 show how Paris had to create a driving ban temporarily due to smog. Car traffic was lowered to sixty percent in Paris after a week of the smog and the ban helped to clear this outbreak so commuting could resume to its regular ways without impediment from the heavy pollution. Andrew Selsky's Source 3: "Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota", Bogota of Colombia had a day imposed where cars were banned and only buses and taxis were permitted. This was imposed to support alternative transportation as well as to reduce the amount of smog in the city, similar to the ban Paris has imposed. Although there was rain that same day, it did not stop people from participating, and similar to Heidrun Walter's comment in Source 1, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states that "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." The campaign for these Days Without Cars began in the mid1990s and has resulted in construction of one hundred eighteen bicycle paths and major public work repairs of sidewalks and blooming of parks and sports centers. Restrictions imposed during rushhour have reduced traffic greatly in a positive way and new shopping districts and restaurants are appearing constantly. Even in the great urban automobile centres of America, vehicle use seems to be reducing, as presented in Source 4. Acording to an analysis by Doug Short, a member of an investment research company called Advisor Perspectives, miles driven in the United States has slowly fallen since 2005 it is apparent that if the pattern continues, carbon emissions and the environment will be positively impacted to a substantial extent. Even Bill Ford, CEO of the Ford Motor Company, has porposed a business plan for a world in which ownership of a vehicle is undesirable, a place where walking, biking, low use of private cars, and public transportation is woven together to conserve resources, decrease emissions, and increase the level of urban safety.  As shown, such a level of car limitation would be highly beneficial to everyone as a whole. There would be less pollution, driving would be safer, and the urban economy would spring as more people walk or bike to transport themselves. Bill Ford's idea of a world where owning a car is impractical would be highly viable, and the city of Vauban has already begun the move. Areas without choking pollution, congested traffic, and a simpler and more tranquil life overall result from the restriction of car usage.		0

School is something that almost everyone goes through, so why is it that if someone misses a day they just fall behind? Being able to take a class online would fix this, when a student misses a day they can turn to the lesson online, instead of waiting until their next class to try and catch up. There are many students who miss a lot of school, for several reasons, the top reasons are for sports, sickness, or vacations. There are also many students who get injured, though they can still come to school, it may be hard for them to get around, and would be easier for them to stay at home.  Many student-athletes, like myself, happen to miss a lot of school for their sport. Most sports require a lot of traveling, especially when competing at higher levels. Tournaments can be long sometimes, and then a day of the tournament may fall on a school day, and students usually leave for a tournament the day before, depending on how far the destination is they may leave earlier. Personally I miss quite a bit for tournaments, especially when they're every weekend and Im having to leave early. Some of my classes I fall behind in, because there isn't really a chance for me to come in to make up the material, when both me and the teacher are busy. Online classes would allow me the chance to make up the classes I missed during a break, or if available, download it for the trip to the tournament, or back from the tournament.  In Spider-Man Homecoming, the main character, Peter Parker, happens to accidentally miss quite a bit of school. He travels a lot in the movie and appears worried when realizing he's going to miss school. Though it doesn't show whether or not he does have the option to make up his classes online, its implied that he is going to get behind from missing a day or two of school. The movie shows how worried he was over missing a few days of school, he panicked a little when he thought about it, if he had the option to make it up online though, he probably wouldn't have been panicking over it so much. Allowing students to make up classes they miss online, would avoid them falling behind, they also wouldnt stress over when they would get the chance to make up the work.  In Harry Potter, though they might not have the technology at the time, it seems that each class they learn a lot, so if a student misses, then they're just super far behind. In this case being able to do the lesson online would allow for the students to never fall behind the rest of their class. Though there are some teachers that prefer getting to teach a student that missed their class, there are many that don't have the time for that, as well as students who can't make it in early or stay late sometimes. Allowing the student to complete the lesson online, saves both the student and teacher some time, though the student may have questions after since they can't ask during the lesson, they could still ask once they go back to school, or email their teacher.  Though there are people who say that it's best for students to learn at school, because they can ask their teachers and other students for help. Online school doesn't really allow students to collaborate with each other, but there are many student's who learn better that way. Also, if a student is to miss school, at least¬†they have the online class to refer to, instead of just falling behind.  I believe that schools should offer online classes, as it seems like it would help any students who miss lots of school to stay caught up. Sports and getting sick are only two things that can cause a student to miss school, there are many more reasons that a student may miss, such as vacations that people may go on early. There are also students who get sick really easily or are accident prone, allowing them a chance to do their work online helps to make sure that they dont fall behind. Online school would minimize the amount of work a student has to make up when they get back, and allow the student to enjoy their time more, instead of worrying about school constantly.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
I'm ready to start planning for a successful school year and my goals are clear: I want to learn, excel academically, and achieve greatness. My first goal for the school year is to become an honor roll student. To help me reach this goal, I need to create a plan of action that I can stick to.   I've been inspired by Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement, "To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived: this is to have succeeded." It serves as a reminder for me to strive for the highest in personal accomplishment and growth.   Additionally, my cousin has been remarkably successful in managing her time to complete challenging course work. I'm inspired by her dedication and hard work, and have set realistic goals for myself that reflect the same commitment and focus. By setting clear goals and diligently following a plan of action, I am confident I can achieve a successful school year.		1
People should not be able to use their phones while driving under any circumstances. Many people would agree that it shouldn't be allowed to use phones while driving, due to the distraction from the road, and gives you less time to react if something happens. Using a phone while driving brings more dangers to one of the most dangerous and daily tasks of a regular person.  Using your phone while driving is a distraction from the road which is really dangerous not just for the driver but those around the car. In many cases of car accidents are caused by distracted driving with phones and this is most common with teens. These car accidents aren't just dangerous for those involved but can also cause death in many incidents.  Another reason why people shouldn't use their phone while driving is because, it would give the driver shorter time to react if something happened such as a pedestrian running into the street because if you hit them it will be the drivers fault and could get into legal trouble or worse yet the driver gets into a car crash and dies. People shouldn't use their phones because it only causes trouble.    		0
Technology has had a profound impact on people's lives in today's world. It has revolutionized the way people interact, make plans, and access information. With the advent of the internet, social media, and mobile devices, people can now connect with each other from anywhere in the world. This has opened up new opportunities for people to make friends, collaborate on projects, and share ideas.  One of the most significant positive effects of technology is the ability to access information easily. With just a few clicks, people can find answers to their questions, learn new things, and stay up-to-date on current events. Technology has also made it easier for people to learn new skills and pursue their interests, with online courses and educational resources available at their fingertips.  However, technology has also had some negative effects on people's lives. For example, excessive screen time can lead to eye strain, headaches, and poor sleep quality. Social media can also have a negative impact on people's mental health, leading to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. Furthermore, technology can be used illegally, such as hacking and cyberbullying, which can have serious consequences.  In terms of social lives, technology has made it easier for people to connect with each other, but it has also made it easier for people to isolate themselves. People can spend hours on social media, interacting with their screens rather than with real-life friends and family. This can lead to a sense of disconnection and loneliness, which can have negative impacts on mental health.  In terms of financial lives, technology has made it easier for people to access information and resources, but it has also created new challenges. For example, the rise of e-commerce has made it easier for people to shop online, but it has also made it easier for people to overspend and accumulate debt. Furthermore, the rise of automation and artificial intelligence has made it easier for companies to outsource jobs, leading to job loss and economic insecurity.  In terms of access to resources, technology has made it easier for people to access information and resources, but it has also created new challenges. For example, the rise of the gig economy has made it easier for people to access short-term gigs, but it has also created a lack		1
Do you know what the Electoral College is? It's a process that the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of President by a vote in Congress and election of President by popular vote of qualified citizens. I think that we should change the way we vote by changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. I feel that this is a good idea and a good way to vote, let me tell you why. It's a good idea because it benefits the public, everyone knows exactly what kind of impact they're making and so it doesn't mess up the votes and or voting. Let's continue, shall we?  It's a good idea because it benefits to the public. The public wants to know exactly who and what they are voting for, they want to know exactly what their vote means to the election. More than half of the time they don't notice what kind of an impact a vote can make or what exactly they are voting for. Also when they do elect a President, the end up getting mad over their finances or taxes because the President that they voted for affected it in a negative way. They wanted to elect him because they wanted a better economy, to benefit them, not to restrict them from not having what they want. This is only my first reason, I have two more to go.  Another reason of why I believe that it's a good idea is because it let's the public know what kind of impact they're exactly making on the election. We all don't want to vote and not know what kind of impact our vote can make. We want to know that we can make a difference on who we're voting for, or who we vote for. They want to know and be sure if they vote for lets say "Billy Henderson" that he will lower gas prices and boost the economy, make this world a better place and help all the needy, instead of "Robert Metinguey" who will maybe to this and maybe do that. We want to know for sure what we're voting on and how much of a difference it can make. Not to be worried about if it won't happen.  The last reason I have to give for why this a good idea is so that it does not mess up the voting process. According to the gallop pole in the 2,000, taken shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, won the popluar vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This is what im talking about people. People are losing their elections due to the electoral college. One of the major reasons of why people are wanting a change, there should be no electoral college, only a popular vote for the election. We all want a better Government. I only there was a better way to vote.  Well, there you have it. My reasons are final. I feel that we should change the voting process because it would benefit the public, so everyone can know exactly what kind of impact they're making and so it does not mess up the voting process. Don't do it for the government. Do it for your own sake. If you wanna make a difference, be on my side, and we can. Together.		0
In today's world, technology has become an integral part of our lives. It has allowed us to stay connected with friends and family, even from great distances. Technology has given us the tools to make lasting memories, access information that was unavailable to us in the past, and make plans with ease.   Additionally, technology has had a positive impact on our financial lives. From allowing people to shop and book flights with ease to providing inventive opportunities for new businesses to be created, technology has made financial transactions more efficient than ever before. People can also obtain resources faster than ever, from a variety of different sources.  On the other hand, technology also presents some drawbacks. Privacy concerns have been brought to the forefront and individuals are actively taking steps to protect their personal information from being exposed. It has also had serious implications on people's social lives, from social media addiction to potentially harmful interactions such as cyberbullying. Finally, technology can be used both legally and illegally, and it is important to be aware of the consequences of misuse.  While there are potential risks associated with technology, it has certainly been beneficial to humanity in many ways. With proper precautions, technology can continue to be used in beneficial ways for the benefit of all.		1
 Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can significantly improve the environment and quality of life for individuals and communities. One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to air pollution, and reducing the number of cars on the road can significantly reduce emissions. In addition, limiting car usage can also improve public health by reducing air pollution and promoting physical activity.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. Cars are a major source of traffic congestion, and reducing the number of cars on the road can significantly reduce congestion. This can improve traffic flow, reduce travel times, and improve the overall driving experience.  In addition to reducing emissions and congestion, limiting car usage can also promote sustainable transportation options. This can include public transportation, biking, and walking. These options can be more environmentally friendly, reduce traffic congestion, and provide individuals with more control over their transportation options.  However, there are some potential counterarguments to limiting car usage. For example, some individuals may argue that they need their cars for work or other important activities. While this is a valid concern, there are alternative transportation options available, such as public transportation or car-sharing programs. In addition, some individuals may argue that they enjoy driving and do not want to give it up. While this is also a valid concern, there are other activities and hobbies that individuals can pursue instead of driving.  Overall, the advantages of limiting car usage are significant and can have a positive impact on the environment, public health, and sustainable transportation options. While there may be some counterarguments, individuals and communities should consider the many benefits of limiting car usage and explore alternative transportation options.		1
Viking 1 photo was taken in 1976 and had people believing all sorts of things. It apperred to be a human face, but was not yet proven to be one. Some belived that is was just a natural landform, but which one is it? This mask on Mars was soon unmasked on May 24, 2001, and is proven to be a natural landform. They have used better pictures and comparison from Earth.  Using pictures to discorver the "Face on Mars" was difficult in 1976 because we did not have high tech cameras to prove anything, but as the years gone by we could soon tell the truth. For example, 22 years later Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) was able to take a picture of the figure ten times sharper. After this picture was taken, more people were able to believe that this mask on Mars was just natural landform. Then 3 years later in 2001 we had taken another picture that was even closer and it diffinetly showed landform.  Yes, the "Face on Mars" was discorvered to be a mesa, or landforms common around the American West. With all these pictures from 1976 to 2001, we had compared them to these Earth landforms. For example, Garvin says that it reminds him of most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.  This mysterious figure on Mars had turned out to be just natural landform called a mesa. The evidence and details have proven that through pictures and comparison. There is no longer a need to believe any alien monument or life on Mars. Sure, the viking 1 photo gave an illusion, but the MGS image from 2001 gives more evidence to what it really is. Thanks to Malin's teams, that caputured an extraodinary photo to prove the truth.		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I have been informed that you will be reviewing and choosing one of two policies regarding the subject of cell phone use in our school. The first is that you will permit students to have their phone in school to use them while they are at lunch and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. The second policy is that you will not permit students' cell phones to be at school at any time. I respect each policy and see the positives and negatives of both, but I believe that the first policy would be the better decision and benefit our school the most.  Although the world got along just fine without them before, cell phones have become a vital part of society today. Using a cell phone is a fast and easy way to communicate with others from anywhere around the globe. During school, sometimes you need to be in touch with someone about meeting up at lunch or what your plans are after school. Without cell phones, you would not be able to text or call this person, and it would be hard to make plans at all. Sure, some kids may just be texting their friends about some gossip, but that should not stop cell phones from being allowed to be used at school.  I know that I find myself needing to contact either one of parents about a ride home from school or a game being canceled often. There are land-line phones in classrooms, but teachers seldom allow you to use them to call home or another line unless there is an emergency. Without a mobile phone, you could not get in touch with your parents regarding an emergency or just something they need to know.  Finally, something that is very positive about the first policy is the last part, stating that all cell phones must be turned off during class time. I understand that phones can be very distracting during class when students are texting and not paying full attention to what the teachers are saying. Although it is fortunately rare, some students even text each other the answers to worksheets or tests and get away with it. This is completely inappropriate and should not be permitted in our school. That is another reason why I believe that the first policy is the better choice.  I believe that the first policy regarding cell phone use would be the most beneficial to our school and the students and teachers in it. Cell phones are important for contacting people such as peers or our parents during school. But, they should not be turned on during class time, as the policy entails. I think that most of my peers would agree with the position that I hold. I hope that you will consider my ideas and thoughts on why I believe the first policy is best.  Thank you,  STUDENT_NAME		0
 In recent years, the world has witnessed a growing trend towards limiting car usage. This trend is not only evident in Germany, but also in other countries such as France, Colombia, and the United States. By implementing low-car suburban life, cities have been able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create more compact and accessible public transportation systems. In this essay, I will argue that limiting car usage has several advantages, including reducing air pollution, promoting public transportation, and improving quality of life.  Firstly, reducing car usage can have a significant impact on air pollution. Cars are a major source of air pollution, as they emit harmful pollutants such as particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. According to the European Environment Agency, cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. In some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can even reach up to 50%. By limiting car usage, cities can significantly reduce air pollution and improve public health. For example, in Vauban, Germany, a car-free community that was completed in 2006, 70% of families do not own cars and 57% sold a car to move here. As a result, the community has seen a drastic reduction in air pollution.  Secondly, promoting public transportation can lead to a reduction in car usage. Public transportation systems such as buses, trains, and trams are more environmentally friendly than cars, as they emit fewer pollutants per passenger. By investing in public transportation systems, cities can encourage people to use these systems instead of driving their cars, reducing the number of cars on the road. This can also lead to a reduction in traffic congestion and a decrease in parking fees. For example, in Bogota, Colombia, the city has implemented a car-free day every year since 2008. During this day, the number of cars on the road is significantly reduced, leading to a decrease in air pollution and traffic congestion.  Thirdly, limiting car usage can improve quality of life. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities can create more pedestrian-friendly environments, making it easier for people to walk or cycle to their destinations. This can lead to a reduction in sedentary lifestyles and an increase in physical activity, which can have numerous health benefits. Additionally, by reducing traffic congestion and increasing the use of public transportation, cities can create more livable communities, with less noise and pollution, and more green spaces. For example, in Paris, France, the city implemented a partial driving ban in 2014, which led to a decrease in air pollution and an increase in green spaces in the city.  However, there are some counterclaims to limiting car usage. One major concern is the cost of implementing		1
  Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can improve the quality of life in urban areas. By examining the evidence from the provided passage set, we can see that car-free cities, reduced emissions, and alternative transportation options can lead to a healthier and more sustainable environment.  Firstly, car-free cities have shown to improve air quality and reduce smog. In Vauban, Germany, for instance, there are no private cars allowed, and the streets are designed for pedestrians and cyclists. As a result, the air is cleaner, and the residents are healthier. Similarly, in Paris, France, the government enforced a partial driving ban during days with high pollution levels, leading to a significant decrease in emissions. These examples demonstrate that limiting car usage can significantly improve air quality, which is essential for public health.  Secondly, reducing emissions can help combat climate change. The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and cars are a significant portion of that. By promoting alternative transportation options, such as public transportation, cycling, and walking, we can reduce emissions and decrease our reliance on fossil fuels. For instance, the passage states that the smog in Bogota, Colombia, is reduced when cars are banned, and the city has seen a significant increase in biking and public transportation usage. This shift towards cleaner modes of transportation can help mitigate the effects of climate change.  Thirdly, alternative transportation options can lead to a more sustainable environment. Car-sharing programs and bike-sharing services can reduce the number of cars on the road, decrease traffic congestion, and promote a more efficient use of resources. For example, the passage mentions that New York City's new bike-sharing program and skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect a		1
I agree that they should do the activity Because it can show the teachers of what you know about if you participate. So they dont't repeat it more then once. Like let's say there was a game that a teacher put at the smart board and you need to participate to play. That can also help you review of what you don't understand. To pass your SOL is to review everything we discuss about. When you participate it's also showing the teachers that you already know everything and what you know about and it's also showing that you been following the directions and paying attention in class. It helps students learn fast in other ways. Students can learn fast sometimes when you participate. I once participate like every time in math but once I kept doing it until I understand everything and then I get better and better that no student don't have to complain about it any problem that we don't understand about it. I understand people do not like it but it is what it is. Like my brother never participate but he is no matter what they would say to him that he needs to participate for his grades.  I disagree I guess because people don't like to participate like they can be nervous sometimes and they just don't feel like it. Like sometimes people be shy and are scared. Because when the teacher calls out there name they have to stand up and participate and there scared because they dont know the answer and there like standing up there knowing nothing which makes them feel like there going to say "i don't know". Some students want to participate because they know what to answer the question. some do not because they be shy, nervous, and scared. But I was thinking why not participate when we want to. Because people be uncomfterabe like students sometimes be lazy that they do not wanna participate on anything they want or have too and they sometime be stressed about it I sometimes see them having an attitude but I don't know what's up with them but my countselor told me to focus and I alsways be tryig to focus and my old best friend said it was stupid for just trying to get your grades up but not focused on my friends but to be honest grades are much more important and that is why I always go traight to class.  Like we need to participate there is no other choice because that help us learn but I agree because students need too get use to talking in front of everyone. Like I know where shy, nervous, scared, and uncomfterable but I Know we'll get use to that. Because high school is different and I know we'll do that in school so obviously I'm a get use too it. Like writing a speech I know that could be nervous becuase you need to make one and it could be long. but reading in front of everyone is fine everyone does it. I once was scared until I know everyone I didn't feel nervous or anything. I know people don't like to paticipate because there lazy or maybe because there tired and nervous I get now why people don't wanna participate on anything else now.  I guess once you know everyone and friends with them your not like nervous anymore or anything like your comfterable with them because you know them I mean that happen to me. I'm just friends with all my classmates and not even afraid to stand up and say something I'm guessing get use to what your afraid of then you don't have to worry no more and just speak up and finally participate. Of what you know and of what the teacher show you to pass your SOL. Students go to school to learn to learn of what you do not know but want to know once you grow up. When my mom was a thirteen she didn't went to school and now I go to school and I wanna tell her everything so she knows too. When my dad was thirteen he didn't went to school either because my gandma did not have enough money to pay for my parents but now I go to school and I wanna learn something that could happen here on this earth like I wanna know more about this earth something intresting. Like the coronavirus that's in va right now I wanna know more about it to help my family get through it.  I agree with this that people should participate on anything rather there scared or not I agree. Because students should learn once they participate like the game on the smart board. Once I participated on math class and answer my teachers questions that I kept messing up because I didn't know but I wasn't nervous I asked a question or kept trying to get the answer even though I try to guess to get an answer. My parents really want me to have a A in all my classes. I see some students that doesn't wanna work in any classes and they don't want to participate because they don't know and because they don't wanna learn anything like my best friend she does not want me too teach her of what I know. Like all she does is talking with boys and boys but what's important right now is the grades so i can get my dream job and have a nice life with my family and friends and most importantly is not going back to a grade that your in right now and like I been participating since I was a kid in elementary school. I'm here to learn and help my family after the coronavirus my mom is scared so am I because I'm afraid that I'm a die they say coronavirus can kill you and now I wanna learn more about it like maybe read more books about it and find some more definitions about it to let my family and friends know what does it do and what causes it. I agree that they should do the activity to get a good grade and if not participate then you won't be able to pass and move on to learn something new grades are important so I say yes to do the activity even if it's hard we'll keep trying it to finish and to pass and get a A in every class like science we have to do a project then we need to do it in order to know and have a A in that class and the rest the same thing like almost all the classes are like the same which we might do a lot in high school.		0
Many scientist believe that studing venus can be dangerous but it is worthy to learn about it. The author has very good point that we should find out more about Venus. They say that Venus has been covered in oceans in the past. It may have provied life like earth did."Often refered as Earth "twin ", Venus is the clsoest planet to Earth term of density and size , occasionally the closest distance too." states the author. This means their might have been life before in Venus.  Even though it is dangerous to explore I feel that we should beacuse it is important to learn about our planets. Venus reaches the average 800 degrees Fahrenheit. "The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experienece on our own planet." Those are hard chellenges that scientists have to phase when exploring the planet. It is so intresting to learn about our planets. We can compare them. "Venus has the hotest surface tempertrue of any planet" staes the author.  Today Venus still has some of the same feature that are the same. Like our planet, Venus has valleys, moutains and craters . The planet also have strong earthquakes, and tunderstorms. Thsi makes it extra hard for scientists but its makes it hard. In text it states that  "Solar power would be plentifuol and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions but survivable for humans.  In coclusion, it is challenging but anything is possiable. I do agree with them."Our travels on Earth beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expand ed to meet the very edges of imagination and innovations." We should not have fear of exploring. That is what the author is saying. We should all agree with this. Life may be hard but we should explore.		0
Policy one: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off. I acknowledge that some students are irresponsible. Some students choose to put their education before other things.  Other may not want to consult to their teachers about using their phones at certain periods of time. I am a student who would consult with their teacher to use my phone at a certain time or free time. Some may say that students don't care, but that's not how all students feel. The majority of students in present time choose to use their phone anytime in school during a class. Another reason students should be able to bring their phones is because some students would need their phone at the end of the day to call a guardian or relative for a ride home. Teachers believe students shouldn't have phones period because of the unnecessary usage of the phones in school.  Education comes before things that are not really that necessary. Only some students should be able use their phones. Some students should be able to bring phones also because they should use it for emergency. If a teacher or adult isn't there to help someone or student then a student can call 9-1-1. I personally believe that students who are able to keep their grades positive should be able to bring and use their phones at school. I also believe that some teachers would feel benevolent. There are some of the reasons cell phones should be brought to school.		0
 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a widely used methodology in the field of psychology for analyzing and interpreting human facial expressions. It was developed in the 1970s by Paul Ekman and Wallace Vaughan, who aimed to identify the universal patterns and movements that underlie human facial expressions.  The FACS is based on the idea that facial expressions are the result of the interaction between the nervous system and the facial muscles, and that by studying these interactions, we can gain insights into the psychological and emotional processes that underlie them. The system consists of a set of standardized codes for analyzing and categorizing facial expressions, based on the position, movement, and intensity of the various facial muscles.  The FACS is widely used in research and clinical settings, as well as in practical applications such as lie detection, human-computer interaction, and medical diagnosis. Some examples of facial expressions that can be analyzed using the FACS include smiles, frowns, surprise, anger, and fear.  One of the strengths of the FACS is its ability to provide a standardized and objective way of analyzing facial expressions. By using a code-based system, researchers and clinicians can compare and contrast expressions across different individuals and contexts, and can identify the underlying psychological or emotional processes that underlie them.  However, the FACS is not without its limitations. For example, the system can be difficult to interpret and apply to new situations, and may not always capture the complex range of emotions and expressions that are common in everyday life. Additionally, the FACS may be influenced by cultural, individual, and situational factors, which can affect the validity and reliability of the coding system.  In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is a valuable tool for analyzing and interpreting human facial expressions. While it has its limitations, it provides a standardized and objective way of studying complex psychological and emotional processes, and has many practical applications in a range of fields. As the FACS continues to evolve and improve, it will likely remain a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and practitioners alike.		1
Introduction: The Face on Mars, located in the Cydonia region of interest, has been a hotly debated topic since its discovery in 1976. While some believe that the Face was created by aliens, I am here to argue that it is simply a natural landform. As a scientist at NASA, I have studied the Face extensively and have come to this conclusion based on evidence provided in the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars."  Body: One claim that supports the Face being a natural landform is that it lacks the symmetrical features that are typical of artificial structures. The article states that "the Face lacks the kinds of symmetries that we would expect to see in something that was constructed." This means that the Face does not have the uniformity and balance that would be present in a structure created by intelligent beings. Instead, it has irregularities and inconsistencies that are more commonly found in natural landforms.  Another claim is that the Face is not a unique feature on Mars. The article explains that the Cydonia region, where the Face is located, is actually "a region of chaotic terrain." This means that the geography of the area is characterized by irregularly shaped hills and valleys, which can create formations that resemble faces or other objects. In fact, the article mentions that "other similar faces have been found in this region." This suggests that the Face on Mars is not a singular, extraordinary feature, but rather one of many formations that can be found in the Cydonia region.  Furthermore, the article discusses how the Face has changed over time. It states that "the Face appears to have undergone significant changes since it was first photographed in 1976." Specifically, the nasal region has been eroded, and there are now small impact craters on the forehead and cheek. This indicates that the Face is not a rigid structure, but rather a dynamic landform that is subject to the same natural processes as the surrounding terrain.  Finally, the article provides evidence that the Face is not an alien structure based on its composition. It explains that the Face is made up of a type of rock called dolomite, which is "a mineral that forms in the presence of water." This suggests that the Face was formed through geological processes, rather than being constructed by intelligent beings.  Conclusion: In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not a creation of aliens, but rather a natural landform that has been shaped by geological processes. The lack of symmetrical features, the presence of similar formations in the region, the changes that have occurred over time, and the composition of the Face all support this conclusion. As a scientist at NASA, I am confident that continuing research and exploration will continue to uncover the secrets of the universe, but in the case of the Face on Mars, it is clear that it is a natural part of the planet's geography.		1
 The passage set highlights the growing trend of limiting car usage in various cities around the world, including Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, and Bogota, Colombia. This trend is part of a larger movement called "smart planning" that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve public health by reducing car usage. The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and increased public transportation usage.  One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is improved air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and reducing their usage can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve public health. For example, in Paris, France, the city enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog, resulting in a significant reduction in air pollution levels. Similarly, in Vauban, Germany, the ban on cars has resulted in a significant reduction in air pollution levels.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is reduced traffic congestion. Cars are a major source of traffic congestion, and reducing their usage can help to reduce congestion levels. For example, in Bogota, Colombia, the city has implemented a car-free day program that has resulted in a significant reduction in traffic congestion levels. Similarly, in Vauban, Germany, the ban on cars has resulted in a significant reduction in traffic congestion levels.  In addition to improved air quality and reduced traffic congestion, limiting car usage can also increase public transportation usage. Public transportation is a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way to travel than driving a car, and reducing car usage can encourage people to use public transportation more often. For example, in Paris, France, the city has implemented a free public transportation system during certain hours, which has encouraged people to use public transportation more often. Similarly, in Vauban, Germany, the ban on cars has resulted in an increase in public transportation usage.  While there are many advantages to limiting car usage, there are also some potential drawbacks. For example, some people may find it difficult to adapt to a car-free lifestyle, and there may be some inconvenience associated with using public transportation. Additionally, some people may find it more expensive to use public transportation than to own a car.  Despite these potential drawbacks, the advantages of limiting car usage are significant, and it is clear that this trend is here to stay. By reducing car usage, we can improve public health, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more sustainable and livable cities. As such, it is important for individuals and governments to take steps to limit car usage and promote more sustainable forms of transportation.		1
I vow against the value of using technology to read student's emotional expressions. My reasoning is big data companies will configure this to their advantage and bordeom in a classroom can guide someone toward something higher.  To begin,"Big Brother" will exploit this in order to make money off of it unsuspectedly. The text gives an example of what the technology can do in terms of personalizing ads. It does not matter who someone is big data companies, will find clever ways of gathering anyones data in exchange making life more simple no matter if that person is student or not. Once the data is stockpiled, it is on the internet and avaliable to anyone that pays for it.  Secondly, bordeom as terrible as it sounds is good for the brain. Bordeom in the text is mentioned as something that looms in the learning environment and this new technology can help create a more effective lesson. The second society lets such algorithms coexist with AI that is when the people lose control of their lives; because, it will let robotic minds make decisions for society. Boredom is misunderstood, it can allow society to have think beyond the surface and allows someone to excel as they then understand the joy of a subject has detierated, now looking anew.  To conclude, "Big Brother" would manipulate this technology to profit and boredom is beneficial. Not everything is what it presents itself as on the surface.		0
The digital age has brought about significant changes in the way we access and consume information. With the rise of e-books, online databases, and other digital resources, the role of traditional libraries has been a topic of debate. While some argue that libraries have become obsolete, I believe they continue to play an essential role in our communities.  To begin with, libraries provide access to a wide range of resources for people from all walks of life. Not everyone can afford to buy books or subscribe to academic journals, but libraries make these resources available for free. They also offer access to computers and the internet, which is crucial for those who do not have these resources at home. For many people, especially those in low-income communities, the library is their only means of accessing information and technology.  Furthermore, libraries serve as community hubs where people can gather, learn, and connect with others. They offer programs and activities for children, teens, and adults, such as book clubs, workshops, and author talks. These events foster a sense of community and encourage lifelong learning. Libraries also provide a safe and quiet space for students to study and do homework, away from distractions at home.  In addition, libraries play a vital role in preserving our cultural heritage. They house historical documents, rare books, and other artifacts that tell the story of our past. By preserving these materials, libraries ensure that future generations can learn from and appreciate our history.  While it is true that many resources are now available online, not all information on the internet is reliable or accurate. Libraries provide access to credible sources and trained professionals who can help people navigate the vast amount of information available. Librarians are skilled at helping patrons find the information they need, whether it be for research or personal interest.  In conclusion, while the digital age has brought about changes in the way we access information, libraries continue to play an essential role in our communities. They provide access to resources, serve as community hubs, preserve our cultural heritage, and offer guidance in navigating the vast amount of information available. Therefore, we must continue to support and invest in our libraries to ensure that they remain a valuable resource for years to come.		1
Making Mona lisa simle in mona lisa picture that evryone see she is always smile she never mad or said or depressed. technology people try to make a new software so the computer can show weither you are mad or sad or happy it will tell you that and some ads will pop up and let either you are happy or sad. The computer will tell us what are emotions are and i kind of like that because the computer is leting me know if i'm mad or not or sad or not and if i am ann ad will pop up tell mad or sad .But some people wouldn't like being told their mad or sad some people are different from other people .Like when i look at the mona lisa picture it makes happy it makes me feel good about myself make me wanna look up to her like row model. moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them. But that is good idea to come up with and see how it works .		0
Taking classes online offers students many advantages as opposed to attending physical classes in school. For students who are not fond of attending class in person, online classes provide the benefit of being able to learn from the comfort of their own homes. Students who take online classes can also work at their own pace, since they are not limited to prescribed class times. Furthermore, classes are available on their own schedule and assignments can even be due after midnight, meaning snow days and other external factors that would otherwise cause school closure have no effect. Taking classes online provides students with a convenient option to work with their own schedule and complete work in a more comfortable environment. Therefore, it is fair to conclude that online classes have clear advantages that benefit students in their learning process.		1
In 2009 Google created "driverless cars". They weren't fully independant but they were the beginning of something great. Driverless cars will save the lives of people who would otherwise die in a car crash. Driverless cars will create jobs for people who need jobs. People are getting lazier and lazier, and they don't want to drive themselves anymore. Driverless cars are the future.  Car crashes are caused when a driver isn't paying attention or they are intoxicated. This could mean the driver was texting, eating, changing the radio station, or even falling asleep at the wheel. With driverless cars people will be able to do whatever they want while the car is driving without worrying about crashing. They could text all they want or even sleep. The driver just needs to be prepared to take over the wheel if the driverless car runs into a roadblock and needs to go on a detour or needs to be parked. Driverless cars will take people who are out with freinds anywhere they want to go. Having friends in the car with you is one of the most distracting things to a driver, with all the talking and laughing. Things can go bad really fast. These cars will also help keep intoxicated drivers off the road. Some driverless cars can independantly complete ninety percent of the tasks required. This will get an intoxicated person very close to their home if not all the way there.  Driverless cars will create jobs. Jobs in programing, design, manufacturing, and upkeep of the cars. Some might say that driverless cars will take more jobs than it gives. These people say that taxi drivers and bus drivers will lose their jobs. Yes, that is most likely true but they will create so many more jobs. The amount of jobs created will be more than the ones lost. As Spock once said "The needs of the many outway the needs of the few, or the one."  People are getting lazier and lazier, they don't want to drive themselves anywhere anymore. This is one of the reasons that we need driverless cars. As society evolves we see that people are getting lazier. Lazy people don't want to drive anywhere. This is where driverless cars come in. Driverless cars will take lazy people who don't pay attention to their destination safely and without accident. People might say that driverless cars end up making people lazier by allowing them to do little to nothing and still get where they want to go. Yes, people might get lazier but it is better than people dying form crashing their car.  Driverless cars will save lives of people who would otherwise die in a car crash. Driverless cars will create jobs for people who need jobs. Driverless cars will also help people who are very lazy. These reasons and many others is why we need driverless cars. Driverless cars are the future.		0
 Venus, the second planet from the sun, is one of the most fascinating planets in our solar system. Despite being often overshadowed by its larger neighbor, Earth, Venus has a lot to offer in terms of scientific discovery and exploration. In recent years, we have made significant strides in understanding this planet and its many secrets, and it is worth exploring what we have learned so far.  One of the most interesting things about Venus is its extreme atmosphere. The planet has the thickest atmosphere of any planet in the solar system, and it is also incredibly dense. Comprised mostly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, the atmosphere is incredibly hostile to life. The surface temperatures on Venus can reach up to 460  C (860  F), making it one of the hottest planets in the solar system.  Despite the harsh conditions on the surface, scientists believe that Venus may have once had liquid water, and potentially life. Evidence for this comes from the discovery of fossilized riverbeds and ocean floor sediments on the planet's surface. This suggests that at some point in the past, Venus may have had a more hospitable environment, with flowing rivers and standing bodies of water.  In addition to its potential for past life, Venus is also home to some of the most extreme climate conditions in the solar system. The planet experiences a phenomenon known as   runaway greenhouse effect,   where trap gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, cause the planet to warm up to an unsustainable level. This has created a planet with incredibly hot and dry surface conditions, which make it challenging for any life to survive.  However, despite the extreme conditions on the planet's surface, scientists are still able to study Venus through the use of space probes and satellites. These tools have allowed us to get a closer look at the planet's atmosphere and surface, and to study how the planet interacts with the sun. For example, the Magellan spacecraft orbited Venus from 2004 to 2008 and was able to document 98% of the planet's surface, providing valuable information about its topography and geological features.  In conclusion, Venus is a fascinating planet that has a lot to teach us about the early stages of planetary development and the conditions that are necessary for life to survive. While the extreme conditions on the planet's surface make it a challenging environment for study, the advancements in space exploration technology have allowed scientists to learn more about this intriguing planet than ever before. With continued study and exploration, we may even be able to determine if Venus ever had life, and what clues we can find to help us better understand the potential for life elsewhere in the solar system.		1
There is a new technology called Facial Action Coding System. This Coding System can identify your emotions. Dr. Paul Eckamn has been classifiying six emotions." Eckamn has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness." "-Then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."  They have started useing this technology in schools now. "A classroom computer could recognize when a studen is becoming confused or bored." "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." After reading this information from the article, I think we should have this type of technology in school. It could really help the kids who do not talk to their teacher at all. But there is also a downfall of useing this type of technology.  Some of the bad things that could happen is the computer misreading the kid wrong. Therefore, giving him wrong information about what ever he is learning about. It is also very expensive. The worst thing that could happen is the teachers who went to school their whole life trying to become a teacher, they are now jobless. What is the point of paying somebody to teach a student when there is now a computer in their school to do it. That is one of the major negative things from this technology.  Some of the good things that could happen is the student actually learning. There are many students who just sit in the back of the class not talking, but when a computer can do it for them they will probably learn a lot more. They don't have to say one word because when the computer feels that you are sad/happy it would change the subject."For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different." It can really tell how the student is feeling and their emotions at that current time.  In the end, we can take a few positives and a few negatives from this. In the long run it would be better but in the short run it wouldn't. Students will be a lot more smarter but a little bit less social. Teachers might be jobless but the students will probably have a better education and will just be smarter in general.         		0
If i had to choose it would be policy 2 because while im in class someone is always on there phone and they are not paying attention and if there are no phones aloud no one would be texting and there is a better chance that they will pay attention because they wont have anything to do but work because i have seen it myself the teachers catch's the student on there phone and they start paying attention just so the student can get the phone back. Also some students would say if they didn't have a phone how would their parents call if there is an emergency that is why it makes it an hard decision that why phones should placed in lockers and if there is an emergency parents should be made sure to immediately call the office asap so that would be my way of there are reasons to support both but ultimately i would pick policy 2.		0
Millions of people use cars in their everyday lives whether its driving to work, school or even the supermarket. With the amount of people on the streets on a daily basis, its not suprising that there is a major traffic issue in Miami. Most people dont realise how big of an issue this truly is because in reality they just need to get to and from work. I'm here to inform you about the beneficial alternatives to driving everywhere you go.  Whether going to work or driving your kids to soccer practice, a way of transportation is a must. Most people choose the "easy" way out and just hop in their brand new luxury cars. But what if I told you there is an easier way, a more efficient way? All around Miami, there are metro rail stations. These stations are clean, safe, and not to mention useful. There are busses, trolly's, and even metro movers that can take you all around the city. the trains, busses, trolly's and metro movers all run on a schedule. An easy way to limit your gas bill, pollusion and time wasted in traffic is to simply set up a route to where you need to go and catch the appropriate mose of transportation.  Time is always on peoples mind, whether you have enough time to go shopping for a¬† new dress or maybe stop by grandmas house. all things require time. Everyday millions of Americans spend hours stuck in traffic due to rush-hour. This means less time spent with family andmore tijme bonding with the annoying car horns constantly beeping. If you could switch to another mode of transportation you could cut time commuting in half. The Metro rail avoides all traffic regardless and if more people start thinking like this then the bus might soon be avoidingall traffic too. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says "When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Everyday she walks verdant streets listening to the delightful sound of people chatting and children playing, something she was unable to appretiate with her windows rolled up as she drove around town.  So many fuel consuming vehicles on the street on a daily basis can't be too great for our enviroment, don't you think? It isnt, all this pollution is causing a nasty smog all over the world, some places more than others. Paris tends to have more smog than Europe but not too long ago, Paris had 147 micrograms or particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels. This smog makes it difficult for dilivery companies to complete their jobs. This smog isnt good for us either just think about what you are breathing.       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†    		0
Is it really important to stay connected to people every minute of every day? Even while driving? Texting and driving is a plague that has ravaged the lives of many people all over. There are way too many people dying because if this outrageous act. People really have to take notice in how dangerous this problem is.  As hard as it is to take your eyes away from your phone, it needs to happen. Sending a simple text is not worth a life. It can be extremely crucial, especially when it comes to texting and driving. Millions of people have died and killed others due to this epidemic. Texting and driving has been the leading cause of car accidents in the recent years.  Texting and Driving is probably the most common in the death of teens. Not only is it dangerous to the person driving, but to all of the cars surrounding the person that is driving the vehicle. In agreement with many people, texting and driving is similar, if not Identical to drunk driving. Using your cellular device impairs your vision and causes you to lose focus on the road. We as a nation should make stricter laws enforcing "No texting and driving" or creating a system that disables your phone the moment you pull out of the driveway.  Even though texting and driving is a well-known known issue our young and older adult are blind to the consequences of it. As a result of texting becoming so popular, the percentage rate of the deaths due to these types of accidents have rapidly increased. Texting and Driving puts so many unknowing people at risk. People think that being connected to other is more important than focusing on the road ahead. While being behind the wheel of a moving vehicle, drivers should never direct their attention to their cellphones or any other mobile device.  Texting can be extremely hazardous when you are behind the wheel of a moving vehicle. Texting and driving is most frequent in young adults. The dangers of texting and driving results in the increase of deaths annually, because texting is so popular. If people would open their eyes to the dangers of texting while driving, less car accidents would take place every year and the roads would be much safer.          		0
Often times, students are more apt to finishing the project when they get to choose their own project. Many believe that working hard will continue your strength of knowledge. That being said, I believe that if students had to complete an assignment over summer break, it should be student-designed. This would give them the opportunity to show their creativity, knowledge, and work ethic.  Students who are able to choose their own assignment would be able to express their creativity how they believe it would fit. A portion of students could be excellent drawers, or just find enjoyment in drawing, and find that they want to do a project that they could express their drawing abilities. Others may find that they are more crafty and choose to do a sculpture of a significant scene in a book that they read. Students who are able to choose their own project can make it seem more interesting to them, given that they could make it how they want. Some may believe that having a teacher-designed project would be better, but not everyone would get to show their creative abilities. Creativity is an important factor that goes into making a project great.  Second, students that get to pick their own project, would be able to show their strength of knowledge that they have learned throughout the years. This would be able to help them create something extraordinary and impress themselves and their teachers. Being able to express your knowledge can show someone how far you have come in your education and what you are still weak in. Finding your weaknesses is an important aspect and can help you grow as a person both inside and outside of school. Students that get to pick their own projects would be able to make it challenging for themselves. People may think that having a teacher-designed project would be more fair to everyone, but I believe that everyone's¬†knowledge is different, so allowing them to design their projects would accompany their knowledge best. Thus, being able to express their knowledge is another important component in allowing students to pick their own project.  Last, having students choose their own projects would help show their work ethic. By allowing them to choose their projects, it can aid them in allowing them to choose an assignment that they could finish in a couple of days, or challenge themselves and make a thorough project. Students, that I have seen, that get to pick their own projects are usually more ecstatic about making them above their expectations and have fun with it. This can also help them in managing their time wisely by being able to both finish the project and have fun during summer break. Some think that students should be given teacher-designed projects over the break so they will be more encouraged to finish them. I believe that if students are given a choice in what they want to do for their project, that it gives them more motivation to work on it and continue to make it better. Showing work ethic in an assignment is also an important aspect to allowing them to choose their own projects.  Overall, I believe that allowing students to make their own project shows their creativity, knowledge, and work ethic. Not only do they get to make it all of the above things, but they also get to have fun with it. Sometimes not everyone enjoys the assigned projects that they are given by their teacher, so this allows them to get to expand the horizon and make it their own. Therefore, I believe that if students are given a project over summer break, it should be student-designed.¬†		0

 Aesop's famous saying, "No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted," highlights the importance of small gestures of kindness. Kindness can take many forms, from opening a door to giving compliments to helping someone with their bags. These small acts can have a significant impact on others, even saving lives.  For example, a simple act of kindness such as asking someone how their day is going can make a huge difference in their life. It shows that you care about them and are willing to listen. This can be especially important for someone who is going through a difficult time and may feel isolated or alone. By reaching out and offering a listening ear, you can help them feel supported and valued.  Another way that small acts of kindness can make a difference is by encouraging others to do good things for others. When someone receives help, they may feel grateful and inspired to pay it forward. For example, if you help someone with their bags, they may feel grateful and may later offer to help someone else. This can create a chain reaction of kindness, where one small act can inspire others to do the same.  Ultimately, the importance of small acts of kindness cannot be overstated. They can have a ripple effect that can change the world. By making a small act of kindness today, you can inspire others to do the same and create a brighter future for everyone.		1
 It is possible for younger and older students to work together effectively, as they each bring unique strengths and perspectives to the table. While older students may have more experience and knowledge, younger students may be more adaptable and able to learn quickly.  One way that older students can help younger students is by providing guidance and support with school work. Older students can offer advice on how to approach problems, explain complex concepts, and provide feedback on assignments. This can be especially helpful for younger students who may be struggling to understand the material.  Additionally, working together in a team can benefit both older and younger students. Teamwork is a valuable skill that can help students develop communication, collaboration, and leadership abilities. By working together, older and younger students can learn from each other and share their ideas and perspectives.  It is also important for older and younger students to learn from each other and give each other valuable advice. Older students can provide guidance on important life skills, such as time management and goal setting, while younger students can offer fresh perspectives and ideas. By sharing their knowledge and experiences, older and younger students can learn from each other and grow as individuals.  Overall, schools should consider implementing programs that pair older students with younger students. These programs can provide opportunities for both groups to learn from each other, develop valuable skills, and work together effectively.		1
I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving. It's really dangerous and a lot of people get injured or even killed from accidents caused by distracted driving. I know some people might say that it's important to be able to answer calls or texts while driving, but it's just not worth the risk.  First of all, using a cell phone while driving takes away from the driver's attention on the road. When you're driving, your eyes should be on the road and your hands should be on the wheel. But when you're on your phone, you're not paying attention to what's happening around you. You might not see that car stopping in front of you or that pedestrian crossing the street. It's just too dangerous.  Another thing is that using a cell phone while driving is a big distraction. When you're texting or scrolling through social media, you're not focused on driving. You might be looking at your phone instead of the road, and that's when accidents happen. It's like driving blindfolded.  Also, think about how fast you're going when you're driving. You could be going 60 miles per hour or even faster. That means that if you're distracted by your phone, you could be driving for a long time without even realizing it. You could be missing red lights, stop signs, and other important signs on the road.  Furthermore, a lot of states have laws against using cell phones while driving. They know how dangerous it is, and they don't want people to die or get hurt. If it's illegal, it must be bad.  I know some people might say that they need to be able to use their phone for work or emergencies. But there are ways around that. You could use a hands-free device or have a passenger answer the phone for you. Or you could just pull over to a safe place and then answer the phone. It's not that hard.  In conclusion, using a cell phone while driving is too dangerous and should not be allowed. It's a major distraction and takes away from the driver's attention on the road. It's also illegal in a lot of places, and there are ways to avoid having to use your phone while driving. Drivers should just focus on driving and leave their phones alone.		1
STAY OFF THE PHONES  So hey you might have heard about cellphones and people driving while they are on their cellphones which is really bad cause so many car accidents can happen while driving and while there on their phone it is a safety hazard and so many people have died from being on there phones.  So you shouldn't be able to have your phone on you while driving it should always be on do not disturb because so many car accidents have happened due to being on your phone which leads to 1.6 million crashes every year. just from someone being on there phone and not thinking about the safety of others which is really sad cause you can cause so many things to happen you can hit someone. while they are walking or probably kill someone there have been cases where people have been on there phone and have killed people even kids.  So there are so many ways to prevent a car accident or killing someone just from someone being on there phone a better way to handle this is to always have your phone on do not disturb and maybe you Bluetooth your calls or tell them you can't talk right now cause you are driving and you get back to them as soon as you get Home .and there are my other ways to not be on your phone you can download certain apps that block messages or notification coming through while the cars is driving. or you can simply turn off your phone and keep out of reach from you and others so no car accidents can happen and everyone can be safe and sound and get home safety to their families.  And in other states there have been if you are caught while driving and being on the phone you can simply get a ticket so it is better to just stay off your phone cause you don't want a ticket and putting someone's life at risk cause you weren't thinking about them so just STAY OFF THE PHONESS!!              		0
Dear, Principal  I think Policy 1 should go. Because if she dose allow us to have phone at school that would be cool. Because we can text at school to our moms and dads when we need stuff we don't have walk all the way to the office when we need to call. We can just text them. We wont waste your time at all. We will get a better graders at school. We will turn in all of our work in on time. You will get more students to go to this school. The teachers will get more money for having a lot of student in their classroom . We only need to use the phones during Free time or lunch but our phones need to be turn off during class. If the teachers catch us texting during class you can take it way from us and give back when you want to give it back.  By: STUDENT_NAME		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.  The Electoral College is a system in which each state is given a number of electoral votes equal to the number of seats it has in the House of Representatives plus its two senators. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district.  This system is deeply flawed. In 2000, for example, Al Gore won the popular vote by over 500,000 votes, but lost the election to George W. Bush because he won fewer electoral votes. This has happened five times in American history, and it is a clear sign that the Electoral College is no longer a fair or representative way to elect our President.  There are many reasons why we should abolish the Electoral College. First, it is undemocratic. In a democracy, the person who receives the most votes should win the election. The Electoral College subverts this principle by giving more power to voters in some states than in others.  Second, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on a small number of "battleground" states. This is because these states have a disproportionate number of electoral votes, and a candidate can win the presidency by winning just a few of them. This means that candidates pay little attention to the needs of voters in other states, which are effectively ignored.  Third, the Electoral College is prone to errors and fraud. In 2000, for example, the outcome of the election was decided by a Supreme Court decision that was based on a recount of ballots in Florida. This recount was deeply flawed, and it is clear that the election should have been decided by the popular vote.  For these reasons, I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President by popular vote. This is the only way to ensure that our elections are fair and representative.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  Your Name		1
  Dear [State Senator],  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. While some argue that the system is outdated and unfair, I believe it is still an effective and necessary component of our democratic process.  One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a more representative outcome in presidential elections. As Bradford Plumer notes in his article "The Indefensible Electoral College," the winner-take-all system used in most states means that candidates are incentivized to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, rather than spending time and resources in states where they are likely to win easily. This can lead to a situation where a candidate wins the presidency without receiving the most popular votes. The Electoral College, on the other hand, ensures that a candidate must receive a majority of the votes, rather than just the most votes in a handful of swing states.  Another argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it provides a degree of fairness to voters in smaller states. As Judge Richard A. Posner notes in his article "In Defense of the Electoral College," the winner-take-all system used in most states means that a candidate who receives a slight plurality of votes in a small state can win all of that state's electoral votes, giving them a significant advantage in the overall election. The Electoral College, on the other hand, ensures that a candidate must receive a majority of the votes in a state in order to win its electoral votes. This means that voters in smaller states have a greater say in the election than they would under a popular vote system.  Of course, there are also arguments against the Electoral College. Some argue that it is undemocratic and unf		1
 In my opinion, it is essential for older students to assist younger students. I strongly believe that this idea would be highly beneficial for both parties. As an older student, I would be able to help my younger peers in various ways, and I think they would greatly benefit from my guidance and experience.  One of the primary advantages of this program is that it would enable students to work together more effectively. By collaborating, they would be able to accomplish more work and achieve better results. Additionally, this program would encourage communication among students, which is crucial for building a strong and supportive classroom community.  Furthermore, I believe that older students are more responsible and trustworthy than younger ones. They have already gone through the same educational system and have a better understanding of how to navigate it. Therefore, they would be able to provide valuable insights and advice to their younger peers.  In addition to the benefits for the younger students, this program would also be beneficial for the older students. By helping their younger peers, they would be able to develop leadership skills and gain a sense of fulfillment from giving back to their community.  Overall, I believe that this program would be highly successful and beneficial for all students involved. It would provide a valuable learning experience for both the older and younger students and help to build a strong and supportive classroom community.		1
Do you ever see the clubs or sport teams walking around the school promoting school events? Do you ever wonder what its like? Sometimes you see the student council walking around the making sure everything is up to date. Or you may see a sport team getting ready for a game. However, it may not be so bad having extracurricular activity, who knows it may be useful, it could help with social skills, find something your passionate about, or with your grades.  Sometimes all you need in life are good social skills. Join a club and try making new friends, you could even try joining a group project. You can also step it up and be a leader of a school project. Or you can try starting your own club. Just listen to the key word and "TRY" something new.  However, if you do consider joining a club, make sure its a club you like. And its okay if it takes you a while to find something your truly passionate about. Its like a baby learning how to walk, it takes them a couple of times, they'll fall, but they shake it off and eventually they'll get their. Also when looking for a club its always good to try art or music, where can express yourself in anyway possible. And its okay if you don't find what your looking for.  And even if you don't want to join an extracurricular activity, at least¬†think about your grades and how it can boost them up. Cause there's a club for everything. For example, if your failing science join a science club so it can at least¬†help understand whats going on. Or a sports team to help boost your physical education grade. Its up to the student and how they feel about their grades.  And therefore, if all students must have an extracurricular activity whether they should or not. It can help with so much, like social skills, for making new friends. Finding something your passionate about, like art or music. Or to boost your grades if your failing any classes. All students should have an extracurricular activity.		0
Studying Venus Remains a Worthy Scientific Pursuit  While exploring Venus presents remarkable challenges due to its inhospitable climate, the author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" makes a persuasive case that continuing such efforts holds great value. Through clear detailing of both the hazards Venus poses as well as the potential scientific rewards, the piece effectively supports the claim that studying this planet is indeed worthwhile despite the dangers involved.   Several key points bolster this assertion. First, Venus resembles Earth in size and composition yet developed under vastly different conditions, offering a window into alternative planetary evolution. Its surface and atmosphere remain virtually unobserved, meaning new discoveries could transform our understanding. Moreover, Venus's proximity allows for comparatively low-cost missions with potential for frequent launches. These scientific benefits far outweigh the risks when weighed against other fields with lower hazards but lesser capability to revolutionize theories.  The article reinforces its position through informative specificity. Graphs and data convey the planet's extreme temperatures and pressure, establishing the challenges yet leaving room for carefully engineered probes. Descriptions of past failed attempts simultaneously acknowledge dangers while implying lessons learned could enable future successes. Throughout, a balanced tone presents obstacles and opportunities in equal measure, allowing the reader to fairly assess whether rewards justify risks rather than dismiss dangers outright.   In summary, the author builds a persuasive case by illuminating both the scientific value and practical feasibility of Venus exploration, while earnestly addressing the real technical barriers. With a deft combination of factual details, comparative analysis, and an evenhanded evaluation of costs and benefits, this piece convincingly argues that studying our nearest planetary neighbor remains a worthy pursuit for science, even in the face of its formidable challenges. The author's support of this claim is thus well-evidenced and logically sound.		1
Dear state senator,  I strongly believe that we should get rid of the Electoral College, not only is it unfair to voters, but it lacks democratic pedigree.  Firstly, my honest opinion is that I stongly believe that we should get rid of the Electoral Colledge. It's very unfair to voters, and most of the time their votes hardly count. When voters vote, they don't really vote for the president, but for a slate of electors who elect the president. Awhile back in 1960, states sent two slates of electors to Congress, instead of one. Now is that really fair? Maybe it was a mistake, but I hardly doubt it. What if it happens again, it's very hard to trust these people. The electoral college is unfair to voters also because of the "winner-take-all" system in each state. What's wrong with this you may ask, well see candidates are very smart, and know what they are doing. They don't spend time in states they know have no chance at winning. 2000 was the worst, during the campaign, seventeen states didn't even see the candidates at all. Rhode Island, South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad.  Secondly, the Electoral Colledge lacks democratic pedigree. Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California, really don't pay attention to the campaign because they know their vote will have no effect. If the president were picked by popular vote, not only would it be more fair and official, but people would take more intrest in voting. But, no voter's vote swings a national election. In 2012 about one-half of the American population did vote, but the difference is, is that they want to express a political preference, rather than others who think that a single vote may decide an election. In 2000, there was a dispute over the outcome of an Electorical College, it could happen again. The Electoral College method is not at all democratic in a modern sense. When you vote for a presidential candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors. See, it's not the people who elect the president, it's the electors who do. So how is that fair, basically your votes don't count toward anything and you're waisitng your time. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on abolishing the electoral college, so why hasn't it happened yet?  I stongly believe that that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It's very unfair to the voters, and it lacks democratic pedigree. The electoral college can cause many disputes, and arguments. Why not just get rid of them? I hope you read this, and understand where I'm coming from.¬†       ¬†    		0
Do you believe aliens are on mars? I am a scientist from NASA and I am here to tell you that there are no alien life forms on mars. Recently we have discovered a landform on mars that has the appearance of a human face. Many believe the face is ancient alien artifacts, and some believe it is a landform known as a Mesa or a Butte. This article will explain why this "Face" is not an alien artifact.  About 25 years ago a spacecraft oribting mars called the viking 1 was searching for landing spots for its sister ship called the viking 2. In 1976 Viking 1 took a picture of something that had the appearnace of a face, NASA could not explain it at first. After some research that mission controllers came to the conclusion that is was another martian mesa, they were common in the region of Cydonia on planet mars. A few days later NASA decided to unveil the image for all to see. The face on mars became a huge hit in pop culture it was featured in movies, books, magazines, and even on radio talk shows. Many people begain to think the face was evidence of aliens on mars and were confused because NASA would want to hid ethe evidence of aliens on mars. "Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars." Although few scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, Photographing Cydonia became a tp priority. NASA took pictures of the face every chance they had. In 1988 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and took good pictures of the face. When the photo was seen it was proof of no alien life it was just a landform on mars. Many were not satisfied and wanted more proof so in 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take more detailed pictures. When the scientist got the picture it shows a martian butte or mesa and the scientist compared it with the Middle Butte in the snake river plain of idaho in the american west. When it comes down to it there is no alien life on the planet of mars and the face is nothing but a landform with the appearance of a face. I hope this article has helped you decide if you think it is alien or a landform. 		0
Hello everything i am PROPER_NAME we will be start talking about how technology should not be used in today's work as right now.  So I will be explaining why first then secondly after that i going to be talking about reaons . Okay I yall enjoy this paragraph i written it from my head put alot of compassion inside of this.  Alright so why should student's should be allowed to have technology.Okay so there is many reasons why i think we should have alittle of technology in our time as right now.But most importantly the resources that we will be able to use for information.To find good article facts about a pacfific topic on a good reseach.Why dose 95 % of the world use technology for because of social media if social media wasn't even alive right now there would be no more usage of the devices that the world have as our time today.But most people don't realize that not having technology now days could have impacted Amercian's too be more worried about there love ones.Althought people could just use not alot of the usage of phones and laptop's and computers etc. This time of age little kids even use more technology than adults do just because of the games have been made on the devices.The reason why people use much technology cause now days there are more outbreaks on social media like how billy Graham died they sent a whole tweet about it the news got big on social media. I can see why half of the reaons why people use technology much as for there work and jobs they have to look up research about stuff ordering different types of things so they can have the right enought things that they wanted to get on a website.But most people don't realize you can just do that and also not use as much technology most kid's don't even interact with one another they always text there friends on a apps like snapchat ,instagram facebook and including messager on apple phones and samsung phone's .They just text there friend's and say you want hang out at my house but they don't realize half of Amercians don't get there home work done in school just because of the technology we have now day's half of school in my class be on there phone 24/7 they don't even pay any attention to most of the teachers that trying to benefit them to have a nice good decent edcuation and including how they listen to music while a teacher trying to get there attention to answer a question that we a learning in class so i think people should not be allowed to have technoloy in school or out of school.  I HOPE YOU  LIKE MY PARAGRPAHS AND READ HOW I THOUGHT OF THIS ON MY OWN .  Thank you for reading everyone bye.                                                                                                                                                                                                      		0
Various schools agree that summer is the optimal period for learning; however, they are indecisive over the issue of designating teacher-designed or student-designed projects as the prominent method for students to prepare for the next school year. Many teachers spend time creating projects for students to ensure students have an adequate grasp for their oncoming course. Additionally, schools mirror the success of other schools by attributing the idea of summer projects into their own curriculum. Students often procrastinate on summer projects because the summer projects do not captivate their attention, and they view the assignment only as a complementary task. While some schools may argue that teacher-designed projects align with the concepts addressed in class, student-designed projects enable students to discover ideas individually and increase retention time for them.  Student-designed projects provoke a stronger understanding of a topic because students spend time garnering information and relating it with current events. For example, incoming A.P. Spanish students need to familiarize themselves with content which relates to the themes covered in the class. They may design a poster for each theme by organizing current events under an example column and summarizing the most pertinent details found from their research. Student-designed projects benefit students because students are inspired to conduct research on the topic, and students are not limited to guidelines. They promote a higher capacity for creativity because students expand beyond the parameters of the subject and force students to actively engage with the project. The flexibility of student-designed projects can cover a topic more comprehensive than teacher-designed projects because they stretch beyond just the bare bones¬†of a topic. Semantic encoding, the act of obtaining memories by relating information directly to the source, increases retention time because the students grapple with the topic, and they encode the information to long-term memory. By storing the information in long-term memory, students can prolong the retention curve, a graph that depicts an increase in memory loss as time increases.  Teacher-designed projects provide a snapshot of the course because they contain significant elements that are modeled after the course's itinerary. At the end of the school year, tenth grade English teachers dish out a list of recommended books to give students a head start on the book review project due shortly after the break. The book review project requires identifying the author's argument and tone which helps students develop the skills required for the analytic essay component of the A.P. Language and Composition exam. Teacher-designed projects expose students to a strict interpretation which allow students to extrapolate the necessary ideas and disregard the trivial details. They are not intensive to complete because their primary function is to spark interest with students and are merely a precursor to the course. Although they may abide by the topics of a course, they fail to prepare students for the challenges of the course. On the contrary, student-designed projects require huge amounts of effort and incorporate additional information that can allow students to gain a deeper understanding than teacher-designed projects. Teacher-designed projects can limit the perspective of students because they follow the same perspective of the teacher who designed it; meanwhile, student-designed projects can allow students to gain a global perspective of the topic and de-emphasize the focus of students on themselves but on other issues occurring throughout the world.  Although schools utilize teacher-designed projects for summer learning because they stay within the confines of the teacher's syllabus, student-designed projects are ideal in fostering intellectual growth for students because students are permitted to seek a plethora of sources which enhances their learning and they strengthen their retention of the subject due to constant exposure with the material. In a foreign language class, students are given the opportunity to design their own projects. As such, they expand on their Spanish comprehension because they rely on their own research to provide prototypes that can be incorporated into the course, and their homework is easier because they can cite current events as examples in their essays. In an English class, students are given a teacher-designed project to experience the superficial¬†concepts of the course. The lack of challenge offered by teacher-designed projects is devastating to a student's mastery of a course and impacts the view that students have on a topic because they may be biased at a certain topic. One effective way to implement student-designed projects is to provide a list of the topics covered in a course and allow students to approach the project by choosing the format that suits them rather than a rigid structure that may put off students from completing the task.¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
Many people agree in abolishing the Electoral College. Electoral Collage caused a dispute in the year 2000. The Electoral College is a irrational system and it should be banned.  Certainly the Electoral College has some benefits. In the passage "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our sidpised method of choosing the President" by Richard A. Posner the author states that the Electoral College "avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of votes cast." With the Electoral College there is no issue of a candidate getting the most votes, so there wont have to be any run-off elections. Run-off elections complicated the election process. Posner asserts that the "winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote." It is because of this that the possibility of an argument over the outcome of an Electoral College is lesser then an argument over the popular vote. Although this is true, the people should have the say on who their president will be. The Electoral College is a broken voting system that causes confusion and dispute. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be used as a way of voting for America's President.  A key issue is that the candidate with the most popular vote does not have the certainty of winning. This is a problem because America can not have the leader she wants and deserves. Bradford Plumer from the article "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" argues that the Electoral College causes " the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency." If the people can not chose who they want as their leader then where is their freedom? Plumer also states that¬† the voters can not always "control whom their electors vote for," We dont get to chose who the electors are voting for. This way the value of the people's opinion is being diminished into nothing. The resonable solution to this problem is to just end the Electoral College imidiatly.  Another factor is that the electors have to much power over the election. Palmer writes "that the electors could always defy the will of the people," The electors are the only people who have decent amount of power to chose a president. The people should have that kind of power. The author asserts that the electors " have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please," The electors are able to just change their mind when wver they like. The popular vote must decide on who should win. The future of america should depend only on the will of the people. The people has to finally stand up and fight for their right to chose their own President.  In final consideration, the Electoral College is unfair to the American people. We should have freedom to chose whom our country's leader should be. The popular vote should stay and the Electoral College should be banned once and for all.       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†    		0
Taking online courses has become increasingly popular among students and professional adults alike. While there are many advantages to taking online courses, there are also some disadvantages that need to be considered. In this essay, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of taking online courses and compare them to a seven-hour education course.  One of the biggest advantages of taking online courses is the flexibility they offer. Unlike traditional classroom-based courses, online courses can be taken from anywhere with an internet connection. This means that students can take courses at their own pace, on their own schedule. For students who have busy lives or work schedules, this flexibility can be a major advantage. Additionally, online courses often offer a wider range of courses than traditional classroom-based courses, which means that students can choose from a variety of subjects and topics.  Another advantage of taking online courses is that they often offer a more interactive and engaging learning experience. Many online courses use multimedia elements such as videos, podcasts, and interactive quizzes to help students learn. This can make the learning experience more engaging and enjoyable, which can lead to better retention of information. Additionally, online courses often offer more opportunities for students to interact with their peers and instructors, which can help them build a sense of community and support.  While there are many advantages to taking online courses, there are also some disadvantages that need to be considered. One of the biggest disadvantages is the lack of face-to-face interaction with instructors and peers. In a traditional classroom-based course, students have the opportunity to interact with their instructors and peers on a regular basis. This can help them build relationships and receive personalized feedback on their work. In an online course, students may have limited opportunities for face-to-face interaction, which can make it more difficult to build these relationships and receive feedback.  Another disadvantage of taking online courses is the potential for distractions. With the flexibility that online courses offer, students may be more likely to procrastinate or get distracted while studying. This can lead to poorer academic performance and a less effective learning experience. Additionally, online courses often require a high level of self-discipline and motivation, which can be challenging for some students.  In comparison to online courses, a seven-hour education course offers a more structured and traditional learning experience. In a seven-hour education		1
The author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it present."vening star is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an anmateur stargazer to spot". this quote is telling us that the eveing star is really bright and its the most beautyfull star of all stars in the sky.  "often referred to as earths twin venus is the closest plant to Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too". this quote is showing us the closest planets to the Earth. venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar sysrem, even though mercury is closer to our sun. The national aeronautice and space administration NASA has one particularry compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. NASA possible solution to the hodtile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. imagine a blimp like vehile hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusain landscape. At 30 plus miles above the surface temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on earth. Solar power would be plentiful and radition would not exceed earth levels not easy condition but survivable. in conclution this story is all about eart and the venus .                                                                         		0
I feel that this system would not be the right way to tell about someones emotions,jsut becuse you have a system that tells you this person is feeling his way doesnt mean they are actually feeling that way. Everyone has their own way of expressing either they way they feel or they way thefeel about something or someone. In the passage of paragraph 4 it says "his new computor software stories similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huangs emotion algorithms are a different sort of ' Da Vinci code"! how can someone tell you how you actually feel about something jsut because it was made by a doctor that thinks he can make something up and tell you how your feeling. i wouldnt have a computor tell me how im feeling today or the next day. everyone has their own way of express how they feel. you shoudnt have someone telling you that oh your feeling this way today or your gonna feel this way the next day because everyone can feel different everyday. i woudnt use this system is it was me so i think this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. i wouldnt recommend anyone to use this system 		0
  As citizens, we have the power to make decisions that positively impact the environment and our communities. One of the most effective ways to do this is by limiting our reliance on cars. In recent years, there have been several studies and initiatives that highlight the advantages of reducing car usage. These advantages include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and promoting a healthier lifestyle.  One of the most significant advantages of reducing car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a major factor in climate change. According to a study by the Union of Concerned Scientists, if Americans were to reduce their driving habits by just 10%, it could prevent up to 150 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. This is equivalent to taking 30 million cars off the road (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2019). By limiting our reliance on cars, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.  Another advantage of reducing car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars emit harmful pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide, which can have serious health consequences. According to the World Health Organization, exposure to these pollutants can lead to respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (World Health Organization, 2020). By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and reduce the health risks associated with car emissions.  In addition to the environmental benefits, reducing car usage can also promote a healthier lifestyle. Walking, cycling, and using public transportation can encourage physical activity, which can help to prevent obesity and other chronic diseases (		1
Dear Principal,  I am writing to you today to discuss a matter of great importance to me and my fellow students. I believe that students who have a B average or higher should be allowed to play sports and participate in activities. I understand that there are rules and regulations in place to ensure that students are maintaining their academic performance, but I believe that there is more to life than just academics.  As an eighth-grade student, I have learned the importance of trying hard and making good decisions. It is not enough to just get good grades, but it is also important to be involved in extracurricular activities. Participating in sports and activities can help students develop important skills such as teamwork, leadership, and communication. It can also help students build self-esteem and confidence.  I understand that some students may struggle to balance academics with sports and activities, but I believe that it is important for them to try. It is not enough to just give up and focus solely on academics. Students should be encouraged to find a balance and make good decisions about how they spend their time.  I also believe that allowing students to participate in sports and activities can help them achieve their goals. Whether it is getting into college or pursuing a career, participation in extracurricular activities can help students stand out and demonstrate their dedication and commitment.  In conclusion, I believe that students who have a B average or higher should be allowed to play sports and participate in activities. It is important for students to try hard and make good decisions, and participation in extracurricular activities can help them develop important skills and achieve their goals. I urge you to consider this matter and make a decision that will benefit all students.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
i disagree because some people dont like to do activities at school and they rather go home because some activities at school are boring and the people like to stay after are the ones with more active system and they like to stay for sports or learn more. people would like to see how fun it could be sometimes because staying after is not that bad you can stay at your favorite club and activity mines will be to pla y for soccer club and they could see how much fun it could some people would stay for other classes and be interested so they can bring there grades up and get goods grades on there report card. and some others will go to like a club or a technology room because they think it interesting the principal maybe wanted students to do something fun and not be bored at home the principal probably wants them to be a fun person for a day and give everybody a chance to join a club or activity and have fun and so they can meet other people and know about them so they wont be always talking to the same people sometimes people need to know other people so they can talk about each other and talk about how much they love the activities but in my opinion i want to disagree in the same time because some people dont like to stay after school because its boring and theres nothing fun to do so they just go home some people are just tired and exhausted¬†and thats why some othere people cant even stay just to help there parents around the house or take care of there brother or sister but sometimes you just get bored and dont even want to stay at the school because they are tired of seeing the classes and the people or just even learning sometimes be like i want to stay but they never stay they just and other says i will stay this time and they dont stay but some people just dont like to see the school everyday they only come to learn and leave home but other people come and stay because they have nothing to do or they just bored in the house. so they just go to the after school activity so they wont be bored so they can just have fun.		0
When cell phones were created, it created a huge impact in everyone's lives people would use it for everything like texting, talking, planning, reminders etc. When we have our phones sometimes we do two things at once, but some people multitask at the wrong time like using their phones while driving. We have to start focusing on how much we can do at one time and think about personal safety and the safety of others each time we don't put our phones down. Using a cell phone while driving is dangerous for the driver themselves for many reasons like a car accident can occur when your eyes are off the road. Having your eyes off the road and on your cellular can be terrible for both parties because one party can either lose their life or one party would have to pay damages and get their license suspended because of the dumb decision they made. When driving sometimes it can be diffcult.   		0
Dear senator,  I think for electing the president of the united states we should use popular vote because, sometimes certain presidents got more popular votes but the electoral college voting gave them president with the least popular votes with the election and they became president.  In the election between Gore and Bush, Gore had more popular votes than Bush but Bush still became president because of the electoral college voting system it needs to be changed. States with smaller electoral college voters don't have as much say in who's gonna become president,most of the states don't have more than 10 electoral college voters for them but, in the bigger states like califorina,texas,and florida have the most electoral college voters so they bascilly control who's gonna become president.  This is why I think the electoral college voting system should be removed because of its bad way of helping the united states in picking a president and sometimes it can help a bad person become president and ruin this country since it's mostly polticans who are the electoral college voters and they could just pick the person they want to be president and that person could be a horrible president.    		0
[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State ZIP Code] [Date]  [Senator's Name] [Senate Building Address] [City, State ZIP Code]  Dear [Senator's Name],  I am writing to express my opinion on the issue of the Electoral College and its relevance in the election of the president of the United States. After studying the arguments for and against the Electoral College, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be kept in our political system.  One of the primary reasons for keeping the Electoral College is that it helps to ensure representation of all states in the election process. Without the Electoral College, presidential candidates would focus their campaigns solely on the most populous areas in order to gain a majority of votes. This would leave smaller states and rural areas without a say in the election, resulting in a disproportionate representation of the country as a whole. The Electoral College ensures that every state receives an equal amount of attention and consideration during the campaign.  Another argument in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it promotes a two-party system, which helps to maintain political stability. Under the popular vote system, there is a greater chance for third-party candidates to gain traction, which could ultimately lead to a divided government and political gridlock. By limiting the number of candidates who have a realistic chance of winning, the Electoral College encourages the formation of two major parties who can work together to achieve common goals.  Furthermore, the Electoral College helps to prevent vote rigging and fraud. With a popular vote system, it would be easier for political parties to manipulate the vote count in densely populated areas. Under the Electoral College, each state's vote count is certified by a bipartisan board, ensuring that the vote is accurate and fair.  In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in the election of the president of the United States. It ensures that all states have equal representation in the election process, promotes political stability, and helps to prevent fraud and vote rigging. I strongly urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College in our political system.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
I think you should use policy 1. allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I thing you should go with this policy because there is no need to take cell phones away. Because almost all people have cell phones and that will mean they cant use it. And I think they should at least be able to use them on there free time as long as they are no bothering anyone and they keep it on vibrate .  But I also belive that no one should use them during class because it will be a bother to every one and they wont be able to get there work done because someone would be sitting in class just texting on there phone. But if some don't bring phones to school at all then they wont be able to call there parents to pick them up or in case of a emergency. but the students should not be walking around the school talking on there phones just walking into people because there no paying any attention to what they are doing at all. and they should have there phones off during class to like I already said so no one is on there on there phone in the middle of class bothering people.  Using policy two is just going way to far because the only way that I would do that one is if all of the kids in the school get on there phones in the middle of class and just stay on it for the whole time without doing anything else without even paying attention to anyone or anything else. But policy one is more understanding because it is getting phones out of the way while they are working but not while they are on there free time because phones shouldn't bother anyone if its on there free spare time . But that is my reasen why i would go with policy one.		0
 The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock once said, "Your character will be what yourself choose to make it." In my opinion, this statement holds true because individuals have the power to shape their own destinies.  Indeed, not everyone has the same intentions as the people they surround themselves with. For example, just because I have a friend who wants to become a doctor, it does not mean that I would want to follow the same path. People have their own dreams and aspirations, and it is up to them to pursue them.  Furthermore, people are raised differently, and this can greatly influence their choices and decisions. While siblings may share similar upbringings, they can still have different opinions and habits. Therefore, it is important to remember that individuals have the power to shape their own lives, regardless of their background.  In addition, it is important to recognize that individuals are not solely influenced by the people around them. While it is important to surround oneself with positive influences, ultimately, it is up to the individual to make their own choices and shape their own destiny.  In conclusion, John Lubbock's statement, "Your character will be what yourself choose to make it," holds true because individuals have the power to shape their own lives. While it is important to surround oneself with positive influences, ultimately, it is up to the individual to make their own choices and pursue their own dreams.		1
I think we should keep the electoral college because it at least gives people a say on weather or not the person they vote for gets elected or not, people always say that you can't complain if you don't vote, so I'm sure people wouldn't want to not be able to vote. I'll explain in more detail my reasonings in the next couple of paragraphs.  The first reason for keeping electoral colleges is because people want a say on who's president. America was made to give people freedom, so people being able to pick the pesident is a big part of our freedom, and taking that away leaves us with not as much say in big desions such as a presidental election. The people that would probably complain the most is older people because they are use to being able to vote, and taking that away would get them angry I'm sure, and the people complain louder than they do praise.  Another reason why they shouldn't take away electoral colleges is because of the amount of complant they would get from everyone if they do decide to take electoral college away. It might even make some people turn against their country, but that only goes for the people who are really into politics and voting and things of that nature. People say you can't complain if you don't vote, but if they take that perivlage away, I'm sure you'll be hearing even more complaining than if people have the right to vote, but even so, this up and coming generation isn't really into voting anyways, but it should be avalable regardless.  Those are basically the two big reasons why voting should be avalable to everyone, and not just left up to sentators and stuff. People want a say on who's running their country and because there will be tons of complaining if voting is taken away from them. So, think before you make a drastic desison like that.    		0
"Making Mona Lisa Smile," with the facial action coding system, is a way of a computer being able to read a humans emotions, isnt it kind of weird? technology is progressing more and more everyday, but this isnt something we need, why do we need to read peoples emotions? is it important?  This program allows other people to invade the privacy of others, i would want someone or something reading my emotions just because, even if who ever is trying to "read" your emotions asked for permission its still called personal space, this program to me is kind of useless, maybe there are some ways it could be useful?  In some cases it can be used for people in the hospital, you know when you go get checked up the doctor normally asks you how you feel, and sometimes you dont know how you feel but the doctor needs to know in order to treat you.  But in some other cases, it should not be used in schools or in working areas, dont you think that the students will kind of be scared of that? theres no use for it, maybe some people will make use out of it but some people dont want you "reading" their emotions at all, and you have to respect that. 		0
When it comes to electives, the debate is divided between those who see them as a vital part of academic and personal growth, and those who view them as a mere distraction from the pursuit of knowledge. On one hand, electives expose students to a variety of subjects, allowing them to gain valuable skills and knowledge outside of their chosen major. Additionally, students can use electives to explore their interests, helping them to determine their future career path. On the other hand, some students find the range of elective offerings to be too limited or uninteresting, leading them to question why they even need to attend school at all.   To evaluate the impact of elective classes, one must consider the academic and career opportunities available to students. For example, research has shown that taking an elective course in business can lead to better outcomes for students in finance-related careers. Additionally, taking an elective can help students to improve their academic performance by increasing their engagement with the material. Ultimately, it is incumbent upon educators to offer elective classes that are interesting and relevant to students, in order to ensure that every student has the opportunity to explore the subjects that interest them the most.		1
In my opinion i think that we students should have the right to have our phones out during our lunch period and turn them off when its time to go to class. Since lunch period is the only free period of the day then i feel that we should be able to take our phones out. In my school we have assigned tables which means we cant sit with whoever we want. So, I feel that we should be able to text our friends that are in other tables so we don't have to get in trouble if we want to talk with them.  There is more to do then just text at lunch time with your phone. You can play games, listen to music, watch videos, record videos and more. If we could have our phones out at lunch, it would also reduce the amount of noise there is. Sometimes people would yell across the lunch room in order to talk with someone on the other side. If we could have our phones out, there wouldn't be as much of that as there is now. I don't see the reasons why we cant have our phones out in the cafeteria. Its not like we're going to be able to text somebody in another class because they would have their phones off. Most student would be texting while in class instead of paying attention. This is a reason why some students sometimes just don't learn. If we were able to text at lunch and have our phones off while in your other classes, kids would pay more attention and learn more. Being able to have our phones out at lunch would make things easier for the teachers in the lunch rooms and students. The teachers wouldn't have a hard time looking for any students who have moved from their assigned table, and the kids would be more silent and occupied.  I think that if the principal changes the schools phone policy to this, it would make things easier and better.		0
I dont think the a computer reading emotins would be valuable in a classroom because technology is not always acurrate. We use a lot of different facial muscles when just making one facial expression. Student dont really show emotion when the class their in is boring.  One reason i dont think its valuable because emotions can change at any moment .Saying someone is 80% happy in a pictuer wouldnt always be ture becuase they could be smiling but also could be more sad than they are happy. Some people have a bipolar disoder which makes their eomtion change very fast , and some people are just very temperamental. Some students show emotions differnt than others . For example one student that is very upset could be yelling and shouting about it and another student that as angery as the other student could be very calm about it and not showing that they are angery.  Another reason i dont think its acurrate is because sometimes we dont just use one muscle to make a facial expresion. The computer only test one facial muscle to an emotion. Paragraph three states" For example , your frontails pars laterlis muscle raises your eyebrows when your surprised ..." but also when someone is surprised they sometimes move their mouth muscles. We move our mouth muscles for almost every emotion.  I dont think it would be a good idea to put one of these computers in a classroom becuase each student shows emotion different and some students might not shoe emotion at all , therefore the computer would be getting emotion from about half the claaroom which wouldnt be acurrate .		0
Would it be a good idea to use technology such as computers to read students emothinal expressions. Some people would argue that it is not a good idea beacuse what if some students dont want the computer to tell waht ther felling, they would think it was a little weird. I think that it would be a good idea here is why.  I think it would be a good I dead for computers to read students emotional expressions. I think this because say if somebody is falling be hind in class and the computer can tell. The computer could change the chapter or less he or she is confused with so they could understand it better. The student would no longer be confused and could catch up.  Some people would say that what if the computer thinks the kid doesn't under stand the material that he or she is learning. The computer would change the lesson up a little bit so they could understand it better, but in the long run doesn't. In that case the computer would make it harder for that paiticular student to learn the material given to them.  Some stundents would like it because it would help them ina way that makes them understand the lesson or chapter better witch also would help there grade. If I had the chance to use this technology I would.  Sometimes I am a little lost or cunfused and if you dont get that lesson you could fall farther and aferther in the hole. and never catch up. Whith this technology u would nerver fall behind.  With all the infomation we have the technology could ether help out a student or make them fall behind. The information we have concluds that we would still be etter of we the technology. So not so many people are falling behind and getting confused. You would be able to keep up with your class and not get losed. This is what I think about having this technology to read students emotional expressions.              		0
Can Driverless Cars Truly Be Driverless?  Driverless cars throw people off because how could a car be driverless when the driver still has to be paying attention to the road? The driver has to be prepared at all times to be ready to take over the wheel. Drivers can not fully rely on driverless cars because drivers have to pay attention to the road at all times, drivers are trusting a computer with their life, and the dangers of bordem behind the wheel.  Drivers have to pay attention to the road at all times, even if the "driverless" car is driving. The driverless car can not drive through work zones or around accidents, so the driver has to take control. The driver has to stay alert and ready for anything to come their way. The Google car announces when the driver should be ready to take control, but shouldn't a driverless car be able to drive on it's own? Eventhough the car can drive itself, the driver is still in position like they're going to drive too.  Drivers are trusting a computer based opperator with their life. What if the car was to get in an accident? Whose fault would it be? Drivers can't fully trust a computer to drive their car because they computer could mess up, and could cause an accident. What if a kid were riding a bike, and were to suddenly fall into the street and the driverless car did not read it? That would cause a big uproar for driverless cars. They are not proven to be 100% safe for the world around us.  The dangers of bordem of not driving could be very serious as well. The driver has to pay attention to the road at all times, but they are not driving. This could cause serious bordem, and could lead to falling asleep behind the wheel. At least when driving is occoured the driver has something to do.  Now a driverless car is not a bad idea. The text says that driverless cars use half the fuel that cars use today, and that driverless cars have driven half a million miles without a crash. Driverless cars could be the future, but there would still need to be a lot of work done to the cars to make sure they are completely safe for drivers. Instally cameras in the car would also help with teenagers, and some adults to not be behind the wheel on their phone, which could lead to less accidents. So, driverless cars are a good thing that could come into society.  Driverless cars sound dangerous right now, but as technology advances, they could help in the future. As of right now, driverless cars not be fully relied on because drivers still have to pay attention to the road, computers can crash, and the dangers of falling asleep behind the wheel could be dangerous. Driverless cars are not ready to be on the roads yet.		0
Have you ever wondered whst it'd be like to always have a ride to places? The thought of one person sitting in a car alone and not having to drive to reach their destination sounds pretty luxurios to me. Ther have been, and will always be debates over the existance of driverless cars. Everyone knows that, in a car, safety is always the most important thing. I honestly believe that driverless cars can be made safe if they aren't already, and they should most definately be seen on the road in a few years.  Like I stated earlier, safety is the most signifigant quality in an automobile. as stated in passage number nine, "most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passangers, and pedestrians safe". I'm pretty sure most of the manufacturers making these driverless cars are aware of this also. The googlr cars have been driving themselves since 2009 without an accident. The thing is mainly that the driver should still be alert, and ready to take over in a dangerous situation. Manufacturers are working towards this problem being solved in a few years.  Also, these self driven cars would use less fuel. In passage number one, it states that google founder Sergey Brin forsees driverless cars using half the fuel of today's taxis. This would make the automobile more efficient, and economical. I hear people everyday complaining about not being able to go places, because of the lack of fuel they are able to afford. Well if half today would be full in the future, than what is there to worry about. Go out, have fun, do as you please.  Lastly, but most definately not least, with driverless cars it would be almost impossible to get lost. In driverless cars there would be an internal GPS that knows where it is going. Also, constant updates would notify of any roadwork or detours. The possibility of just typing an address, and just relaxing as you go about your driverless trip certainly sounds satisfying. The endless road trips and vacations would be fantastic.  In my closing, driverless cars in afew years could become safer than human skilled driving. Having to pay less for gas is always a good thing, and never getting lost in places you don't know makes you more confident to go more places. Driverless cars can really change the world with all of the ideas and things that come along with them. The possibilities are endless, and simply fantastic. I almost can't wait to see what can happen in just a few years.                             		0
Would you want summer to be filled to the brim with boring assigments made by your teacher instead of enjoying some of your only time off school? If teachers were to construct summer projects they wouldn't be fun at all. Summer vacation is something to get excited for, not to dread. The teachers' projects would create anxiety for many but letting the students take the wheel could be interesting. The students could think of projects to not only work their minds while on break, but also to enjoy and appreciate what they've done.  Teachers have a hard time giving work that is both challenging and rewarding. If they make a fun assignment, it must be easy. This is true for the opposite: If the make a challenging assignment it's garenteed to be boring. If they let the students make the summer projects they might find a perfect blend of the two. They would make something that requires skill and also happens to be exciting to do.  The taachers' projects would for a fact bring anxiety and depression for a magority of people becasue summer is a time for them to relax and regroup. Some teachers may not understand this concept or try to pass it off as no big deal. Students know what it's like so they could create projects that don't feel overwelming or unfair. It could be a compremise between the students and the teachers to get done the things they need to.  Over the course of summer, the projects might be forgotten if the teachers were to make them because no one enjoys them. To ensure that the projects don't get lost, students would have to think of ideas that would make the projects a blast to get though. Ideas like travelling the world and recording the experience could be trilling and get the gears turning in the students brains.  In the end, leaving it to the student population of the school to make the projects would keep these projects enjoyable, challenging, and overall painless. This project would be like ripping off a bandage really quick to get it done without pain and have fun the rest of break.¬†		0
The use of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology in the classroom to read students' emotional expressions could provide both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, it may help teachers understand how their students are feeling in real-time and identify those who need additional support. Knowing when students are confused, frustrated or bored could help teachers adapt their lessons or approach accordingly to better meet students' needs and maximize learning. This technology may also help identify underlying social or emotional issues affecting a student's engagement or performance. However, constant monitoring of students' facial expressions via computer software could infringe on their privacy and feel oppressive. It may make some students feel uncomfortable or lead them to suppress their true emotions during class. Additionally, facial expressions do not always accurately convey how someone is feeling‚Äîthere is room for misinterpretation without understanding the full context. Before using this technology in classrooms, more research is needed to address privacy and consent concerns. Overall emotional awareness in teaching is valuable, but reliance on software to monitor students' faces risks negative impacts that could outweigh the benefits. A balance must be found between understanding students and respecting their privacy as individuals.		1

 The Face on Mars: A Curious Astonishment  The face on Mars is a well-known curiosity that has fascinated scientists and laypeople alike for decades. This geological feature has been observed from Earth using telescopes, and it has captured the imaginations of many people. Many theories have been proposed about the origin of the face, but the mystery of the face on Mars remains unsolved.  The face on Mars is a large, dark feature that appears to be a crater in the Martian surface. It is estimated to be about 30 kilometers wide and 6 kilometers deep. It is located in the Sinal meridian, on the western side of the Tharsis plateau, and it has been visible from Earth for over 150 years. The most striking feature of the face is its resemblance to the human face, which has led to speculation and conspiracy theories regarding the possibility of the presence of extraterrestrial life on the planet.  One theory that has been proposed is that the face on Mars was created by meteor impacts. According to this theory, the impacts caused the formation of a huge crater that eventually filled with sediment and rock, creating a vast slope that resembles a human face. Another theory suggests that the face was created by the erosion of rock caused by water flowing on the surface of Mars. Some scientists have even proposed that the face may be the result of a volcanic eruption, as the lava that flowed from the volcano may have solidified into a large, dark crater that resembles a face.  Despite these theories, the face on Mars remains a mystery. Scientists have yet to determine the true origin of the face, and the search for answers continues. Some scientists believe that the mysterious feature will eventually be explained, while others are more skeptical, questioning whether the face will ever be fully understood.  Regardless of the ultimate cause of the face on Mars, it remains a fascinating and intriguing feature of the planet. The discovery of the face on Mars has sparked curiosity and fascination among scientists and laypeople, and it has led to the exploration of other features and secrets of the planet. The face on Mars is a reminder of the vast knowledge that awaits us in the universe, and it serves as a motivation to continue exploring and learning.		1
  Dear State Senator,   I am writing to you today to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. As a student of American History and Politics, I believe that the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic system and should be retained.  One of the primary arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a more accurate reflection of the popular vote. As Bradford Plumer notes in his article "The Indefensible Electoral College," the winner-take-all system used in most states means that a candidate can win the presidency with a minority of the popular vote. For example, in the 2000 election, Al Gore received over 540,000 more votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election due to the Electoral College system. By using a system that allocates electoral votes based on the popular vote in each state, the Electoral College ensures that the President is elected by a broad coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones.  Another argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign in a wide range of states, rather than just focusing on heavily populated areas. As Judge Richard A. Posner notes in his article "In Defense of the Electoral College," the winner-take-all system used in most states means that a candidate can win a state with a small margin of victory, while still receiving a large number of electoral votes. This means that candidates have an incentive to campaign in states that they are less likely to win, in order to increase their chances of winning the presidency. This leads to a more competitive and interesting campaign process, as candidates must appeal to a broad range of voters in order to win		1
looking at Luke's point of view it would be a good thing to be a Seagoing Cowboys.  One reason why you should join the program is that as what is said in the article is, "UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."  Someone who wants to help people and animals would want to sing up.  One details form the article that supports Luke's claimsis as what Luke said, "But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventur for Luke Bomberger.  It opend up the world to him.  "I'm grateful for the opportunity," he says.  "It made me more aware of peoeple of other countries and their needs."  Over all if you are somone who likes and wants to help people and things this is what you need to sing up for.  It can as said in the article, "It opened up the world to him." And it can do the same for you.		0
Have you ever seen a alien before? If you have not seen them before how would you know if aliens are real or not. I will know because im in the NASA and aliens are not real.  Aliens are not real because if they were they wouldn't be living on Mars because there's no life on Mars they most likey would invade Earth as we know it. Whatever you seen on Mars it was just a natural landform. If aliens were real they would have almost the same things we have like two eyes, mouth, and two feet, and two ears. The difference between us would be either brown, or gray.  I think aliens aren't real because the face which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. Also thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.		0
The Electoral College should remaining our countries voting system when deciding whom the president of the United States will be. The Electoral College is a process our founding fathers established as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote made by citizens Source 1, paragraph 1. Citizens elect electors who will then elect the president. This system is affective in many ways and shall not be abolished. These electors are conscious of every decision they make when deciding on our president and are here to look at things we may overlook. They are here to help us make the most affective decision. adderall, this is an enormous decision. It is the decision of whom the president of our country will be.  The Electoral College has 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President Source 1, paragraph 3. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a "Certificate of Ascertainment." This lists the candidates whom ran for president in your state and the names of their respective electors. It is a well organized and thoughtout process. This process helps us make the best decision as a country on whom our future president will be.  In source 2, paragraph 13, it states "Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend much time in states they know they have no chance of winning in." Candidates don't take their time in these states because they don't want their beliefs and ideas shut down. They spend some time in these states. The electors for each state help them vote wisely, therefore the absence of presence by these candidates should not be a big ordeal. People want to abolish the Electoral College due to citizens not being able to vote for the president yet they do not realize what this system has provided for us. It provides organization and avoids many, many problems that would likely take place without the Electoral College.  In source 3, paragraph 20, discusses how voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign due to the fact they have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates. These voters are the most thoughtful and should be the ones deciding the election. Also, in paragraph 22, also in source 3 it states how there is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. That pressure is reduced by the Electoral College because it produces and reveals a clear winner.  The Electoral College was created many years ago and has brought organization to our voting system. Why should we try to fix something that is not broken? Changing the system would be illogical. Electors are wiser at making these final decisions than we are. Wwe deserve an input, which we can all agree we recieve, but we shouldn't make the final decisions of our country aimlessly. Electors are people who know exactly what to look for in a president and they are more knowledgable on the subject. The Electoral College is the wisest process we can use in electing our presidents.		0
 The school cafeteria is a place where students go to refuel and recharge for the rest of the day. However, the current menu is filled with unhealthy options that contribute to the students' poor health. It is time for the school to make a change and introduce a healthier menu that will benefit the students in many ways.  Firstly, a healthier school lunch menu will encourage students to eat more nutritious food. This will lead to a better diet, which in turn will improve their overall health. Students who eat healthy on a regular basis are less likely to be obese and have a lower risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.  Secondly, a healthier school lunch menu will help students stay energized throughout the day. Eating a balanced meal that includes protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats will keep students feeling full and focused. This will lead to better academic performance and a more productive school day.  Thirdly, a healthier school lunch menu will promote good hygiene and cleanliness. When students see that their school is taking their health seriously, they are more likely to take care of their own hygiene and cleanliness. This will lead to a healthier school environment and a lower risk of illness.  Finally, a healthier school lunch menu will set a positive example for students. When students see that their school is making an effort to promote good health, they are more likely to follow suit. This will lead to a healthier school culture and a more positive attitude towards healthy living.  In conclusion, a healthier school lunch menu is a great idea that will benefit students in many ways. It will encourage students to eat more nutritious food, stay energized throughout the day, promote good hygiene and cleanliness, and set a positive example for students. It is time for the school to make this change and create a healthier school environment for all.		1
Twenty five years ago NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet and taking pictures. It cam across a picture that looked like a human face. Scientis then studied it for a while and said it was not a sign of life on Mars that it was just the way a landform in Mars was shapped. They then send it out to the people. The people start freaking out because they have the idea on thier minds that Mars might actually have life for us to live in.  On April 5, 1998 the MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos. The photos proved that on Mars there was only landforms. Many people were unsatisfied with the new photos. In paragraph 8 it says, "Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze. Mission conrollers looked again. On April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day on Cydonia Malin's team captured an extradinaryphoto using the camera's absolut mazimum resolution. On the picture it indetinfied that Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.  In conclusion the photos the viking's took are not the face of anything. It is an ordinary photo of Mars landforms. Which were not 100% idenfied untill April 8,2001. Which proves that the photos are just landforms of Mars.		0
Many schools require their students to complete summer projects, but are they given the freedom of making their own product? Some students would prefer to have their teacher assign them a certain project because they struggle to find something that interests them. However, most students prefer to come up with their own idea. Summer projects should be student-designed because it helps develop their work ethic, students can not copy off of other projects, and the final product will be more polished.  Allowing students to design their own type of project would make them more interested in it, and help develop their work ethic. Everyone is interested in different subjects, and not everyone thinks the same way. Giving students the freedom of working on a project in which they find interesting will greatly increase their work ethic. It is crucial that students are developing their minds all year round. When students return to school, they feel like it is their first day of school in their lives. Providing students with the option of working on a project which interests them will make them more prepared for the start of the shcool year. The best students have a great work ethic. They are able to do alot of work for a long time. The more interested a student is in their work, the more they will want to do it.  When teachers assign students work, it is very easy for them to copy ideas. Teachers will assign the same work to all their students, and the students will not do thier own work. When students copy off of other people, they are not gaining any skills, nor learning how to be independent. Allowing students to create their own projects will enhance their creativity, and encourage them to think outside the box. The purpose of school is help young kids find what interests them. No one wants to do something that does not interest them. Therefore, students will not do their own work. Students will do their own work if they are interested in the subject, and allowing them to create their own product is how to accomplish this..  Lastly, allowing students to design their own project will provide a better, more polished final product. It is very easy to create a project on something if the individual is familiar with the idea. The more interested someone is in a certain subject, the better the product will be. For example, it is difficult to write an essay on something that is unfamiliar, or not interesting. On the contrary, it is easy for an individual to write an essay on something that interestes them, or they know alot about. This idea can apply to almost anything, especially a school project. It is hard to find the drive to do schoolwork over summer, but it helps if students are allowed to choose their own assignment, and if students want to work on the project, their final product will be better.  Their are many benefits to allowing students to create their own projects. Their product will be better, they will do it themselves, and it helps develop their work ethic. Finding ways to encourage students to complete their summer work can be challenging, but giving them the freedom of doing something they find interesting is the best way to create an incentive. Their are some benifits to teacher-assigned work, but enabling students to think for themselves is more important.   ¬† ¬† ¬†   ¬† ¬† ¬†		0
Limiting car usage would have many advantages to the community around it. But the main two advantages to limiting cars is the reduction of polution,and also the reduction of congestion in many suburbs. Many cities including Bogota,Paris,and cities surrounding those have already started to limit the usage of cars.  One big problem many scientist are beginning to find out about our world is that our ozone layer is being destroyed by polution we put in the air. A big contributor to polution is the exhaust being produced by the million of cars used everyday. Another big problem country all over the world have to worry about is smog,or a thick layer of fog that is really hard to see through. having this very dangerous factor in the road many car crash ratings have sky rocketed. One way this can be stop is to do what these few country have been doing, that is to have days through out the year where people cant use their cars at all. To help in force this day police have been giving people fines roughly around thirty dollars. In Bogota,Colombia it was the third straight year cars have been banned. after all these years of banning cars the turnout was large. despite gray clouds that poured rain all over Bogota. When the smog went away from Bogota many other cities from Colombia have joined the event of banning cars. a quote from CarFree Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota says that " Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven,pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up". To have these results to such a simple idea is incredible.  Another big problem in pretty much all country is congestion of their inner streets. When streets have major traffic alot of things change including the mood of people,and there is a higher percentage of car crashes. To fix this problem many cities did pretty much the same as before to retrict cars on certain days. A brilliant idea was presented and used in Paris. The idea was that "on Mondays motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31, The same would apply to oddnumbered plates that following day". After this brilliant event finished congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, and after five days the smog was gone.  In conclusion the advantages of limiting cars had a far greater output than input and has also solved many big problems. All we canhope for is the parcipitation of more and more countys or cities to help lives and our world.		0
My position on driverless cars is that I am against it. Autonomous cars still need the driver to be focused on the road. The driver must always be ready to take control of the car in any situation. I feel like autonomous cars give a false sense of safety when it comes to driving one of these autonomous cars. The cars arent fully autonomous they still require the driver to have his hands on the wheel in case he has to overtake the controls.  One reason I am against it is because no road that we drive on is fully predictable, so the cars wont know what to do when some situations arise. Most people who buy autonomous cars think they dont have to focus on the road and just leave it all to the car. Thats false, thats what makes these cars dangerous in a sense. " The can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill," this is the reason I am against it. There may be a time that the driver needs to take over and steer the car out of danger, but since the driver had a false sense of security, he/she wont have time to react. They wouldnt have time to react because they might've been doing something else in the driver seat thinking that the car will steer itself. This is why drivers should always be in full control of the car at all times, because no road is predictable and it requires fast human skills if any situation arises.  There might be safety precautions that can try to prevent you from falling asleep at the wheel. This wont help at all in my opinion. Since the driver isnt doing anything, they will feel tired and bored and close their eyes and sleep. If they're really tired they wont hear the warning signs about work zones or any other warning in that matter. Everyone is different, some people are light sleepers and others are heavy. "GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object." This will fail in some occasions. Say you're a heavy sleeper, and you dont feel the vibrations, and you crash into an object. Will that be your fault or the manufactorers fault for giving you a false sense of safety? Does the vibration have a setting to make it vibrate violently to wake the driver up? Does the vibration start happening at different distances depending on the speed of the car? Also how does one know the reaction time of a driver? These are the test they need to do to know how to make these cars safer. The reaction time of a person woken up from sleep is really slow compared to someone who is fully awake. Also how does the car recognize that a danger is going to happen.  In conclusion this is why I think autonomous cars is not good for the people. Its not safe for the driver who is moving at high speeds down the highway with a false sense of safety. Its not safe for pedestrians who cross streets not knowing if a human is controlling the car or not. Streets will never be predictable and the computers on the car will go off of predictability. Yes there will always be a traffic hazard everywhere you go, and the car might not know what to do and its up to you to get yourself and the car out of harms way. This wont happen if you're asleep at the wheel thinking the car will do it itself and you wont have to do a thing. I feel like if a person is wanting to buy a autonomous car, they will have to take courses on how to correctly use the controls and also what to do when theres an emergency ahead. They will have to know the fundimental things like dont fall asleep on the wheel, always be focused and looking for potentional hazards ahead. Always put your hands on the wheel whenever the car tells you to. Also the main thing they should focus on is to never trust the car to get you from one place to another without your assistance along the way. Thats why in think autonomous cars a negative thing.                    		0
 It is no secret that the face on Mars has captured the imagination of people all around the world. However, there are some who believe that this mysterious feature was created by extraterrestrial beings. While this idea may be intriguing, I believe that the face on Mars is just a natural landform. In this essay, I will present several claims that support my argument that the face is a natural creation.  Firstly, it is important to note that the face on Mars has been observed by humans since the 1970s. When NASA first discovered the face in 1976, they immediately began studying it to understand more about its origin. Over the years, multiple space agencies and scientists have analyzed various images of the face and come to the conclusion that it is a natural landform.  Evidence from the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' confirms that the face on that planet is, in fact, a natural feature. This article explains that researchers have analyzed the features of the face and compared them to other natural landforms on Earth, such as canyons and valleys. They found that the features on the face are similar to the natural landforms found on Earth and suggest that the face on Mars is the result of erosion caused by water and/or wind.  Additionally, the article states that the face on Mars is not static, and it continues to change over time. This is typical of natural landforms, such as rivers and canyons, which can shift and change due to natural processes. The idea that the face on Mars is not static further supports the idea that it is a natural landform.  In conclusion, the face on Mars is a natural landform. The evidence from the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' shows that the features of the face are similar to natural landforms found on Earth and that the face is not static, which is typical of natural landforms. The idea that the face on Mars was created by aliens is not supported by the evidence available. NASA has studied the face on Mars extensively and has determined that it is a natural feature. We should not continue to let our imaginations run wild with theories of extraterrestrial origins when there is no evidence to support those claims.		1
In 1976 pictures where taken of Mars with the Viking 1 spacecraft from NASA. We have dicovered that the pictures look like a face on Mars. We can garentee that "aliens" did not do this. From the data we collected it seems to be that Mars was having formations and the ground/rocks looked like it had shadowed a face.  Over the years as you can tell in the pictures the face begins to form into something different. The "Face" is starting to not look like a face anymore. If there were life on Mars they would try to keep the form from changing, right?  Yes we know what you are thinking, "That cant be Mars doing that," but we have not collected any data of any sign of life on Mars. We have no reason to believe that Mars has any life form of any kind on it. We have seen from other data though that Mars has been changing and the landforms have changed. This is just another formation.  Futhermore we have concluded that the "Face" on Mars is just rock formation. There is no futher information on the "alien" therory and that this is out of the picture.. As you can tell in the picture there is other rocks surrounding it and it is just like the other rocks, they have shadows and the "Face's" shadow is just more life like. The formations of every planet have changed and will continue to change so anything can happen next. 		0
It is in the best interest of the people that you do away with the Electoral College. When people vote, they want it to be a direct vote to the election, not a vote for their chosen candidate's electors. The Electoral College should be abolished because it doesn't guarantee your vote, the House's selection can't be expected to reflect the will of the people, and swing voters could cause a catastrophe.  To begin, the Electoral College should be abolished because it doesn't guarantee your vote. As stated before, when you vote, there is no say in who actually wins the election. You are voting for electors who then vote for the President. While it is a rare occurance, those Electors may betray you and vote for the other party, cancelling your vote totally out. If a candidate gets the most popular votes, that doesn't guarantee them as President, because they still have to get the Electoral College's votes. In the third source titled, "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President" by Richard A. Posner, it reads, "It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888." This sentence means that President Bush won with fewer popular votes and more electoral votes. If their was no Electoral College, Al Gore would've won the election. The people would've thought that Al Gore was going to win, and they were probably in for a surprise when they saw that Bush had won with fewer popular votes. It just goes to show that an election can go either way, and there is no closure for a candidate until it is actually announced who won.  Next, the House's selection can't be expected to reflect the will of the people. Say a Republican candidate gets a majority of the popular votes, but the Democratic candidate wins because he is chosen by the Electoral College. The people of the United States might actually feel betrayed because they felt that the Republican party could benefit the economy and society best, and that President might not be up-to-par and disappoint the people. Also in the third article, it reads "...to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president." The statement really says a lot about both sides of the argument. If there is an Electoral College and if their isn't an Electoral College, people could still feel this way. If a candidate who has less popular votes wins, then those states that voted for him/her might feel as if they "will have no regard for their interests".  Lastly, swing voters could cause a catastrophe. Swing states could be considered manipulative because they all know that the popular vote rests in their hands. Will it be Democratic or Republican? You never know. The candidates focus mainly on campaigning in these states because these are the ones that are half and half, states such as Ohio. While there are thoughtful voters, there are also ones who could care less about who the President is and just want to keep America on the edge of her seat while they decide who they want to vote for. In the second source, "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" is says "In 1976, a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way." The states are swing states and they truly determine the fate of the election. As said before, those states get the most attention from the candidates, who try to make themselves as appealing as possible. In the second source as well, the author says "During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." Rhode Island and South Carolina are states that are almost entirely for one party so there is no use in the opposite party going there to try and persaude them to change their minds because it is most likely not going to happen. While they may feel neglected, it's just how it is.  To conclude, the Electoral College should be banished because it doesn't guarantee your vote, the House's selection cannot be expected to reflect the will of the people, and swing voters could cause a catastrophe.    		0
 Car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular around the world, with many cities implementing policies to reduce or eliminate the number of cars on their roads. While some people find these policies extreme, there are several benefits to having car-free cities. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why car-free cities are beneficial and why they are becoming more popular.  First, car-free cities can significantly reduce air pollution. Cars are a major contributor to air pollution, releasing pollutants such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. In cities where cars are banned, air quality improves as people switch to alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, bikes, or walking. In fact, some of the world's cleanest cities, such as Copenhagen and Oslo, are car-free.  Second, car-free cities allow for more pedestrian-friendly spaces. Without cars, streets become wider and more inviting for people to walk and linger. This can lead to more vibrant, livable communities with a sense of community and belonging. People are more likely to interact with each other and participate in local activities when they feel safe and comfortable walking around their neighborhood.  Third, car-free cities can help to reduce traffic congestion. While many people think that car-free cities would lead to even more congestion, studies have shown that this is not the case. Instead of cars clogging up the roads, people in car-free cities use alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, bikes or walking. This leads to less congestion, faster travel times, and a more efficient transportation system.  Finally, car-free cities can lead to healthier, more active communities. People are more likely to be physically active and exercise regularly when they have the option to walk, bike or use public transit. This can lead to improved physical health, reduced obesity rates, and a overall healthier community.  In conclusion, car-free cities have many benefits compared to traditional cities with cars. They can reduce air pollution, create more pedestrian-friendly spaces, reduce traffic congestion, and lead to healthier, more active communities. As such, it's understandable why more cities are turning to car-free policies. However, it's important to note that these policies are not without challenges, and it's important for cities to carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks before implementing them. Regardless, the trend towards car-free cities is an important step towards a more sustainable, livable, and healthy future.		1
Hey, Mrs. Johnson! üëã  Okay, so for today's essay, we gotta talk about the pros and cons of learnin' from home versus in person. ü§î I think it's pretty important to compare 'em cause, let's be real, not everyone can go to school every day. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ ?  First off, learnin' from home is pretty cool 'cause you can do it in your PJs and eat snacks while you're at it! üçøü•§ Plus, you can learn at your own pace, so if you need more time on a topic, you can take it easy. üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄ ?It's like having your own personalized learning experience! üí™  But, on the other hand, bein' in a traditional school setting is kinda like bein' around other people all the time. üë• You can ask questions, get help from teachers, and hang out with friends during breaks! ü§© It's like a big ol' community! üè° And, you know, sometimes you might learn somethin' new just by watchin' other kids learn! ü§î  Now, I know some parents might like distance learnin' 'cause they can save money on transportation and stuff. üöå But, I think it's important for kids to be around other kids and learn how to interact with 'em. ü§ù You know, like how you gotta learn how to ride a bike and stuff! üõë It's important to learn how to be around other people and how to be a good friend! üë´  So, even though learnin' from home is cool and all, I think it's better to be in a traditional school setting. üè´ It's like, you get the best of both worlds! ü§ì You get to learn at your own pace and still be around other kids and stuff! ü§ù  That's my opinion, anyways! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ ?What do you think, Mrs. Johnson?		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that no longer serves the interests of the American people.  The Electoral College was created in the 18th century as a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by Congress and those who wanted the president to be elected by popular vote. At the time, the United States was a much smaller country, and travel was difficult. It made sense to have a system in which electors would meet in each state and cast their votes for president.  However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary. Today, we have a much more efficient system of communication and transportation. It is no longer difficult for candidates to campaign throughout the country, and it is no longer necessary to have electors cast votes on their behalf.  In fact, the Electoral College is now actively harmful to our democracy. The Electoral College system gives more power to voters in small states than to voters in large states. This is because each state has a minimum of three electoral votes, regardless of its population. This means that a voter in Wyoming has more than three times the voting power of a voter in California.  The Electoral College also allows for the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. When this happens, it undermines public confidence in our democratic system.  For all of these reasons, I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. I urge you to support legislation that would do so.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
 The electoral college is a system used in the United States to elect the president and vice president. The system consists of electoral votes that are cast by members of the Electoral College, which is made up of members of the House of Representatives and the Senate.   One of the main arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it allows for a national election to be held, rather than just a regional or state election. This is because members of the Electoral College are elected by all the states and the District of Columbia, rather than just by the people within a specific state.   However, opponents argue that the electoral college does not truly represent the will of the people. The number of electoral votes each state has is based on its population, which means that states with larger populations have more sway in the election than states with smaller populations. This can lead to a candidate winning the popular vote, but losing the electoral vote, or vice versa.   Another argument in favor of the electoral college is that it helps to prevent the candidate with the most popularity from winning the election. This is because candidates need to win the support of the majority of voters in order to win the popular vote. The electoral college system, on the other hand, requires a candidate to win at least 270 electoral votes in order to win the election, even if they win the popular vote by a large margin.  One potential solution to the problems with the electoral college is to abolish the system altogether and hold a national popular vote. Under this system, the candidate who wins the most votes across all states in the country would be elected as President. This system would allow for a more democratic process, as it would ensure that the candidate with the most widespread support across the country wins the election.   In conclusion, the electoral college is a system used in the United States to elect the president and vice president. While it has its strengths, such as allowing for a national election, it also has its weaknesses, such as not truly representing the will of the people. Ultimately, whether or not the electoral college works depends on individual views and values.		1
Dear State Senator,  I am writting to you today to express my opion on the electoral colledge. I believe that we should keep the electoral colledge the way it is. I know that some people think that it is unfair and that we should have a popular vote system. But I think that the electoral colledge is fair and here's why.  First of all, the electoral colledge makes sure that smaller states have a voice. If we had a popular vote system, then the bigger states with more people would have all the power. The smaller states would be ignored and their intrests would not be represented. But with the electoral colledge, each state has a certain number of electoral votes, no matter how big or small it is. This means that presidential canidates have to pay attention to all states, not just the big ones.  Second, the electoral colledge prevents a tyranny of the majority. This means that if one party or canidate has a majority of the votes, they can't just force their will on the minority. With the electoral colledge, the president has to win a majority of the electoral votes, which means that they have to have support from a broad range of people, not just one group.  Finally, the electoral colledge has been a part of our country's history for over 200 years. It was set up by the founding fathers and has been used in every presidential election since the begining. Changing it now would be a big mistake. It would be unfair to all the people who have used the electoral colledge in the past.  I know that some people say that the electoral colledge is undemocratic, but I don't think that's true. It's actually very democratic because it gives each state an equal say in the election. It's not just about the number of people, it's about the number of states. And each state has an equal number of electoral votes, no matter how big or small it is.  I hope that you will consider my opinion and keep the electoral colledge the way it is. Thank you for your time and consiteration.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
 Venus, the second planet from the sun, is a fascinating celestial body that has captured the curiosity of scientists and people alike for centuries. As the closest planet to Earth, Venus is often referred to as our "sister planet," due to their similarities in size, density, and composition. However, despite these similarities, Venus is a far stranger and more mysterious world than most people realize.  One of the most notable things about Venus is its extreme environment. The planet's atmosphere is incredibly thick and dense, with toxic gases that trap heat and make the surface temperature scorching hot, often reaching up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. This makes it incredibly difficult for any life forms to survive on the surface, and it's likely that Venus has no habitable environment at all.  Despite this, scientists have recently discovered evidence that liquid water may exist beneath the surface of Venus. Water is a key ingredient for life, so the possibility of finding it beneath the planet's thick atmosphere is incredibly exciting. However, even if water does exist, there's no telling if it's capable of supporting life or if it's too contaminated by the toxic chemicals in Venus' atmosphere.  Another fascinating aspect of Venus is the planet's rotational period. While Earth takes about 24 hours to rotate once on its axis, Venus takes over 224.7 Earth days to complete one rotation. This means that Venus spins in the opposite direction of most planets, including Earth, and it's likely that this is due to the planet's intense solar radiation.  In addition to its extreme environment and strange rotational period, Venus also has some of the most incredible volcanic activity in the solar system. The planet has some of the largest and most active volcanoes on its surface, often sending plumes of ash and steam into the thick atmosphere. These volcanic eruptions can last for years, and they play a crucial role in shaping Venus' surface and its climate.  In conclusion, Venus is a fascinating and mysterious planet that offers a glimpse into the limits of what is possible in the universe. With its extreme environment, strange rotational period, and incredible volcanic activity, Venus is a world unlike any other in our solar system. While we may never be able to explore it directly, the continued discovery of new information about this mysterious planet will undoubtedly keep us captivated and intrigued for years to come.		1
Enthusiasm is a powerful force that can drive individuals to achieve great success in their endeavors. It is often said that those who are enthusiastic about a particular goal or task are more likely to succeed than those who lack enthusiasm. While this may be true in some cases, I believe that enthusiasm is not always a guarantee of success.  Firstly, enthusiasm can be a double-edged sword. While it can motivate individuals to work harder and push through obstacles, it can also lead to recklessness and impulsive decisions. For example, someone who is enthusiastic about starting a new business may rush into it without thoroughly researching the market or developing a solid business plan. This can ultimately lead to failure.  Secondly, success is often determined by a variety of factors, including hard work, dedication, and perseverance. While enthusiasm can certainly help individuals stay motivated and focused, it is not the only factor that contributes to success. For instance, a person who is enthusiastic about a particular career path may still fail if they lack the necessary skills or experience to excel in that field.  Lastly, success is often a product of luck and circumstance. Even the most enthusiastic individuals can encounter unexpected obstacles or setbacks that can derail their plans. For example, a person who is enthusiastic about starting a new business may face fierce competition or economic downturns that make it difficult to succeed.  In conclusion, while enthusiasm can certainly be a valuable asset in achieving success, it is not a guarantee. Success is determined by a variety of factors, including hard work, dedication, perseverance, and sometimes even luck and circumstance. Therefore, it is important for individuals to approach their goals with a balanced perspective, taking into account both the potential benefits and risks of enthusiasm.		1
First, I have to say that from Lukes point of veiw he is saying that being a Seagoing Cowboy is good because your giving supplies to countries so they can rebuild their country and you get to travel world, so it's a win win. Luke would want people to join because joining forces with countries to help other countries is something that is helping the less fortunate countries. Some peolpe just think their going over sea to help other people and that's boring,but, when your heading back home you can use the empty space that you put the supplies in for fun activities. I think people should join the UNRRA(the United National Relief and Rehabilitation Assosiation).  Next, Luke would want people to join because you never know what you might learn over sea. You may learn how to do things you never knew how to do like fishing or you might learn about the different countries you go to and you could share that knowledge with your friends when you get home. You could even visit muesems and see things you never knew existed. The things you see could inspire you to make something compared to that and it might be in a muesem one day.  Finally, Joining the UNRRA  is a great oppurtunity because you can do and learn thing you never knew how to do and learn you never knew about the country you might be inat that moment. You could visit muesems and see acieneit artifacts. You could see famous art pecies painted by really famous painters. If people would give the UNRRA a chance you could probably have a very nuce timeand think about inspiring kids to join when they grow up.		0
Drivelss cars should not be developed because they can cause accidents, they can cause the driver not to pay attetnion, and they would cost more.  Drivelss cars aren't really driveless. At certain points they will need the drivers assistance. This can lead to many accidents. In paragraph 9, the text states "most driving laws focus on keeping dirvers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers." The sentence proves that driveless cars may not be completely safe. The driver could depend on the car to drive itself and not be paying attention which can result in accidents. In paragraph 9, it also states that it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. Something would not be illegal if it's comepletely safe.  Another reason driveless cars should not be developed is becasue they can cause the drive not to pay attention. Driveless cars would be like phones. They made driving and texting illegal because it made the drivers not pay attention and caused many death and accidents. The same result can come form drivelss cars. They can be a great distraction becasue the driver would think that the car can drive itlsef and they would not pay attention. From that conclusion, in paragraph 9, the question "If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer" would come up. Who would be responsible? If the driver belived the car can drive itself and the techonology failed, it can lead to death because the driver might not be paying attention. The driver would think the car doesn't need a driver and when the techonology fails and the car spins out of control, many lives could be lost.  Driveless cars would also cost more money in many things. The cost to buy would most likely be more expensive. If drivelessc cars started being in use, there would need to be new signs that fit those specific cars. Driveless cars would aslo need specific shops and equipment. If something goes wrong you would need to get it fixed and the technology used makes it more expensive. Fixing a car is already expensive. You have to buy whatever it is you need to fix and then take it to a shop. If something in the techonology of a driveless car goes wrong and you need to get it fixed, it will denifitely cost more.  Causing accidents, causing the driver not to pay attention, and costing more are reasons why driveless cars should not be developed.		0
Living an active lifestyle is incredibly important for both individuals and societies alike. Physically active individuals have stronger physical and mental health, increased longevity, and exhibit personality traits linked to higher levels of well-being. For societies, physical activity reduces healthcare costs associated with chronic diseases, and increases productivity.   For individuals, an active lifestyle can help to reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases, improve mental health, reduce anxiety and depression, and improve overall quality of life. Studies have shown that physical activity can also help to boost mood, increase self-esteem, and increase energy level. Regular aerobic exercise improves cardiovascular health and lowers blood pressure, and resistance training helps to build strength and muscular endurance.   At the societal level, physical activity reduces healthcare costs associated with chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Exercise also boosts productivity, as it helps to reduce the number of days missed from work due to illness or injury, as well as reduces the cost of employee healthcare. Active individuals also contribute to a healthier and more productive environment, as they are more likely to engage in activities such as volunteering, and have involvement in their community.   It is clear that living an active lifestyle is important for both individuals and society, and that the benefits of engaging in regular physical activity are vast. We should all strive to add more activity into our daily lives in order to reap the countless physical, mental, and social benefits.		1
Just like Luke, you can participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program for free!  What does this program do, you might ask? Well we're here to tell you just what it is, and why you should join it!  We're part of the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitaion Administration," or in shorter terms, the UNRRA.  We have worked together to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. All together we are 44 nations. But helping others isn't the only benefit, you get to see sights you've never seen before.  Everyone has the benefit of seeing atleast one country. Last year, our group had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. They also got to ride the gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. Our group also got to see an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on their way to China.  There isn't only helping people and seeing sites, you actually get to travel the high seas. However, this might be the hardest part. The groups were always busy and it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. The part that had to be the most challenging for some members were caring for the animals during the crossings.  There are also fun times on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Usually we play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals are housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.  But being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than an adventure for some people. For most of our groups, it opened up the world to them. They stated that they were "grateful for the opporunity, and that it made them more aware of people of ther countries and their needs."  In conclusion, that is why you should join our Seagoing Cowboys program. Thank you for listening, and we hope to see you in the future!		0
 The cowboy has long been an icon of the American West. With their rugged appearance, sturdy mounts and wide-brimmed hats, they represent a bygone era of rugged individualism and adventure. In many popular films, cowboys are portrayed as fearless riders of the open range, but one cowboy stands out for his unique ability to ride the waves.   Surfing may seem far removed from the traditional image of the cowboy, but this sport has become increasingly popular in recent years, and there are many individuals who have taken up the sport and incorporated it into their lifestyles. One such individual is surfing cowboy, Laird Hamilton.   Hamilton first gained fame for his incredible skills on the water when he was featured in the film, "Beneath the Surface." In this film, Hamilton demonstrated his ability to ride towering waves with impressive ease, using a board that allowed him to stay above the water's surface. Hamilton's techniques and style quickly gained popularity, and he has since become one of the most influential figures in the world of water sports.  Laird Hamilton's career has been marked by a series of incredible achievements, both on and off the water. He has won numerous championships in surfing, windsurfing, and hydrofoilboarding, and has even set new world records in these disciplines. Hamilton's success has not been limited to competition, however, as he has also become a respected figure in the wider world of water sports, including big wave riding and rescue.  Hamilton's ability to ride the waves is truly remarkable, and it has earned him a place in the annals of surfing history. His combination of skill, technique, and sheer determination has inspired countless others to take up the sport and pursue their own adventures on the water.  In conclusion, the cowboy who rode the waves is a truly unique individual. Laird Hamilton has taken the traditional image of the cowboy and incorporated it into his own distinct style, blending his love of adventure and the outdoors with his passion for surfing. His achievements and accomplishments on and off the water are a testament to his skill and determination, and he continues to inspire others to pursue their own adventures and chase their dreams.		1
All throughout the world, experiments are taking place that replace the personal automobile with safer and more environment sensitive choices. Life in places, such as Vauban, Germany, is built around the lack of cars. Bogota, Colombia hosts their own Day Without Cars. Although this scale of events hasn't happened America yet, the youth of the United States aren't using cars as much as they used to. In all these cases, quality of life has improved and the environment isn't suffering as much as it previously did.  The residents of Vauban, Germany have made a monumental decision in the aspect of cars. According to the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , in the new district of Freiburg, the only cars that run in the streets are the trams that run to downtown Freiburg. This is done so that "stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway." This "smart planning" allows people to get to where they need to go without using cars. Placing busy businesses on a main street would normally be a bad idea because of the amount of congestion it would cause. In places like this, congestion isn't a thing that can happen. A walk could get you to central places allowing you to access the more important of places. The same article states that "passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emitions." The environment is in a state of constant decline with the amount of greenhouse gasses and chemicals we are exposing to it. The lack of cars is a great way to put us in the right direction. The article mentions that cars were responsible for "up to 50 percent of greenhouse gasses in some carintensive ares in the United States." Imagine how much clearer the sky would be with smog reduced by half. The implications of removing cars from our lives could mean the difference between severe global warming and living happy and healthy.  Three cities, deep within the Colombian urban areas, host a day where cars are not allowed. Andrew Selsky describes how "parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven,pitted sidewalks rushhour traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up." In Bogota, this singular day where cars were banned gave people a reason to try out public transportation and personal locomotion. Paris took a similar approach when, According to Robert Duffer, they "enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of he global city." Cars with evennumbered license plates were enforced to not be driven. The oddnumbered plates were the ones that were taken off the streets the next day. The two day ban allowed the environment to recover after extremely high smog levels. The rule that was applied in the Colombian cities was also enforced in the worldwide city of Paris. Both cities benefited greatly from a temporary ban of cars.  Car culture has always been strong within America. Elisabeth Rosunthal implies that for several decades, cars were a musthave object, but now, the youth are not as interested as the previous generations. Rosunthal shows how "America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miled driven in the United States peaked in 200 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspecive." If the largest cities stopped relying on cars as much, everybody would benefit. Even the car companies would have something to gain with advances in more personal vehicles such as bicycles. The environment would have an immense amount of weight taken off of its shoulders. In the US, where the 2nd highest source of environmental harm is cars, the impact would be monumental. The article relates that "people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume hte habit." Teens all across America are carpooling and finding new ways to help the environment while also getting to where they need to go.  Life is getting too busy. There is always something that needs to be done. Cars may help but there will never be enough hours in the day to do everything. Leaving personal transportation behind will be the next big step towards a more relaxed and stressless life. The advantages easily outweigh the disadvantages.		0
The new Facial action Coding System tells peoples emotions. I think it would be useful in a classroom. There is many reasons i think it would be useful. Im going to talk about why i belive it would be useful in this essay.  If you could tell how your students were feeling, it would make teaching easier. For example, if you were teaching and the computer told you all of your students were bored, then you could try to teach it in another way. Or if the computer told you all your students were exicted then you would know your doing a great job and you could teach that way more often. You would know what ways to teach to get the information into the students.  So what i think is that this computer could be really effective in a classrom. it would allow teachers to know if there students are even learning, how they feel about the way they teach, and lots more too. So if they could really use it in a classroom, im all for it.		0
Dear students,  I think that it is right for elementary school children to pick up there litter. In this letter i want to express that if you help pick up the litter it makes you a better person in heart and for you to say "no" to that is just terrible i know if someone would ask me if i wanted to pick up litter for them i would say "yes, I would because it keep's this place clean." But i do not think student's should be required to perform community service, yes it would be a good thing to help the area were u live but what if you have something to do or you have to be some where or need to do some for or with your family and friends i personally think that almost no body would want to do community service, probably in a room full of 20-25 people I think only about maybe 5 or 6 of the people in that very room would do it but the other 15 or 14 people wouldn't even try to see if they like it or if they feel good about it.  And as you know there has been many animal deaths because we don't pick up are trash or put it in a trash can we just drop it on the floor or ground, But say that you where a deer and you where really hungry and there was nothing to eat but when he spots a say Macdonald's rapper the deer would eat it the eventually be really sick or it could possibly die, And me, my sister RELATIVE_NAME  and my mother are in the Animal protection program "ASPCA" and we hate when people litter and we abolish it we want everybody to take that into consideration sincerely, STUDENT_NAME		0
While driverless cars do seem like a good idea, there are only a few things that I can think of that are bad about them. I feel that driverless cars are a good idea, and that the states or the majority of the states should be allowed to let the citizens have them. There are many differant reasons that I think driverless cars can be a good idea. I feel that they could help in many ways, and prove to be a good thing for many people.  One reason that I think driverless cars are a good idea is because there are some people who are blind and have appointments or jobs that they need to get to. With the help of a car that can fully drive itself people that are blind or have anyother thing wrong with them can get to places that they need to be without depending on another person to drive them around.  Another reason I think these cars would be a good idea is because if there is a person that wants to be wreckless when they drive, they will not be able to. With the car controlling where the person goes, if it is a fully driven by the computers, then they will not be able to do anything wreckless or cause any problems. Along with that there wouldnt be any problems with speeding or violating any laws while on the road. If a computer and a lot of sensors are controlling the car then the amount of problems on the road will decrease.  There are many problems that can be fixed because of fully self driving cars. With a few years and a lot more money we can have self driving cars. And with the help of many people working self driving cars we can make the roads not only safer, but we can also make more people with disabilities more free to do what they want.		0
Every four years since the founding of the United States, a president has been elected by the people to lead the U.S. According to source 1, the system used to select the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral College involves voters voting for president they want, as normal, and then the president that got the majority vote in that state gets all of that state's electoral votes. Supporters of the Electoral College claim that it is good that the presidents focus more on swing states, and that they are more likely to be the thoughtful voters, but there is zero evidence shown to support this, and it makes presidents focus on states disproportionally. The Electoral College should be abolished and replaced by the popular vote system, as it is an outdated method compared to modern technology, makes the vote of an individual seem even more insignificant, and makes presidents not campaign in states that are small or loyal to them.  Since the Electoral College was hundreds of years ago, it does not account for all of the new technologies that have been developed since then. The founding fathers could not have possibly thought that it would be possible to easily count all of the nation's votes with a machine, but now it is possible. It is likely that the reason they thought of the Electoral College in the first place was because it would mean that they could spread out the tallying of votes between the states, instead of doing it all at once. Nowadays though, there are computers that can count votes faster than ever imagined. Popular vote is now a viable method since every person's vote can be accurately counted.  Due to the Electoral College relying on a majority rules system, the vote of a single person can be completely insignificant. According to source 3, a supporter of the Electoral College, "Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...." This should not be the case when voting. Voters should research their choice as if the election relied completely on them. But instead, there is a system in place where somebody's vote can be rendered completely useless in not multiple ways! For example, if a state already has their majority of citizens voting for president A, if somebody votes for president B it will be as if they didn't vote at all! Even in a case where the state is completely 50:50 on who to give the electoral votes to, if the last person votes for president A, tipping the majority in his favor, according to source 2, "... those electors could always defy the will of the people," and end up voting for President B. The Electoral College is an anti-thesis to democracy, because a citizen's vote can be rendered completely pointless at multiple points.  Both those who support the Electoral College system and those who oppose it agree that the Electoral College puts a much bigger focus on swing states and states with large populations, according to sources 2 and 3. To put this into perspective, here's an example of why supporting big swing states should not be rewarded. The US has 6 states. 5 are completely democrats and each have populations of 20. 1 is half democrat half republican and has a population of 100(assume 20 people equals an electoral vote). If the republican presidential candidate convinces a single democrat in the big state to vote for them, they will get the majority vote in that state and get 5 electoral votes. This results in the democratic presidential candidate, with 149 people supporting him, tying with the republican presidential candidate, with 51 people supporting him. Simple logic shows that the opinion of 149 people is more important than that of 51 people, so a popular vote system would have been best in this situation. The focus on certain states is such a popular method by the presidential candidates, that, according to source 2, "During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all..."Big states and swing states should not receive much more attention per citizen from the presidential candidates than little states do.  In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems "easier," no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.    		0
 The electoral college is a system used in the United States to elect the President. It was established under the U.S. Constitution and was meant to balance out the influence of large states and small states, urban areas and rural areas, and between the North and South. However, the system has been the subject of much discussion and debate in recent years, with some people calling for it to be abolished and others calling for reform. In this essay, we will examine the electoral college and examine its effectiveness in electing the President.  One of the main arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it allows for the voice of small states to be heard. Under the system, each state has a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. This means that even states with a small population can have a significant say in the election. For example, in the 2016 election, Texas, a state with a population of 28,495,881, had 38 electoral votes, while Wyoming, a state with a population of just 579,474, had three electoral votes. This allows for a more balanced representation of the country in the electoral college, as smaller states are not overshadowed by the voices of bigger states.  Another argument in favor of the electoral college is that it prevents a candidate from winning the presidency simply by winning in densely populated urban areas. In this system, a candidate must win at least 270 electoral votes to become President. This means that a candidate cannot win by simply winning in large cities and ignoring smaller states. For example, in the 2000 election, Al Gore won in many urban areas, but lost the electoral vote to George W. Bush due to the importance of Ohio and Florida. This helps to ensure that Presidential candidates do not write off smaller states and can actually campaign in the Midwest and South.  However, there are also many arguments in favor of abolishing the electoral college. One of the main arguments is that it does not accurately represent the will of the people. Under the system, the President can win the electoral vote or lose it despite losing the popular vote. For example, in the 2000 election, Al Gore won the popular vote, receiving 48.6% of the vote, but lost the electoral vote to George W. Bush due to his victory in Florida. This means that the electoral college does not always reflect the will of the American people, and people may feel frustrated with the system if Presidential candidates do not campaign in the states they think they can win.  Another argument in favor of abolishing the electoral college is that it creates an incentive for candidates to ignore certain states in favor of others. This is because candidates focus on winning swing states with the most electoral votes, instead of winning nationally. For example, in the 2008 election, John McCain spent less time campaigning in swing states like Ohio and Florida, and more time campaigning in battleground states like Michigan and Colorado. This can be seen as a waste of time, as candidates should be campaigning nationally in order to win the hearts and minds of voters from all states.  In conclusion, the electoral college is a system used to elect the President of the United States. It was designed to balance out the influence of large states and small states, and between the North and South. While it has its advantages, such as allowing for the voice of small		1
While distance learning provides flexibility, attending classes from home does not offer all of the same benefits as in-person learning. There are a few key reasons why in-person classes are often preferable for students.   One major advantage of in-person classes is the social interaction and collaboration that occurs. In a traditional classroom setting, students can work together on group projects, have discussions with their peers, and build social relationships. Distance learning removes these opportunities for real-time collaboration and relationship building. Many students benefit from the socialization that comes with attending school in person.   Another benefit of the classroom is accountability. When attending classes at school, students have set class times each day that keep them on a routine and schedule. It can be easier for students attending classes from home to become distracted or procrastinate schoolwork without this structure. Distance learning requires more self-discipline from students to stay focused on their work without in-person supervision.   Additionally, in-person classes allow for more direct support from teachers. When students have questions or need help, teachers are immediately available to provide guidance, feedback and assistance. Distance learning puts more responsibility on students to independently seek help as needed. Some students may struggle without the face-to-face support of their teachers.   While distance learning provides flexibility that can help students in some situations, attending classes in the traditional classroom setting tends to offer higher accountability, opportunities for collaboration, and support from both teachers and peers that benefit many students. Overall, for most students, in-person classes better support learning and development. However, distance learning could be useful as a supplement or option for some highly self-motivated students. A combination of both models may work best to support all types of learners.		1
Dear Senator, the election is coming up soon and so is voting. The Electoral College and the popular vote get to select the president of the United States every year. I want this year to be a little different. This year I would like to see only the Electoral College vote for the president. The Electoral College knows all about thinking if the president is good enough for the country, and if he can be a good role model, or also a commander in chief. That is the reason why I would like to keep the Electoral College.  I would like the country to keep the Electoral College because they make good desiciosns, know if the candidate person is the right president, and last but not least they might think if the citizens would like this president based on his promises that he would like to keep. For example there are two candidates fighting to be president and it's time to vote and the Electoral College might look over¬† to see if the president looks like he can keep his promise to keep the coutnry safe, to make this a better country or not . That's what they look for in a president. That's the reason wwhy we should keep the Electoral College.  When the citizens want to vote for the president as well, they think of the same thing, if he's good enough for our country, and if he is going to keep us safe. The Electoral College knows a lot about picking the right president and they've been doing it for a long time.  "The Electoral College consits of 538 electors and a¬† majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. That's enough electors to vote wether or not the president should be this person or that person.       ¬†       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    		0
My essay will be about a situation two years ago when I was a junior in high school. I had been very interested in the school's theater department, but I was too intimidated to audition for any shows. I knew that if I auditioned, I would likely be cast in a smaller role, and I was afraid I wouldn't do well enough. I talked to a close friend who was very passionate about theater and I could see that they wanted to encourage me to audition, but I couldn't work up the courage to actually do it.   I believe the reason I was unsuccessful with participating in the school theater productions was because I was afraid of failure and I didn't have enough confidence in my own abilities. My lack of self-confidence kept me from taking action and kept me from fulfilling a potential passion. If I had pushed myself to step outside my comfort zone, I believe I could have achieved success.  If I had made a different decision two years ago and taken the risk of auditioning, it is possible that I could have gained a greater understanding of theater and my own skillset. In addition, my friend would have likely been proud to see me giving it my all and succeeding. Instead, I remained in my comfort zone, and my hesitation to take the risk caused me to remain inthat area and to miss out on an amazing opportunity.		1
The innovations in the field of facial recognition and analysis have expanded beyond just identifying someone based on a picture. Now, computers with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can identify human emotions from facial expressions. This innovation would be a valuable asset if used in a classroom environment due to it making it easier on teachers and helping student actually understand and learn the material.  One reason this technology would be valuable in the classroom is the aid it would provide to teachers. FACS can recognize when students are confused or bored by analyzing their facial expressions and each "action unit," which is movement of one or more facial muscles. No teacher can always recognize when a student is zoned out or confused, which is why employing FACS to do it for the teachers would be extremely valuable. One of the primary developers of the technology, Dr. Huang, says, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." By recognizing boredom or confusion and notifying the teacher, FACS helps teachers be able to recognize when their lesson is not being effectively heard by their students. FACS also changes the lesson plan when it recognizes that a student is bored or confused, which helps the teacher keep the class engaged and allows them to participate more. Thus, FACS would be valuable in the classroom due to the help it would give teachers by enhancing their lesson.  Another reason FACS would be valuable in the classroom is that it would tremendously help students actually understand what they are learning. Students do not always understand what they are being taught, and even though they might not understand they often do not ask questions to clarify. This means that students are basically just being talked at, with it all just going above their heads. However, when FACS recognizes that a student doesn't understand or is bored it "... could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor," says Dr. Huang. This means that when a student needs help understanding something the computer will cater to each student until it senses that they understand the lesson. This could drastically improve participation and engagement in the classroom by ensuring that each student understands. Thus, FACS would be valuable in the classroom due to it helping students learn more effectively.  Through its ability to help both teachers and students, FACS would be a valuable asset in the classroom. Sitting in classrooms around the world right now are students who do not understand what they are being taught. This could be changed forever with the implementation of FACS in the classroom, with a smaller percentage of students failing classes and a higher level of understanding being a direct result from the implementation of FACS.                		0
 The idea of limiting car usage has been gaining popularity in recent years as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. The passage set provides several examples of cities and countries that have implemented car-free initiatives with varying levels of success. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage and address potential counterclaims.  One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a significant source of pollution, contributing to climate change. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease the amount of emissions released into the atmosphere. For example, the city of Vauban in Germany has implemented a car-free policy, which has resulted in a significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of smog, resulting in a 60% reduction in congestion.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. Cars emit pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease the amount of pollutants released into the air, leading to improved air quality. For example, Bogota, Colombia has implemented a car-free day, resulting in a significant decrease in air pollution.  However, there are potential counterclaims to limiting car usage. Some argue that it is not practical or feasible to completely eliminate cars from society. Additionally, some argue that limiting car usage would negatively impact the economy, as many jobs are related to the automotive industry.  Despite these counterclaims, it is important to note that limiting car usage is not a complete elimination of cars, but rather a reduction in their usage. This can be achieved through a variety of means, such as implementing car-free days, promoting public transportation, and encouraging the use of alternative modes of transportation such as biking and walking.  Furthermore, the automotive industry has the potential to adapt to this change by focusing on the development of more environmentally friendly vehicles and promoting alternative modes of transportation. For example, the city of Bogota has seen an increase in the number of bike paths and the development of new restaurants and shopping districts as a result of the car-free day.  In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the improvement of air quality. While there may be potential counterclaims, it is important to note that limiting car usage is not a complete elimination of cars, but rather a reduction in their usage. With the implementation of car-free policies and the development of more environmentally friendly vehicles, we can work towards a more sustainable future.		1
[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP] [Date]  [State Senator's Name] [Address Line 1] [City, State, ZIP]  Subject: In Support of Keeping the Electoral College  Dear [State Senator's Name],  I am writing to express my strong support for the continued utilization of the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. While many argue for changing to a system of popular vote, I firmly believe that the Electoral College has numerous benefits that warrant its preservation.  First and foremost, the Electoral College offers certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As proven by historical data, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the national popular vote. This ensures that a single state or region does not have undue influence in electing the President. This principle is crucial to maintaining a fair and equitable democratic process.  Furthermore, the use of the Electoral College ensures that the President is chosen with trans-regional appeal. No single region in the country possesses enough electoral votes to elect a President, effectively preventing a candidate with only regional support from assuming office. This requirement encourages presidential candidates to campaign across the nation, taking into consideration the interests and concerns of all American citizens.  The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes under the Electoral College system also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This increases voter engagement and ensures that candidates dedicate their time and resources to listening and addressing the concerns of voters in these pivotal states. In turn, this leads to a more informed electorate and a greater likelihood of presidential candidates making well-rounded and inclusive decisions.  Moreover, the Electoral College provides a balance in political power between large and small states. By awarding electoral votes based on population, larger states maintain the weight they deserve in the political process. This balance is essential to prevent a tyranny of the majority and to promote fairness and representation across the country.  Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the presidential election process. With this system, a clear winner is determined, even if they do not have a majority of the popular vote. This ensures stability in the election process and prevents prolonged uncertainty and further division among the American people.  While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states they deem 'unwinnable,' it is important to note that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high, regardless of the Electoral College system. People vote to express their political preferences, not solely in hopes of swinging a national election with a single vote.  In conclusion, it is clear that the Electoral College provides several advantages that foster a fair and balanced presidential election process. Its ability to produce a clear winner, promote trans-regional appeal, enhance voter engagement, balance political power, and avoid run-off elections make it a valuable institution in our democracy. I urge you to preserve the Electoral College and advocate for its continued use in the selection of the President of the United States.  Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I appreciate your dedication to serving our state and its citizens.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Sure thing! Here's my essay:  Hey there! So, I've been thinking a lot about skills and how they can help us grow as people. And I realized that I've actually mastered one skill that I'm really proud of - playing the guitar! It's been a few years now since I started learning, and I've put in a ton of practice time. I mean, I'm not a rockstar or anything, but I can play some pretty cool songs and I even write my own music sometimes.  But here's the thing - I don't want to just stop at being good at the guitar. I want to get even better! So, my goal is to start taking lessons with a professional guitar teacher. I know it will be tough, but I'm determined to learn even more advanced techniques and improve my skills. And I'm not just going to stop at lessons - I'm going to practice every day, even if it's just for a few minutes. It might not seem like a lot, but every little bit helps!  And you know what the coolest part is? When I started playing the guitar, I never thought I'd be able to do it. It seemed like something that only cool people could do, but now I'm actually good at it! It's shown me that if I put my mind to something, I can accomplish it. And that's so important to remember.  I mean, think about it - if we don't challenge ourselves, we'll never know how good we can really be. We'll just stick with what we're good at and never try anything new. And that's not living life to the fullest! So, even if it's scary or hard, we should always try to push ourselves and see what we're capable of.  In conclusion, mastering a skill is super important because it shows us what we're capable of and helps us grow as people. And even though it might be hard, it's totally worth it in the end. So, let's all go out there and master something! üé∏üí™		1
It's not a secret that we as humans use cars to get places. The mall, the grocery store, school, work. All these places may be too far to walk to, or just too much of a hassle to not use a car to get to. This is why vehicles have long been a main export and very commonly seen sight in the world. But what are they costing us? To name a few, vehicles are costing us clean air, time, and money that we are not going to get back easily, unless we change our bad habits. That's why limiting car usage is so beneficial to us as a population, not only for ourselves but for future generations as well. Putting a cap on driving will help us with the large amount of emissions that is put out every day, it will reduce jams and increase safety, and it will be less expensive. Cars are a dirty form of transportation that need to be controlled better.  Along the lines of dirty, cars give off a gross amount of emissions into the atmosphere. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States." Cars, because they are used so much and so densely in the world, give off the highest amount of carbon emissions, second only to power plants. This is detrimental to our atmosphere and puts a serious weight on the air around us. Smog has started to get to escalate the extremes. "After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." as stated by Robert Duffer in an article detailing the heavy smog that rivaled even Beijing, China, often known as one of the most polluted cities globally. The fiveday restriction on driving was implemented to, basically, give the air a rest after the intenseness of the trapped smog in the city reached 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter, compared with brussels 114 and London's 79.7. If we were to enforce this rule of reduced drivinhg everywhere, the amount of deducted pollution would be astronomical. It would be healthier for both the environment and for us humans.  Also being safer for humans would be the lower amount and intensity of traffic jams that would come with a restrictive hold on cars. With only exceptions for plugin cars, hybrids, cars carrying three or more people, and public transportation, traffic jams would be nearly nonexistent. Examples have already been seen in places where restrictions have been implemented. "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France," stated by Duffer of the ban on cars for the fiveday pollutuion scare. Another big example is written my Andrew Selsky, and he states, "In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or too buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of Bogota, Colombia eerily devoid of traffic jams." Densely populated cities and highways are extremey dangerous, both for cars that may get into accidents and for the pedestrians that may be present. With a reduction of cars, the danger of being hit is lowered greatly. It also saves time, due to jams and high volumes of traffic bogging of streets gone. Walking and biking would be safer, and for the few who drive smartly, such as with a hybrid, the traffic would be all but gone as well. Health expenses and potential hospital bills would be avoided, and ease of getting where you need to go would be stressfree and simple.  On the important topic of less expenses, this leads into the final claim. Along with the restrictions of cars use comes less expenses, something we all want. Elisabeth Rosenthal writes, "...the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explaination certainly lies in the recession, because cashstrapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and apprears to be persisting now that the recovery is underway." This shows that the lessened use of cars has lead to an increase in money, and people are continuing to go through with this idea. Money is important to us, it is our lifeline in this cashoriented world. Without it, we live poorly, in all senses of the word.  To end off, driving is not something absolutely needed in our world. It strips us of smogfree environments, time, safety, and money. Putting a cap on driving will help us with the large amount of emissions that is put out every day, it will reduce jams and increase safety, and it will be less expensive in our daily lives. To reduce driving is to increse our standard of living.		0
Several people in the United States do not participate in extracurricular activities. Most of them sit at home, play video games, and don't do much in the community. They basically only come in contact with other people at school. But what if these activities where required? Required extracurricular activities would allow them to be communicating with other people all the time, not just at school. I think required extracurricular activities are a fabulous idea because they build friendships, keep students active, and progress social skills.  First of all, after school programs let you see your friends and possibly make new ones. This will help strengthen the relationship between you and your friends. Also, when participating in extracurricular activities, you meet all sorts of new people. I know when I played basketball, I met several new people from other schools, and I know a lot of the players from other schools now. It got me in public more often, and that's better for you than staying home watching screens all day.  Secondly, I think that extracurricular activities are good for keeping people active. For example, if you chose basketball as you after school activity, you would be running in practice, going up and down the court during games, and that would lead you to getting in better shape. They would also stay active in the community, because several of the activities involve people in the community. Things such as sporting events would involve crowds of¬†people coming to watch and support their teams. In addition, being active and playing sport would help lower obesity, which is starting to be a problem in some schools. The running and jumping, and just getting up and doing things after school help you lose weight.  Thirdly, these activities would build social skills, as being out in public surrounded by other people force you to talk, and slowly build social skills. Social skills are used for everything in life, from making friends to getting a job. They are extremely useful for doing anything in life. Going back to making friends, these skills will make it a million times easier to do so, because communication would come naturally, and you would seem more friendly. And since most of these activities involve being in the community more often and meeting new people, it doesn't hurt to have this particular set of skills..  Lastly, I believe that I have proven that required extracurricular activities are useful, productive, and better for you than laying in bed or watching television. They develop friendships, keep you active, and produce social skills. Making friends in life is important, and after school programs help you make some lifelong accomplices. The social skills you learn might help you get a future job, and will most definitely help you with life in general. I hope many people view required activities differently, and will see the reason behind them.		0
Though there is no one activity that can provide every benefit, the outdoors offer a variety of activities that can be tailored to suit any individual's lifestyle and health goals. Activities such as biking, running, swimming, and hiking have numerous benefits that range from lower stress levels to providing a full-body workout. Even something as simple as taking a walk or going for a picnic can help improve mental health and foster a sense of connection with nature.   Additionally, spending time outdoors provides opportunities to connect with family, friends, and potential new acquaintances. Setting a plan for people to get fit while enjoying the outdoors doesn't have to be limited to exercise. Consider also creating opportunities to help those in need, such as donating old outdoor gear or participating in a park clean-up. Being outdoors doesn't have to be boring. With the right planning, it can be a fun and rewarding multi-faceted experience.		1
As an eighth-grade student, I believe that students should have the right to choose what elective classes they take. Forcing every student to take every class can be a waste of time for both teachers and students.  Firstly, students have different interests and talents, and forcing them to take every class can lead to a lack of engagement and motivation in the classroom. If a student is not interested in a particular subject, they are less likely to learn and perform well in that class. On the other hand, if a student is passionate about a subject, they are more likely to excel and contribute to the class.  Secondly, teachers should be able to focus on their area of expertise and teach classes that they are passionate about. If every teacher is forced to teach every class, they may not be able to give their best effort and provide the best education for their students. This can lead to a lack of quality in the classroom and a waste of time for both the teacher and the student.  Lastly, forcing every student to take every class can limit the opportunities for students to explore their interests and pursue their passions. Students should be able to choose elective classes that align with their interests and goals. This can lead to a more well-rounded education and a greater chance of success in the future.  In conclusion, students should have the right to choose what elective classes they take. Forcing every student to take every class can lead to a lack of engagement, a waste of time for teachers, and limited opportunities for students. It is important for students to be able to pursue their passions and interests in the classroom, and for teachers to be able to focus on their area of expertise.		1
The electoral college needs to be kept, it is the easiest way to vote for a presidential canidate. People may not like it because the people who are voting for a president really are not voting for the¬† president, their voting for the electors to vote for the president. Which makes sense, but the electoral college is simple and yet very reliable in many ways people dont see.  The electoral college is based of popularity in a state. I¬† can see why people dont like that because certain states like florida has the maximum of 29 electoral votes, but wyoming only has a maximum of 3 electoral votes. The presidential canidates look for states that have the most electoral votes, but they also need more votes than the other canidate so every vote counts.  Citizens may think that the canidates dont care about their state, but they do in more ways than you think. The electoral college has a requirement, trans-regional appeal, which means that a canidate is popular in a certain region of the U.S for example, Mitt Romney he was the most popular in the south in 2012's election. Romney did not canpain heavily in the south so he did not gain any electoral votes by increasing his popularity in the states he knows he would win in.  The electoral college is definatly something to argue about but in my opinion it should be kept. The Electoral college may seem a bit unfair but its also the most easiest desion making tool when it comes to electing. Its been around for years it would make no sense to get rid of it.    		0
Limiting car usage has many benefits for both communities and the environment. Reducing reliance on personal vehicles can help address issues like traffic, pollution, and climate change. Using alternatives like public transportation, biking, or walking allows cities to become more sustainable while improving citizens' health and quality of life.  Traffic congestion is a major problem faced by many cities around the world. With more people driving everyday, roads have become overcrowded, leading to increased travel times and frustration for drivers. According to Passage 1, a study found that people in cities like London and New York spend an average of over 200 hours stuck in traffic each year. By taking public transit, biking, or walking for short trips instead of driving, there will be fewer cars on the road. This reduces traffic and makes commutes smoother and more reliable for those who need to drive.  In addition to traffic, car emissions are a significant source of air pollution in urban areas. Passage 2 discusses how vehicle emissions release harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter into the atmosphere. These pollutants have been linked to health issues like respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular diseases. By limiting car usage and opting for alternative modes of transportation, communities can improve air quality and residents' health outcomes. With fewer vehicles on the road each day pumping out emissions, the air will be cleaner to breathe.   Moreover, reducing reliance on personal vehicles helps tackle the global climate crisis. As outlined in Passage 3, transportation is a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. When many people drive gas-guzzling cars everyday, it releases a substantial amount of carbon dioxide into the environment. Choosing active transportation, public transit, or ride-sharing over single-occupancy vehicles lowers fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions from the transportation sector. This mitigates climate change by lessening humanity's carbon footprint. Future generations will benefit from current actions taken to limit car usage.  In conclusion, limiting car usage through the promotion of alternatives like public transit, biking, and walking provides many advantages. It can help alleviate issues such as traffic congestion, air pollution, and climate change while also improving public health and well-being. Citizens should consider reducing their personal car trips where possible to make cities more sustainable for themselves and future communities. Overall, limiting car usage has significant environmental and social benefits that can positively impact both current and future generations.		1
Driverless cars, am I for or against the idea of them? I am against the thought of driverless cars for two main reasons. One, drunk drivers and two, kids using the cars.  Technology has been becoming more advanced over the years from phones all the way up to cars now. In paragraph four lines one through two says, "Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars."  Smarter cars are not going to make the world safer because not everyone will be able to afford the new "smart car". These new "smart cars" will probably be hybrids running on electricity instead of gas. Which will make gas prices for normal cars sky rocket.  Now thinking of driving safely that means no drinking, texting, or sometimes even eating. With these driverless cars more than likely people will go out to drink and take there driverless car with them thinking it will still be safe to drive even though they have been drinking. Just because the car drives by its self you still have to hold the wheel. "special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel." paragraph seven line three. Thinking of safety also includes the protection of kids. Teens will think that it's okay to take their parents driverless car because all they will have to do is hold the wheel which is wrong because in paragraph seven lines six through eight reads "They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents." In conclusion the driverless car would not be safe for this generation. 		0
Gun control is a really important topic that affects us all. As a grade 10 student, I believe that stricter gun control laws are necessary to ensure the safety of our communities.  Firstly, it's important to note that the availability of firearms can lead to an increase in gun-related violence and crime. In countries where gun ownership is prevalent, there is a higher risk of gun-related incidents, such as mass shootings, homicides, and suicides. For example, in the United States, there were over 40,000 deaths due to firearms in 2020 alone. Stricter gun control laws would limit the availability of firearms to only those who are authorized and licensed to own them, thereby reducing the risk of such incidents.  Secondly, stricter gun control laws can help to reduce the number of mass shootings that occur. Mass shootings are becoming increasingly common in countries where gun ownership is widespread, and they can have a devastating impact on families and communities. For example, the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, which killed 51 people and injured many more, highlight the need for stricter gun control laws. By implementing universal background checks, red flag laws, and limiting access to certain types of firearms, we can reduce the likelihood of such tragedies occurring.  Thirdly, stricter gun control laws can help to reduce gun-related suicides. Studies have shown that states with stricter gun control laws have lower rates of gun-related suicides. This is because access to firearms is often a factor in suicide, and limiting access can help to prevent impulsive decisions that can have devastating consequences.  Finally, stricter gun control laws can help to reduce gun trafficking and organized crime. By implementing stricter regulations on the sale and transfer of firearms, we can prevent illegal firearms from entering the black market and being used for nefarious purposes. This can help to reduce drug-related violence and gang activity, making our communities safer.  In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides of the gun control debate, I firmly believe that stricter gun control laws are necessary to ensure the safety of our communities. By limiting access to firearms, reducing the number of mass shootings, reducing gun-related suicides, and reducing gun trafficking and organized crime, we can create a safer and more peaceful society for everyone.		1
Some schools will assign students projects over summer break to assure they will continue to learn school subjects. Summer is a long time and will give the students enough time to learn what is needed. There is a small debate as to whether the students or the teachers should design these projects. Although many teachers will assign and create these projects because they can make sure the students will learn what they need to learn, students should design these projects because many teachers will give to big of a project, many students might not have enough time to work on said project, and giving the student the ability to create the project will assure it can get done.  The first reason to support this claim is that teachers may give to big of a project. Normally, teacher will give a student a project to work on and learn but there is no telling how big that project could be. The teacher could say to create 1 deck of study cards or to write a 10 page essay on something that student may not have learned about. And many times the student may not get the project done in a way the teacher likes because they did not get a chance to go over something like that. Lastly, sometimes the student can get anxious or nervous about having to create a project as big or small as the teacher assigns.  Secondly, a student may not have the time to work on a big project. Teachers look forward to the summer just as much as kids do. Summer is a time to hang out with family or earn some money at a job. Many students simply will not have enough time to worry about creating a big school project. Everyone has responsibilities, like work, family, or just household tasks, and lots of people can not make enough time to work on summer projects. Also depending on how big the assigned project will be and how many teachers assign projects can be to much and give a student not enough time to complete them all.  Lastly, if a students designs a project they can make it so that it can revolve around their schedule. A teacher will normally give students a big project and expect it to be done without thinking about how a student has a life outside of school just like a teacher. For the majority of students, they are too busy with summer responsibilities to be able to work on a teacher assigned school project. If a student is given the right to create their own project, following some small steps from the teacher, there is a higher chance that the student will get the project done rather than not complete it.  In conclusion, students should be able to assign and create their own projects. Many reasons include how big the project is, how much time it will take, and how much time the student can work on it. So to make it easier on everyone, students should be able to make their own projects that can revolve around their own lives and responsibilities.¬†		0
The world is facing incredibly drastic climate change due to car emissions and power plants, both are burning fossil fuels. Things may look bad, almost irreversible but the sun has not yet set, there's hope and it comes in the shape of a shifting world wide attitude towards vehicles. Governments are focusing on making green zones designed to limit car use. There are a plethora of positive effects that this may have on society. Reducing the temperature of a rapidly heating planet will allow us to savour our oceans rather than running from them as they grow to envelop our costal cities. It will relieve stress from those who had been trapped in a car all day and last, but not least, it's not difficult and one wont be alone in their endeavors.  To begin, cars emit green house gasses which will accumulate in our atmosphere trapping heat underneath it as it tries to leave our planet. This leads to a cumulative effect that causes the earth's average temperature to rise. In Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars Elizabeth Rosenthal says "Green house gas emitions from cars in America make up fifty percent of all greenhouse gas emitions in the country." America barely has any regulations in relation to greenhouse gas emitions to start with but this is crazy. This problem could be easily solved with a few regulations and some smart city planning. The benefits of this includes but is not limited to, more temperate climate, less airborne carcinogens and of course no crazy drivers.  Another good reason to switch is riding a bike or travelling on a train or bus is much more relaxing than rapidly driving down the highway being cut off by rude drivers and endangering yourself simply by merging. instead you can leisurely wait to arrive at your destination. In German Suburb Elisabeth Rosenthal writes a quote from an interview which says "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm so much happier now." This media trainer said this as she walked the streets of Verdant "where the swish of bicycles and chatter of wandering children drowned out the occasional distant motor." This is beautiful, borderline serene, only a crazy person would disagree with such an environment.  Now traveling all the way across the world, from Germany to Columbia. These countries are both spearheading the experiments with pollution reduction and in Bogata The capital of Columbia, they actually organize "Car free days" seven million people in Bogota alone participated in the event, violaters would even have to pay a 25 fine. According to Andrew Selsky, the author of Car Free Day Is Spinning Into A Big Hit In Bogoto, "Even the rain hasn't stopped people from participating." It seems that, rightfully, this event is treated as a celebration and it has great effects on the environment.  In conclusion these every one should follow suit with this beautiful and healthy way of tackling environmental issues. If people stay on track it will be easy, fun, relaxing and the Earth will be admired for many years to come.		0
 Venus, the second planet from the sun, has long captured the attention of space explorers and scientists alike. As the Earth's sister planet, Venus has many similarities in terms of size, composition, and atmosphere. However, there are also many differences between the two planets, making Venus a fascinating subject for exploration. In this essay, we will explore some of the key aspects of Venus that make it a compelling target for space missions.  One of the first things to consider when exploring Venus is its atmosphere. Unlike Earth, Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide gas, with clouds of sulfuric acid that can reach temperatures as high as 460  C. This dense atmosphere traps heat and creates a greenhouse effect, making Venus the hottest planet in our solar system. In fact, the surface temperature of Venus can reach up to 470  C, which is hot enough to melt lead.  Another important aspect of Venus is its surface features. While the planet's thick atmosphere makes it difficult to see from space, scientists have noticed some interesting patterns on Venus' surface. These patterns include vast volcanic mountains, deep canyons, and large impact craters that suggest that Venus has experienced significant geological activity in the past.  In addition to its atmosphere and surface features, Venus also has a very slow rotation period. It takes Venus 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, which is much slower than the 24 hours it takes Earth to rotate. This slow rotation period is likely due to the planet's thick atmosphere, which can slow down the movement of the rotation axis.  Despite the many challenges of exploring Venus, scientists and space agencies are already planning missions to the planet. The European Space Agency's Venus Express mission, launched in 2005, has been studying the planet's atmosphere and surface features from orbit. In 2010, NASA's Venus Reconnaissance Orbiter (VRO) was launched to investigate Venus' surface in more detail and to study the planet's atmosphere from a closer distance.  In conclusion, Venus is a fascinating target for space exploration due to its many similarities and differences with Earth. From its thick, carbon dioxide atmosphere to its vast volcanic mountains and slow rotation period, Venus is a unique and challenging environment to explore. Despite the many challenges, scientists and space agencies are already planning missions to Venus, and we can expect to learn even more about this intriguing planet in the future.		1

Also you could help people from the war and solders. So why wouldn't you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy?                          		0
People ask for advice on a daily basis, But is asking more then one person to much advice. You need more then one persons advice for different¬†things and everybody has an opinion on different things so you should as multiple people for any advice you need. There can be people who agree with you and who dont agree with you so its always good to know both sides of the story.  Lets say you want a new pet so you ask 5 of your friends what you should get between a puppy and a grown dog, You might want a puppy but not all your friends might agree with you,3 out of 5 friends say you should get a puppy because it is energetic and you can see it grow and it will be loyal to you because it has been your puppy for along time,2 out of 5 friends say you should get a grown up dog because it will be trained and it will not pee in your house as much as puppies do,both sides of your friends gave very good advice so now you can think about what you really want.  Getting advice from more then one person like you mom and from your dad you can ask them how a dress looks on you,your mom will know what to look at like how your body looks in it how it fits you all these things but you dad on the other hand wont say as much as your mom he might just say it looks nice without really looking at every little detail on your dress.  Getting more then one opnion isnt as bad as some people might think its very helpful if you dont know what to do or think at some giving point its alright you never know what you might hear or find out so it all works out in the end game.		0
many of peolpe own and drive cars, everyday. For some people having a car is very impotant to their lifestyle. when buying a car peopl tell you that having aa car is great , but do they tell you the other effects it can have on your¬†physically. having a car not only affects your daily life but allso affects your environment.  have you ever heard of the greenhouse affect, global warming and air pollution? the abundant usage of cars have a large affect on those vital things in our environment . In cities like paris , because of the air pollution caused by cars, there is very dense smog ( source2 ). Air pollution is very important because the toxins in burnig fuel can be harmful to the healthof citizens. smog is not only a problem in paris , but all over the world . places like paris and Bogato have created things like car day , to discourage th e use of cars, because of that the air polluston on these places have reduced dramatically .(source 2 and 3). due to the efforts to reduce car usage , the smog and othe pollutions clearded up uthe air which showed that not using your car for one day can be tramindasly helpful to your environment.  In the United states the automoblie industry is huge, and having a car is one of the things that many citizens hold dear to their daily life. recently things have started to chang in the U.S . ¬†government is starting to realize the affects of having millons of cars in our country is gaving on our environment(source 4 ). since the expansion od suburbs th¬†¬†¬†       ¬†       ¬†    		0
Dear Principal,  Many students would like to play sports but have a C average, they would like to have a career in sports but are unable to because you could only play if you have a B average. That is unfair to them because they are good athletes but can's get their chance to shine because they have C' s so I say that it should be a C average because they're passing their classes and want a reward for that, and the reward is to play sports. I say you should let them play so they can get what they deserve.  Many kids play well in football, soccer, basketball etc. and would be good for the team but are unable to do good for their school. Do you really want that, for your team to look bad because they don't have good athletes? I say let them play and make this school look good. I know you would want that but right now you're making this school look really bad because the teams aren't doing any good. Let them play to make them and the school shine like it never has. Change it to a C average and the teams would be really good and this school would be one of the best. They're doing their best in classes and they should get rewarded big time like let them play on the teams and they would make you proud.  This is your chance to make this school shine so don't let it pass take advantage of it and let them on the teams. People miss their chance to shine and these kids are missing their chance because they are unable to play. Do you want to take that from them, their joy in life? So don't make a fool out of yourself and don't make this school a shame. Let them play so they don't miss their chance to shine, let them take advantage of it not let it go to waste. If they miss their chance, it wont come back they would never see it again and would never shine and are unable to make their families proud of their children. Don't take that away from them give it to them, do this and you, the students and the school would be the best there is. So change it from a B average to a C average and let them shine.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
As an eighth-grade student, it is important to understand the potential benefits of seeking professional guidance versus making your own decisions. In today's world, it is easy to rely on technology and social media to make decisions, but it is important to consider the values and life matters that are most important to you.  The first step in making an informed decision is to understand the potential benefits of seeking professional guidance. Seeking guidance from experts can provide a fresh perspective on a situation, as well as access to knowledge and resources that may not be available to you. Additionally, seeking guidance can help you avoid making decisions that may have negative consequences, such as financial or legal issues.  The second step in making an informed decision is to list the values and life matters that are most important to you. For me, my values include honesty, integrity, and respect for others. These values are important to me because they guide my actions and help me make decisions that align with my personal beliefs. Additionally, my life matters most to me include my family, friends, and my education. These are important to me because they provide a sense of belonging and purpose in my life.  The third step in making an informed decision is to compare making your own decisions to seeking guidance from experts. While making your own decisions can be empowering and provide a sense of autonomy, it can also be risky and lead to negative consequences. On the other hand, seeking guidance from experts can provide a sense of security and help you avoid making decisions that may have negative consequences. However, it is important to note that seeking guidance should not replace making your own decisions, as it is important to develop your own skills and independence.  In conclusion, making your own decisions is important for you as it allows you to develop your own skills and independence. Additionally, understanding the potential benefits of seeking professional guidance can help you make informed decisions that align with your values and life matters. It is important to find a balance between making your own decisions and seeking guidance from experts, as both have their own unique benefits and drawbacks. Ultimately, the key to making informed decisions is to understand your own values and life matters, and to seek guidance when necessary.		1
For centuries, man has been fascinated by the stars in the sky. From the earliest civilizations, people looked to the skies for answers. They worshipped the flaming sun and glowing moon. Later, this worship subsided, and looking to the skies took on a more scientific pursuit. Now, man has come to a time where they can visit the stars and planets. The author does not make Venus sound like a worthy pursuit, because the author is basing the article on the assmption that people should visit Venus.  The author gives three reasons for visiting Venus, and that is Venus is sometimes "our nearest option for planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel". Exploring Venus would help us learn more about the planet (paragraph 8) and encourage us to explore other intimidating areas (also paragraph 8). However, the last two reasons are tagged on at the very end, with little elaboration or mention in the essay. Furthermore the second reasoning is vague reasoning. The author should have used specific reasons instead of the umbrella phrase, such as learning why Venus has changed so much since their theoretical ocean covered past. Some of these can be inferred, but it's better to assume the reader knows nothing than expect them to know everything.  The other problem with this argument is the assumption that people would make a planetary visit. Save for the feel of adventure (and that would likely not make a profit based on the billions poured into these endeavors), the other reason a person would visit another planet is if they made their own planet inhospitable. It would be preferable if the government used some of the money given to NASA on projects relating to the Earth. For example, they could spend money on more efficient, sanitary, moral, and less pollutive techniques concerning meat production. They could spend some of the money on making cheap, biodegradable containers and utensils. They could use the money to subsidize fruit costs (they already do so for meat).  It would be nice if the government invested more money in figuring out how to get rid of the ring of trash around our atmosphere (from various space missions) before launching anything else.  The author does not make Venus sound like a worthy pursuit, because the author is basing the article on the single assumption that people should visit Venus. Though it is understandable that many would find fascination with expoloring beyond he outer realms of what is known, I don't think so much money should be poured into these endeavors. Much of Earth's polluting can be remedied, if the government put more money and effort into this. 		0
With the advancement of technology, students can now break the bounds of the traditional classroom and pursue education in their house while wearing their pajamas. This new opportunity for learning has led schools to question the benefits of an online learning environment. Although one can argue that online classes benefit students with physical disabilities, learning in a virtual classroom ultimately negatively affects the students' educations, for they do not learn soft skills and are more prone to distractions at home.  One can argue that online classes benefit those who have difficulty walking or traveling to school. At Generic_School, there are numerous students who utilize a wheelchair. These students must ride a special bus to travel to and from school everyday. That is an inconvenience for the student as the process of mounting the wheelchair onto the bus is cumbersome and takes a relatively long time. Furthermore, traveling between classes can be embarrassing for the disabled student as operating a wheelchair within the school hallways gathers a significant amount of unwanted attention. However, online classrooms provide a solution for those inconveniences. Virtual learning opportunities make learning more accessible for disabled students as they no longer have to leave the comfort of their home.  However, online classes do not teach students valuable social and soft skill that they could have learned in a live classroom. In school, students not only focus on academics, but they engage in group activities that enhance their teamwork, communication, leadership, and various other soft skills. For instance, live classes at Generic_School often assign students to present a topic in front of a real audience. This practice develops the students' public speaking skills which prepare them for bigger audiences and presentations in their future career. However, an online classroom does not provide that opportunity. Students often work alone; they do not engage in group activities which boost their social skills. Therefore, although students can still develop their academic skills, their social and soft skills will not progress.  Furthermore, students often perform worse when working at home on an online course because there are more available forms of entertainment at home to distract those students. At home, one can watch television, browse the internet on their phone, have snacks, take a nap, or play video games. However, the teachers and administration strictly limit most forms of distraction, in school, to¬†enhance¬†the students' education. Students who participate in online classrooms find themselves a victim of those distractions. However, students at Generic_School and other Generic_City public schools have reported to be more productive in a live classroom environment. Therefore, an online learning environment ultimately inhibits the students' progress and education.  An online learning environment has few benefits such as eliminating the need for the transportation of students who employ wheel chairs; however, online classrooms are inappropriate for students' education as they facilitate numerous distracting activities and do not provide students with the opportunity to develop crucial soft skills such as teamwork and leadership. Nonetheless, technology provides a valuable tool for students to supplement their learning in school. However, it can not replace the age old tradition of going to a physical, social, and engaging classroom.		0
 The Art of Collaboration: Why Working in Groups is the Best Way to Succeed  The age-old question of whether it's better to work alone or in a group has been debated for centuries. While some people may argue that working alone allows for greater focus and control, the majority of individuals and experts agree that collaborating with others is the most effective way to achieve success. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of working in groups and why it is the best way to achieve your goals.  One of the primary advantages of working in a group is the ability to access diverse perspectives and ideas. When working alone, it can be easy to become stuck in your own thought process and miss out on new and innovative solutions. However, when working in a group, you have the opportunity to share ideas and receive feedback from others. This exchange of ideas can lead to the development of new and creative solutions to problems that may have seemed insurmountable when working alone.  Another benefit of working in a group is the ability to learn from and with others. When working with individuals from different backgrounds and with different skill sets, you have the opportunity to learn new skills and gain valuable insights into different ways of thinking. This exposure to diverse perspectives can help you develop a more well-rounded understanding of the world and can lead to greater personal growth.  In addition to the intellectual benefits of working in a group, there are also social benefits. Working in a group can provide a sense of community and support, which can be particularly valuable in times of stress or challenge. When working with others, you can share experiences, provide emotional support, and learn from one another's successes and failures. These social connections can help to build stronger relationships and can lead to greater job satisfaction.  Finally, working in a group can be more efficient than working alone. When multiple individuals are working together on a project or task, they can complete the work more quickly than if they were working alone. This increased productivity can be particularly valuable in fast-paced work environments where deadlines are tight.  In conclusion, working in a group is the best way to achieve success in both your personal and professional life. By accessing diverse perspectives and ideas, learning from and with others, building social connections, and increasing productivity, you can achieve greater personal growth and success. So the next time you're faced		1
The Challenge of Exploring Venus  In this story the author is talking about Venus. Alot of people could care less about the planets but its a big part of the world today. In this story its talking about Venus and everything people need too know about it. I think the author in this passage described Venus well. He/she explained everything about Venus, The size, were its located, how hot it is etc. I think this cause in passage 1,2,3 it gives alot of information on Venus. And the author organized the facts really well by putting alot of facts in each paragraph and focusing on that and giving alot of information on that subject. In paragraph 4 it talks about how Venus is almost like the earth and how maybe one day they would like too visit. This is a huge thing cause if so we could have another planet of life. So in conclusion i think this article was very well planned and had just the right amount of infomation for a average person too learn and know about.  		0
Studying Venus Remains a Worthy Pursuit  The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" makes a compelling case that studying Venus is a worthy scientific endeavor, despite the extreme dangers its surface presents. In the introduction, the author acknowledges Venus's hostile conditions of near-900 degree temperatures and carbon dioxide atmosphere90 times thicker than Earth's. However, the evidence provided shows this risk is outweighed by Venus's potential to help scientists understand more about Earth and the evolution of atmospheres.   Specific details from the article support this claim. The author notes Venus is similar in size and composition to Earth yet developed vastly differently, making it a prime target to learn why atmospheric evolution diverged. Studying Venus could give insight into how a runaway greenhouse effect occurs. Furthermore, Venus's gravity and atmospheric pressure resemble those expected on the surfaces of some exoplanets discovered. Understanding Venus better may help predict conditions on Earth-sized planets in other star systems.  While Venus poses obvious hazards, the article shows its study can significantly advance scientific fields like climate science and astrobiology. Learning why two nearly identical planets ended up with such contrasting climates may help earthlings identify factors to consider regarding our own atmosphere. With careful planning and technology, exploring Venus remains quite feasible as well. In conclusion, the author presents a compelling case that the scientific payoff of Venus exploration is worth undertaking safely and can expand our knowledge in many areas, making it a worthy scientific pursuit despite present dangers.		1
You really think that the Face was created by aliens? Well I do not think that. First of all there is no evidence that aliens even exsist. Second of all, there is no evidence that it was created by aliens at all, it is just a conspiracy therory. Also another example would be that it says in the paragraph that is just a landform. I believe that the Face is just a landform, like the ones on earth.  My first example that the Face wasn't created my aliens would be, there is no evidence that aliens even exsisted ever. There is no evidence in the passage but it is just a known belief that aliens have never existed at all, in the history of ever.  Another example that i believe would be that, yet again there is no evidence that the aliens (that don't exsist) even made that. For instance, in paragraph six it states," Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact....."We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it." This example shows that even few scientist believe that the aliens created it. NASA still tried to prove that it wasn't made by the aliens that don't exsist.  My last reason I believe that the Face wasn't made by aliens would be that, the Face was proven to be just like the landforms on Earth, and we didn't shape those. For example, in paragraph twelve it states," What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. "It reminds me most of MIddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"  says Garvin. "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."  This example shows that it was proven that the Face is just like landforms on Earth.  In conclusion, these three examples show why I believe that the Face was not made by aliens. It is just a landform, like the ones on Earth. There is no evidence that aliens even exist. There is no evidence that aliens created the Face. Also it was proven that the Face is just like landforms on Earth. I believe that the Face is just a natural landform. 		0
Fellow citizens pollution is the big buzz these days, ecofriendly supplies are increasing, people want quite, cars are being created to be electrical, no polluting gases, solar power electricity! Ever since we were younger people drove attention to limiting car use in any possible way; like carpooling, riding the bus, riding bikes, or walking etc.. So what is this craze about limiting car usage?  In Vauban Germany, you can say there is no life in the fast lane, it is all life is peaceful. As a result 70 pecent of families in Vauban do not own cars; as Heidrun Walters says "When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way." As Walters walks Verdant streets there were swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drowning out the occasional distant motor.  In Paris, there's not much peace or life in the fast lane, its city congestion!  After pollution measures reached a record high, Paris banned driving to clear the smog. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. On a Monday motorists with even-numbered liscence plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 dollar fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. The smog eventually cleared enough to release the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.  While in America after 2005 with the number of miles driven peaked, thereafter, that number steadily dropped. So does this mean America's love affair with its vehicles seem to be cooling? Probably not, but as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak, equal to where the country was in 1995. The explanation is greatly because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars. Now because America's recovery of recession and unemployment, we'll be noticing in the next few years ahead.  Therefore, limiting car usage can either be an accident, emergency, placeage, celibration, or choice. Either way limiting car use is great for our environment and great for your skin!       ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    		0
The reason I think you guys/girls should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program is because you would have lots of fun and see lots of animals. Also, you can ride horses and catch cattle running away.  Also you may be able to meet new friends and see your friends there as well. And, your guys/girls could sleep with your best friends in the same cabin in bunkbeds. you can also make your own breakfast.  Some people may help you with other things like cleaning, working, and catching animals if you are just starting out. Also if you live in America you can take a boat there. You may see some of your relitives and kids you might make new friends.  Did you know that when you go there you can...... play with the animals and sleep in the barn that they have and train with Cowboy stuff. And you will get as messy as a pig in mud when you go there.  So I am going to start to rap things up and going to say ''Come on down to Seagoing Cowboys Program.'' So this is my last thing that I am going to say this goodbye and come on down now i have to go have some fun. BYE!!!		0
Online Schooling, Good or Bad?  Going to school is rough. Getting up every day to to the same boring tasks. The never ending drone of teachers voices. Going through all the drama of having to deal with your peers. However, students are much better off than when they go to school like normal, than remaining at home and doing online school. If students were to stay home for school, they wouldn't be¬†able to get the same one-on-one help that a real classroom could provide, they would have less social skills to use in the real world, and many students don't have internet or phone access to be able to attend online classes.  Firstly, if a student was having trouble understanding a subject, he would not be able to get the same level of help available¬†to him if an instructor was sitting next to them. Some students need one-on-one help to get through difficult subjects and would feel bad about getting bad grades on a subject they were not doing well in. Teachers would have a lot less control over students in this regard. They could not be sure if a student was cheating on an assignment and have a even harder time proving it. They would also have a harder time grading students work based on the fact that they can't see the students doing the work. Because of this students would not be getting the full extent of education that they deserve.  Which leads me to my second point. Students would not be getting the same kind of social interaction with online schooling, that they get when they go to school every day, which they need in their adult lives. Human beings are social creatures and need practice interacting with peers and superiors to be able to make friends and get ready for jobs in the future. Social interaction is one of the most important skills a student can obtain. Students would lack this part of their lives if they mostly talked over the internet and not face to face with people.  This brings me to my Final¬†point, online schooling is impossible if there is no internet of phone service for students to have access to. Depending on where they live, especially in more rural areas, some students and families may not get internet service or do not make enough money to afford it. The same ideas¬†apply¬†with phone service. If students only have access to a land-line they would not be able to attend these classes or would not be able to see the material that is needed for understanding. If a family did have internet access, some parents may deem it important for someone to stay at home and supervise the student to make sure they are doing the work they are supposed to be doing. Therefore losing money that could pay for the child's personal or school needs.  There are others that believe that online schooling would be very beneficial. Being at home can make some students feel a lot more secure and would promote a stronger learning environment. Some argue that if a student is disabled in some way, online schooling would be better off at home, where they could be cared for. There is also an argument for the fact that diseases spread very easily in schools, and if the student were home there would be a lot less sickness to deal with. However, the cons outweigh the pros of this type of schooling and these arguments are Inconsequential in the long run.  In conclusion, while online schooling seems nice on the surface, the trouble and problems that it would bring, such as not being able to get the right amount of help, not being having social skills to use in the future and the fact that not all students have the ability to attend online classes, makes this type of schooling impractical. There is also the fact that students would be able to cheat on assignments¬†with a lot¬†more ease, and that parents would be losing money if they had to stay home and supervise the student while the classes were being taken. For the moment, normal public school is the best option for students of this generation of students. If we were to revisit the topic in another couple of years, when the technology is better and there was a way for students to learn better social interaction, it may be viable way to teach. Let us try to make public schools better, safer, learning environments for the students of our generation, instead of trying to make a whole new system work.		0
The time off of school during summer break is always looked forward to by students and teachers, but it doesn't mean the school work stops. Summer projects are a way to ensure that students can continue to learn information over the break, but many students would not want to complete them. Although teacher-designed projects would be beneficial for learning in more detail, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows for the students to be more creative, have more freedom, and be more engaged in their project. Student-designed projects allow for students to feel like the project is less of a requirement, and rather more of an enjoyable activity.  Creativity is exactly what students need in order to complete projects in a more effective way. When students design their own project, they let their minds flow freely. This allows for the creation of projects that the students actually are interested in, which helps them become more engaged about whatever the project was about. It is a common belief that teachers should design projects so they can get their students to learn exactly what they need to, and that a student-designed project is not sufficient enough because students will not learn what they need to. However, a project by students allows them to learn content even better because they are choosing what they want to create, not being assigned it, and this creation allows them to explore content in a way that a teacher can't provide. For example, if a student had to create an instrument for music class from scratch, they would be a lot more interested in that than just making a variation of a particular instrument again. The creativity in designing a project is what students need to learn content in a way that is interesting to them, which helps them learn better during a time period where they don't even want to be doing work.  When a student designs their own project, there are very few restrictions applied. This is good because the students can learn required content however they want to, and they will most often choose to learn it in a way that is effective for them, which a teacher can't always provide. There is the argument that teachers can just give students a variety of options to choose from with a project, and that that freedom in choice will help students learn in a way beneficial to them but unfortunately that just isn't the case. Many students never get to create a project that they actually want to make, and teachers often just repeat options over and over again that students are already familiar with. For example, what if a teacher just kept giving out the same current events question, and a student never got to answer the question they were actually interested in? The freedom in designing a project allows a student to actually want to learn content, since they choose a way to learn content that would be fun to them. A student-designed project over summer would allow students to freely choose how they want to learn, which is exactly what is needed since many students do not feel motivated to work on school over summer.  Many students who complete projects throughout their school careers are not engaged in their work, and are just focused on getting a project done by the deadline with all the requirements. A student-designed project would allow students to feel more engaged in their work and not just worry about when it's due, but rather what they are learning throughout the process. Many people think that teachers can fix this problem by allowing students to choose what is required in the project, for example requiring students to pick 15 vocabulary words out of 30 to include in a newspaper project. This just isn't the same as letting a student pick out what they design though, as students would actually feel motivated to create a good project since it is something they want to complete. Students would feel more engaged in their project and feel like it was less forced if they had the ability to design it themselves.  Required summer projects by some schools would be most beneficial if they were student-designed, because it would allow for students to be more creative, feel more freedom, and be more engaged in the overall process of learning through a project. This is especially important for summer projects because many students in the summer do not want to do any school work, so a teacher assigning a student another forced project would not motivate them to complete it, while if the student got to design it themselves, they would be more interested and likely create a better project while learning more. Teachers do have the ability to design a project that students would enjoy, but the student-designed project truly allows for more learning by the students because it is more entertaining and an overall better experience.		0
 The issue of car-free cities has gained significant traction in recent years, as environmentalists and urban planners call for a reduction in car usage to improve the quality of life for city-dwellers. Some individuals might argue that cars are necessary for modern society, but car-free cities hold several advantages that are worth our attention. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of limiting car usage, focusing on the environmental, health, and social implications of car-free cities.  Firstly, car-free cities have a significant environmental advantage. Cars are the primary source of air pollution in urban areas, and they contribute significantly to climate change. According to a recent study by the University of California, cars emit 31 million tons of harmful pollutants into the air every year, leading to respiratory disorders, lung cancer, and heart disease in millions of people. By limiting car usage, we can drastically reduce these harmful emissions, leading to cleaner air and a healthier planet.  In addition, car-free cities can improve the health and well-being of city-dwellers. Many people in urban areas suffer from air pollution-related health problems, such as allergies, asthma, and respiratory issues. Walking and cycling instead of driving can reduce exposure to harmful pollutants, leading to improved health outcomes. Furthermore, car-free cities encourage physical activity, which can reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Studies have shown that cities with high rates of walking and cycling have lower rates of these chronic diseases compared to cities with high rates of car usage.  Finally, car-free cities can have a positive social impact. When we reduce our reliance on cars, we can create more vibrant and pedestrian-friendly public spaces. Streets can be designed for people rather than cars, promoting social interaction and fostering a sense of community. Car-free cities also reduce traffic congestion and noise pollution, which can contribute to more peaceful and enjoyable city life.  While some individuals might argue that car-free cities are just an unattainable dream, there are several cities around the world that have successfully implemented car-free policies. Copenhagen, Denmark, is a prime example of a car-friendly city that prioritizes cycling and walking infrastructure. The city has a comprehensive bike-sharing system, bike-friendly roads, and bike parking facilities, making it one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world. As a result, Copenhagen has a high percentage of cyclists, which has led to a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable city.  In conclusion, car-free cities hold several advantages that are worth our attention. Limiting car usage can reduce harmful air pollution, improve health outcomes, and create more vibrant public spaces. While car ownership will always have a place in society, we must recognize the importance of prioritizing alternative modes of transportation. By implementing car-free policies, we can create a more sustainable and livable future for our cities.		1
should we have less car usage in the U.S.? The answer is yes because it could stop alot of the pollution going into the atmosphere. This could help with the green house gases going into the ozone layer and harming the earth.  One reason that we should cut back on car use is because of the green house gases going into the air. In Europe passenger cars are why 12% of green house gases arer from there. But the U.S. is even more responsible for the woping 50% in somer areas here. So if you were to cut back here that would be a good thing so you can cut back on the pollution. I bet if you were to use bikes instead of cars it would cut back on the 50% of green house gases here. For example take a look at NewYorks bike-sharing program helped out the mobile world so think about it.  Another reason is a lot of people really like the fact that not having cars is a great factor to the earth. Just take a look in Germany in the town of VAUBAN residents of this town went from being minivan driving soccer moms to people who feel at ease because thw willingly gave up there cars. Which a lot of people cannot do just like that. 70% of the families in Vauban do not own cars and about 57% sold there cars just to move there which means that they all willfuly gave up there automobiles just to stay in that town and that has cut back on a lot of pollution in Europe. In the passage a women says "when i had a car i was always tense. I am much more happier this way."  so in conclusion, i belive that giving up your car to cut back on pollution just like they did in Europe is a great idea because quite frankly. I think we would be in a whole better situation if we did. This would mean a lot of the green house gases in the ozone now would not get added onto. so to me bike are a perfect way of doing this or even walking is a good substitution. So after i've explained everything are you in or out?¬† ¬†     ¬†    		0
i am all against driverless cars because there are many problems with this and there always will be, but for example cars will be more like trains. Yeah the cars will use half as much fuel as todays taxis, but I mean how would you drive to a secrect camping spot or something and there wouldnt be any more movies where a car crashes into a wearhouse because the car brakes as soon as it senses the wearhouse, and how would you out run the cops or some maniac in a car chase? you wouldnt. Our knowlegde on how to drive will change and there will be a generation that doesnt know how to drive manually for example it the article it says that and it would be pretty sad. The best way i can put it is it would be sad that it would be like we are losing or free will or our right to drive how we want. 		0
Phones and Driving  Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons. Several researchers have proved that using cell phones during driving makes driver more exposed to fatal accidents. Focus of the driver is not on the road or traffic and it becomes difficult to handle phone and vehicle at one time. Cell phones during driving also reduce the mental capacity of drivers as they fail to concentrate on minor or major activities happening around them. As already discussed, cell phones distract drivers' attention resulting in comparatively slow response to traffic signals and other related traffic events. Studies have shown the fact that breaking reaction time is also slower while talking on a cell phone during driving. The perception, vision, general awareness, and concentration of the driver are impacted while communicating on a cell phone during driving. Especially during bad weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation pay less attention to these areas increasing risks of fatal accidents. Although, there are grave negative impacts of using cell phones during driving it is pertinent, for the sake of arguments, to present benefits also. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is again the security factor.  During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route. Furthermore, using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic   		0
Phones & Driving  Phone use while driving is a very bad habit for a lot of drivers. Being on your phone while driving is how most teens get in car wrecks. Cell phones have took over most of these teens lifes. You know it's crazy when a person is willing to risk their life to text somebody back or get on social media. People die everyday in car accidents just because they was on their cell phone while driving. We are all attached to our cell phones it doesn't make no sense. A lot of teens are very guilty of using a cell phone while driving. 94% of teens know that it's dangerous but 34% of them still do it anyways. Studies say that approximately 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their phone while driving. Texting while driving has lead up to 1.6 million crashes in a year. 1 out of 4 car crashes are caused by texting while driving. Most teens will probably own up to phones while driving. The thing about it is that teens are not the only ones texting while driving. There area lot of adults who do it also. When you are talking on a cell phone it is worse than talking to your passenger. Everytime the driver gets a message or a notification they feel as if they also have to look and respond back to it. I feel as if using a cellphone while driving should be banned and against the law. Everytime you take a look at your phone you are putting not only your life but everybody in the car with you in danger. If it is an emergency i feel as if you need to pull over to the side of the road and text or call who ever it is back. Even if the device is hands free it is still dangerous cause you wont be focused on the road you will be focused on if the device is working or not. When you're talking to someone your brain is not all the way focused on the road it's putting energy in the conversation that y'all are having. It can wait until you reach your destination. Because when you text while drive you have to completely move your hands off the wheel and eyes off the road.   		0
Dear Principal,  I do not think that you should make it mandatory for students to perform community service.  Community service is great and all but some people just do not have the time to do it.  Some people need the time they spend on community service to do important things like homework or sports.  Some people need time for themselves every once in a while. I do not think you should have kids do community service.  I know from personal experience that community service takes to much time.  I have a baseball practice every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  I also have basketball practice every Tuesday and Thursday.  On the weekends I have games for both sports.  Not only that my brother has the same schedule so when and who could take me to community service.  I think it is bad idea.  Say that you barely have time for community service.  When would you have time for yourself.  I like to enjoy the little free time that I get.  Right now with all my sports and school I barely get a hour to myself each day.  If you add community service instead of that hour then I will have no free time.  Everyone needs a little free time for themselves.  I am strongly against community service.  Community service is good but it just takes to much time.  I know that not everyone at our school can do community service.  Most of my friends do sports like me and do not have the time.  I do not think you should make it mandatory for students at this school to perform community service.  From,  STUDENT_NAME      		0
Dear Florida Senator,  I can't help but notice the controversy regarding the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. While most argue that the Electoral College is a violation of freedom, I strongly believe that the Electoral College premotes equality for the candidates and the people.  By using the Electoral College system, we create an equal playing field for the candidates. For example, The Electoral College system serves as "checks-and-balances." In the words of the Office of the Federal Register in "What Is the Electoral College?": "The founding fathers established [The Electoral College] as a compromise between Congress and election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens," (Office of the Federal Register 1). This system of voting balances the voice of the people with the voice of Congress. Opposers might say that our votes don't even matter due to the fact that the popular vote doesn't directly determine our nation's President. This is far from reality, because the popular vote is vital to the Electoral College. The Office of the Federal Register writes that "most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate," (Office of the Federal Register 7). This means that the popular vote does determine - for most states anyway - whether or not the candidate recieves all of the electoral votes for that particular state.  Not only does the Electoral College ensure equality for the candidates, but for the people as well. For example, in "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong," Bradford Plumer whines about how, "At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters," going on to say that, "Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states," (Plumer 13). However, Richard A. Posner makes a fair point: "The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president...[If a candidate with only regional appeal becomes President] the residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised - to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president," (Posner 19). Moreover, Posner also writes that "Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign - to really listen to the competing candidates - knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful votes should be the ones to decide the election," (Posner 20).  Overall, the Electoral College is a symbol of our freedom of speech. I do hope you take my thoughts under consideration. The Electoral College may be called "outdated." But as the saying goes, "If it 'aint broke, don't fix it."  Sincerely,  PROPER_NAME   		0
Cars have been an important part of transportation in society for many years. However, in some communities that is changing. Many young people are not getting their licenses and some are giving up their cars. The streets of Vauban, Germany, are mainly "car-free" and the suburb only has two places to park cars, at the expense of $40,000. Limiting car usage results in many advantages.  One of those advantages is helping the environment. The article "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer explains Paris, France, put a driving ban into effect because of smog rivaling that of Beijing, China. The ban was based on license plate number, only allowing certain numbers to drive on specific days. Eventually the ban was lifited because the smog had cleared enough. Limiting the number of people that used their cars resulted in cleaner air, which is healthier for everyone. If limits were put into effect into other places, that could reduce air pollution, helping the environment. Americans are also buying fewer cars and driving less than previous years. The article "The End of Car Culture" by Elisabeth Rosenthal says, "If the pattern persists - and many sociologists believe it will - it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the envrionment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants". That is another example of environmental benefits from limiting car use. By utilizing other forms of transportation, the impact a person has on the environment is greatly reduced.  Another advantage that comes from limiting car use is lower stress and better mental health. In the suburb of Vauban, Germany, fifty-seven percent of families sold their cars to move there and seventy percent do not own cars. In the article "In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Heidrun Walter says, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way". By not owning a car, a person has less stress and can relax when traveling. There is probably less focus needed when traveling without a car because there is no worry about other drivers. Bogota, Colombia has started the Day Without Cars, the goal being to promote alternate transportation. Violaters recieve fines of twenty-five dollars. In the article "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" by Andrew Selsky, Carlos Arturo Plaza says, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution". People could enjoy the outdoors, without the constant noise and pollution from traffic in the city. That could lower their stress and increase their happiness.  Limiting car use has many advantages, some of which are helping the environment and lowering stress. Some suburbs, specifically Vauban, Germany, are mostly "car-free". A trend of buying fewer cars and driving less is also growing in America, which is beneficial to the environment. Plus, the stress of driving a car is taken away when their use is limited.    		0
  Dear State Senator,   I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I firmly believe that it is still the best method for choosing our president.  Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that the president is elected by a broad coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones. This is particularly important in a diverse country like the United States, where different regions have different priorities and values. Without the Electoral College, a candidate could simply focus on the largest states and ignore the smaller ones, leading to a president who does not truly represent the country as a whole. In contrast, the Electoral College system requires a candidate to have a broad appeal across different regions and demographics, making them more accountable to a wider range of citizens.  Secondly, the Electoral College prevents a candidate from winning the presidency without receiving the majority of the popular vote. This is an important safeguard against candidates who might otherwise attempt to exploit divisive tactics to gain an advantage. By requiring a candidate to receive a majority of the electoral votes, the Electoral College ensures that the presidency is awarded to the candidate who has the most broad-based support across the country.  Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign extensively in all states, rather than just focusing on a few highly populous ones. This is beneficial because it ensures that all citizens have an opportunity to hear from the candidates and feel invested in the election process. Without the Electoral College, candidates might neglect smaller states and concentrate solely on those with the largest populations, leading to a lack of diversity in the campaign's messaging and tactics.  Fourthly, advoc		1
 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a system used to describe the movements of facial muscles and their coding in terms of different expressions. It was developed by Paul Ekman, a psychologist, and Wallace V. Friesen, a computer scientist, in the 1970s. The system is based on the idea that facial expressions are not simply a reflection of emotions, but rather a result of muscle movements that can be objectively coded and analyzed.  The FACS system divides the face into seven regions, including the forehead, eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, cheeks, and chin. Each of these regions has a specific group of muscles that control its movement. The system describes the movements of these muscles through a set of action units (AU), which are defined as specific facial movements that can be reliably distinguished from one another. Currently, there are 42 AU that have been identified.  One of the applications of FACS is in the field of lie detection. By analyzing the movements of facial muscles during a lie or truthful statement, researchers have been able to differentiate between the two with a high degree of accuracy. False statements are often associated with specific patterns of muscle activation that correspond to particular AU, which can be used to identify falsehoods.  FACS has also been used in the analysis of emotions and affective processing. By coding the movements of facial muscles during different emotions, researchers can identify the specific AU that are associated with each emotion. This information can be used to develop more accurate models of the relationship between emotions and facial expressions.  In addition to its application in research, FACS has also been used in clinical settings. By identifying specific patterns of muscle activation associated with certain conditions, such as depression or anxiety, FACS can be used to develop more personalized treatments for these disorders. For example, therapy that targets specific muscle groups associated with anxiety may be more effective than traditional therapy that focuses on talk-based interventions.  Overall, FACS is a powerful tool for analyzing facial expressions and their underlying muscle movements. Its ability to accurately code and analyze facial expressions has led to numerous applications in research, and it has the potential to be used in clinical settings to develop more effective treatments for a range of disorders. By understanding the relationship between facial expressions and muscle movements, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the human experience and develop more accurate models of emotion and affective processing.		1
 Dear [State Senator],  As an engaged citizen of our great nation, I strongly urge you to vote in favor of keeping the Electoral College system for the election of the President of the United States. This crucial system, which has been in place since the founding of our country, ensures that the voices of all citizens are heard and that the president is elected by the people as a whole, not just by a small group of voters in a few major cities.  One of the biggest advantages of the Electoral College is that it provides certainty in the outcome of the election. While the popular vote can be volatile and subject to change, the Electoral College ensures that a candidate must receive a majority of electoral votes to win the presidency. This means that the winner of the election is truly representative of the majority of the country and not just a fluke of a particularly strong campaign in a few key states.  Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign across the entire country, not just in a few swing states. This is because each state is allocated a number of electoral votes based on its population, meaning that even smaller states can have a significant impact on the outcome of the election. By campaigning across the entire country, candidates are forced to listen to and address the concerns of citizens in all regions, rather than just those in a few key states.  Another advantage of the Electoral College system is that it allows for the president to be elected by the people as a whole, rather than just by a small group of voters in major cities. This is particularly important because the majority of Americans live in rural areas and small towns, which often have different priorities and values than those found in major cities. By allowing all citizens to have a say in the election, the Electoral College ensures that the president is truly representative of the country as a whole.  Of course, some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and no longer reflects the will of the people. However, as we have seen in recent elections, the Electoral College has proven to be a reliable and fair system for selecting the president. In fact, the Electoral College has only been thrown into turmoil once in American history, in the 2000 election between Al Gore and George W. Bush. This was an anomaly and not the norm, as the popular vote and the Electoral College vote have generally aligned in the past.  In conclusion, I strongly urge you to vote in favor of keeping the Electoral College system for the election of the President of the United States. This crucial system provides certainty in the outcome of the election, encourages candidates to campaign across the entire country, and allows for the president to be elected by the people as a whole. The Electoral College has proven to be a reliable and fair system for selecting		1
 Working in partnerships can be incredibly beneficial for learning and growth. By collaborating with others, we can share ideas and gain new perspectives that can help us to develop our skills and knowledge.  One of the key benefits of working in partnerships is the ability to learn from one another. When we work with others, we can share our own ideas and learn from the ideas of others. This can help us to develop our own thinking and improve our understanding of the subject matter.  In addition to learning from one another, working in partnerships can also help us to develop our communication skills. By discussing ideas with our partners, we can learn to express our thoughts clearly and effectively, and we can also learn to listen actively to the ideas of others.  Another benefit of working in partnerships is the opportunity to work on projects together. By collaborating on projects, we can pool our strengths and work together to achieve a common goal. This can help us to develop our teamwork skills and learn to work effectively with others.  In conclusion, working in partnerships can be a valuable way to learn and grow. By sharing ideas, developing our communication skills, and working on projects together, we can improve our understanding of the subject matter and develop our skills as a team.		1
Dear Editor,  American culture's foundation is on sports. America plays in football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and many others. So to say that students that are not qualified to play sports because of their grade average is low is not like the American way. As a student of this school, I would like to say that if most students have a grade C average, then what is the reason for having sports at all? Most students that have a grade C or lower are actually better at sports than students that have a grade B or higher. If only students that have a grade B or higher can participate in sports, there will be fewer students in the sport's team. Other schools will then have an advantage over our school when we verse against them.  The students that have grades C and lower are usually the ones that are big and exercise outside a lot. The ones that usually have a grade B or above are usually the ones studying inside. So if the new rule in school that says that only students with a grade average of B or higher may participate in school sports, would that not jeopardise the students will to play sports? If only students that have a grade B or higher can participate in sports, there will be fewer students in the sport's team. Other schools will then have an advantage over our school when we verse against them. As a student with an average grade of A' s, I would like to say let the students who want to play sports play and let the students who do not want to play sports play.  If the rule says that only above average students can play sports, but over half of the school's population is average or under average in grades, then would that not mean that the sports' coaches would have to pick basically everyone who participates? I believe that it does because especially in football, they need many players.  If students who have no experience in sports, but try out and make it, this can jeopardises the school records in their sports because they'll lose every game. Because of this the school might as well not even participate in sports.  I believe strongly that this rule should not go in this schools book because then the whole system will be a mess, even though it already is. As a student of this school, and also one who enjoys sports, .The students who have an average grade or lower should be allowed to participate in sport activities in school because they have the rights to do so.      		0
in making mona lisa smile they talked about making a facial action witch can i tell if you are happy, sad, bored, confused, and sad. if you are happy they will play adds that are like the one u smilled about if your sad they wont play ones like that and ill change that add. they also are going to be in school computers so it can tell if your cnfused or bore becuse if your bored they will try makinging it better and if your confused it will help you out more. i know peple might think its wired and a bad idia but i think it would be a grate idia becuse it could help kids get there work done more and help them understand it better. if your at your house and your depressed or sad the computer could see it and show a vido of somethinf that would mae u happy. i could also tell u what percent u are like 70 percent happy 30 percent happy. Dr huang perdicts "then it could mdifly the lesson like aneffective human communcation".  		0
Seeking opinions from multiple people when faced with an important choice or decision can help one gather a more well-rounded perspective on the issue at hand. Getting advice from only one person runs the risk of that advice being biased or limited in scope. However, by consulting several trusted individuals, you gain access to different life experiences, values, and ways of thinking about the problem.   Each person you talk to is likely to provide a unique angle or piece of insight that others may overlook. For example, if trying to decide between two job offers, discussing the options with a friend, parent, and mentor allows you to consider not just factors like salary and commute but also long-term career growth, work-life balance, and lifestyle fit. Privately, any one adviser could emphasize things most salient to their own priorities, but together their collective wisdom presents a fuller picture.  Seeking multiple opinions also lets you validate advice. If most people suggest the same path after hearing all sides, you can feel more confident you're not missing something pivotal others see clearly. Conversely, if viewpoints differ significantly, it may reveal the choice requires deeper personal reflection on your own goals and tolerance for risk. Views that initially seemed flawed may also gain nuance once counterbalanced by alternate takes. Ultimately, cross-comparing counsel empowers you to make the decision yourself in light of varied expert standpoints rather than feeling obliged to a single person's potentially limited counsel.   In tough choices, the security of consensus and the insight of diverse input better arm us to choose well. While any selection involves uncertainty, soliciting multiple opinions from trusted sources provides more data and prevents an isolated perspective from overly swaying the biggest of calls. Given life's complexity, the wisdom of crowds quite literally applies to gaining the clearest view on big questions.		1
Do you ever feel like you should join a Seagoing Cowboys program? You should join the program because it helps the world, saves people and animals, and it good if you do join. That is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program and that you are helping many peoples lives and saving people to not run away and fight back.  First, it helps the world by in 1945 World War II, was being taken over by Europe and Europe made so many countries leave the ruins and it was just not right for people to move out of their countries. So 44 nations formed a group called the," UNRRA which meant (the United Nations Relief and Rehailitation Adminstration.) So I think it would help if more people joined and you could beat the Europe people who wanted to fight.  Then, save the people and animals by UNRRA had hired the "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the young cows, horses, and mules that had been shiped overseas. That is when Luke and Don had signed up. So after they had signed up in August 1945, they had got a orders to report to New Orleans. When Luke and Don arrived on August 14 Luke had said," The day the Pacific war ended." Everyone got their seaman's papers and boarded that had SS Charles W. Wooster, headed to Greece with a cargo of horses and enough hay to eat So I think that if more people sign up more animals and people will be saved.  Last, good for you to join Seagoing Cowboys program its good by saving peoples lives and animals lives and by keeping the countries save so people can be happy if you join. And that if you join you can be rewarded will a big surprise in the end of the war that is going on. So now I think that you should always think before youself and join.  In conclusion, you should always join to be happy for what you did and joining would help the Seagoing Cowboys program. So for last try to do something new and it will really pay off if you try new things.		0
Many students have decided to move away from working in a classroom to doing classes online. Classrooms bring a lot of pressure and unneeded stress to he lives students. Taking online classes is beneficial because you can take classes on your own time, have more time to do work, and you have less stress.  The biggest part of taking classes online is the student chooses when they have classes and are not told where to be by class schedules. Students can wake up as late as they want as long as they finish all of their classes before the day is over. When your classes are on your own time, you can chose when you have breaks and when yo have to be doing work. Having taken online classes before I can say that when I got to choose when to do¬†my work I found myself developing better time management skills that have helped me in my normal everyday life. Although some may say you are missing out on the importance of a classroom setting, the classroom brings a lot of tension and is not for everyone.  When you choose when you take your classes you have more time to do your work. In a normal school day I have one hour and thirty minutes to complete all of my work for one class, but when you take classes online you can go as fast or as slow as you like. In the movie minutemen one of the main characters takes online classes while all of his friends are stuck a school, and he finds himself finishing school nearly two hours earlier than those who attend the nearby high school. If he really wanted to, he could use the whole day to take his classes while those at the school have a set amount of time to complete everything they are assigned. Having more time can lead to a lot less stress on the students minds and bodies.  Stress, the one thing that no one can avoid, can be easily managed when your taking online classes. The ability to get a full nights sleep and still have the time to complete your classes and homework. Lack of sleep is one of the biggest things that lead to stress for high school students.¬†When we are up all night studying, taking notes, or doing homework, it takes a toll on our minds. When you are taking online classes you can wake up as early or as late as you please compared to normal students who may have to stay up till 1:00 AM and wake up at 7:00 AM to be ready for school. Online students find themselves happier and more relived at the end of the day than the other students who attend school and come home stressed and exhausted.  It can be said that you do not retain all the information that you learn from a online class, but when you have the motivation and determination you find yourself learning more and becoming a better student.  Taking classes online may be seen as not the normal thing to do, but most online students end up with better grades and happier lives. The mental stress and time put on students is extreme and online classes help to prevent that. Students would benefit more from taking online classes rather than being in school due to the less stress, more time to work, and the ability to choose when you take your classes.		0
F.A.C.S this is a shorted word for Facial Action Coding System this system can use a camera or webcam and look at a person and tell how they are feeling just by the expression on there face it takes there face and compares it to a neuteral face. This technology would be great in a classroom enviorment because students can get off track or get bored very easily. Students arent very intrested in math or english they can get frustrated by doing the work. F.A.C.S could help with online learning very much by looking and rendering what expressions are happening and if they are happy and it doesn't seem like they are having trouble then it wouldn't change anything. If they have a bored or confused or even angry face then it would try and help that person by maybe changing lessons or even trying to teach it in a easier way.  In the article in paragraph six Dr. Huang says "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" this means that the computer could take that emotion and flip it around by changing somthing. Most teachers are good at spotting a child who doesn't understand or who is bored but sometimes they dont pay attention and don't see they have gone off but a computer could alaways tell if they are not getting it or are bored. A computer that could tell the way you feel from just looking at you would help alot of students it is sometimes hard to tell the way we are feeling especially when you try and hide it but the computer software would pick it up. Dr. Huang also stated "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication", "So computers need to understand that, too"  Thus this technology would be a great and huge advancement because it could help out so many people maybe a student is sad and the computer picks up on it and it tells the teacher and that student could talk to someone or it could pick up on fear and tell someone about that and then they talk about that. this technology could teach the computers how to deal with so many things which is why it would be useful in the classroom.		0
The Electoral College process involves the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors the votes for VP and the President, and the couting of electoral votes by Congress. In my opinion, I think its only fair to change the election by popular vote for the presdident of the United States. I say that because its OUR president not just the 538 voters president. Also, if we go by the majority of the votes, thats not fair to the president either. what if it just so happened that they picked a lot more people who dont want him to be out president and they just took there verdict from there?  Changing the election by popular vote would be a lot more fair to the presient and to the people. I say that because, you cant tell what every body wants just by 538 votes and with the majority of 270 electoral votes. Like I said before, what if you just so happend to pick a lot more people who dislike the "new" president, but their were actually a lot more people who liked him?  To Conclude, changing te election by popular vote for the president would be a lot more fair instead of having an Electoral College vote. Popular vote will let everyone have a say in the President and not just 538 people. Its also just as fair for the President as it is to us because it gives the president more votes to count on and not just 270.    		0
I think that there were definitely alians there. I might not be able to prove it, but I do believe and will someda prove that there are aliens in space. When it comes to the Face I have a hard time proving the whole alien things. I mean like don't believe everything you read. So to me studying the Face is hard  Ok, so NASA is saying 25 years ago they noticed something funny that happened at Mars. I think the thing they spotted was aliens. Besides the red stuff the only weird on Mars would be aliens.  In my opinion, I dont think the Face was created by aliens. So far scientist haven't even see aliens in space so if that's the case how could aliens have created the Face. You know humans had to create that one.  I do think there are aliens in space but I don't think they made the Face. Until scientist find out they aliens exist I'm keep thinking that it was a really smart guy. So come on sicentist lets find out if aliens exist.  Some genius Enstein has made the Face up and blamed it on aliens. But when I grow up I'm going to do more stufy on aliens and fidn out if they really were the ones who invented the Face. But for now whoever the guy is played a really good prank.                         		0
The Electoral College is best described as outdated and obsolete. It was designed so that, when there were too many states and poor technology, the vote could be fairly and realistically counted, by voting between a few people from each state. This was good and efficient for that time, but, with the technology available to us today, it is impractical and easy to corrupt. if you live in a mostly Democratic state as a Republican, your vote is regarded as nothing, and you would have no reason to vote in the electoral college, instead of throwing your vote into the entire mass of the united states, where it has a chance to even slightly influence the vote. Also, since larger states are given more attention, due to the allornothing attitude of most states, other states are given less information and are forced to make more wild guesses than votes, a result of having less information.  When the idea of the Electoral College was introduced, the telegraph was still pretty hot technology. All votes would be counted by hand by an impartial court, counting off the vote of every single person individually, out of perhaps more than a million voters. Instead of this, each state would record their own numbers and dispatch a group of electors, who could not be influenced away from their vote, while sending a horseman or a few across the hundreds of miles of U.S. territory with a few little scraps of paper with votes on it would be impractical and dangerous. bags could be lost, a rider could have an accident, entire counties would be unaccounted for. The Electoral College was a nessecity as well as a stroke of genius, and I applaud the man who thought of it. However, this was when the telegraph was a stroke of genius, too. Now we have a cell phone the size of a notepad that can store thousands or millions of votes alone. We have processors that can count the number of people that like apples versus oranges and come out with a percentage, verdict, receipt, and the best bussines option as soon as the numbers are input, as soon as we push that little blue "Enter" button. We can send the votes through the air in the billions, without as much as wires to conduct them. there is little or no possibility of tampering or miscommunication, and there are records to back up and correct every single little error. it is much smarter, safer, and more accurate to initiate a simple counting program on the computer, with each individual terminal sending all of it's results and information to a higher terminal until all of the information is scored, backed up, double checked, counted, percentaged, and a final verdict is reached. This can even be done in a way to run the information separately to different computers, to minimize tampering. The electoral college is obsolete, a small parasite of politicians who just dont want this to end. we dont still use the telegraph, do we?  The electoral college is not only obsolete, unnesessary and parasitic, but also unfair to many voters. The main ways this unfairness can be identified are extreme, and each really deserve a paragraph of their own. Let us imagine a scenario: a democrat lives in a mostly republican state. He goes to vote. His vote is passed along, checked off, and placed aside for a time. When all of the votes are in, the republican votes outweigh the democrats. Now, our democrat's vote, his wife's vote, the democratic guy who works at 711 down the street's vote, Joe's vote, Bob's vote, Billy's vote, "That girl Suzie's" vote and ALL THE DEMOCRATIC VOTES IN THE STATE are all, essentially, thrown into the furnace, and will do so next election, the election after, and essentially every mostly republican election after that. In a popular vote without the barrier of the Electoral College, all those votes would flow into the pile for whichever canidate they voted for. Then the pile would be counted, divided into the total votes, and percentaged. then, at lest the votes could count for SOMETHING, other than a waste of time. But wait! there's more. Most states have an allornothing ideal, meaning if politician A got 51% of the votes in California, while politician B still got 49%, Politician A gets 55 votes in the Electoral College, while politician B gets squat. This does not represent the best interests of many of the people in that state. this is unfair. It also means that larger states have the advantage, because they get more votes, like California 55, Texas 38, and Florida 29, while smaller states get less, such as Alaska 3, Rhode Island 3, and Hawaii 4. Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called "swing states," where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.  In conclusion, the electoral college was the most efficient and sucessful way to vote, back in the 17001800. However, with current communication and transportation technologies, the College has become obsolete, to the point where it should be buried at a crossroads with a stake through it's heart. It is unfair, biased, impractical, and just overall worthless. We should put our newfound technology and knowledge to use and do away with the electoral College, once and for all.		0
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:  Hey there, so I'm in 8th grade and I'm trying to figure out what career I want to pursue when I grow up. It's kind of scary because there are so many options! But I know I want to do something that's going to make me happy and also make a lot of money so I can live comfortably.  I've been doing some research and I'm really interested in the medical field. I think it would be so cool to help people and make them feel better when they're sick or hurt. I've been to a few medical workshops and they were really informative. I learned about all the different types of doctors and nurses and what they do. I even got to see some surgeries and it was pretty cool!  But I'm also interested in mechanics. I love cars and I think it would be awesome to work on them and make them go faster and look cooler. I went to a mechanic workshop and I learned about all the different parts of a car and how to fix them. It was really fun and I'm definitely considering pursuing a career in mechanics.  So, I'm thinking about taking some courses in high school that will help me prepare for these careers. Like, I want to take biology and chemistry because they're important for medicine, and I want to take auto shop because it will help me learn about cars. And I know I need to get good grades in these classes so I can get into a good college and eventually get the job I want.  But I don't want to just focus on schoolwork, I want to enjoy my classes too! I think it's important to have fun and learn new things, so I'm going to try to find ways to make my classes more interesting. Maybe I'll find a hobby or activity that's related to the subject and I can use that to help me learn. Or maybe I'll just find a way to make my classes more fun, like by doing group projects or something.  Anyway, that's what I'm thinking about my future right now. I know it's a big decision and I have a		1
Should more driverless cars be made in the future, do they really help? There are positives and negatives of the driverless cars. A positive, according to the passage is "that cars have sensors that make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel." Having that sensor can keep the driver alert of the road and drivers around. Another positive would be" the seats vibrating, they are to alert the driver when the car is in danger of backing up into an object". That is important because things such as vehicles are closer then they really are in the mirrors. So when your backing up, you could be closer then you think and without the alerting of the vibrating seat, you could tap someones car, which would lead to some very exspensive bills for you or worse losing the right to drive. This all sounds great but, there are negatives too to these amazing cars, unfortunatly. Say you have and older driverless car and the sensors don't work as quickly and you hit someone from behind. You say you were paying attention or your car didn't say anything, who's fault is it really then? Is it your fault, should you be charged or let off because of a "bad" car? We all know technology is nice, fast ,and very helpful but, we also all know you can't always depend on technology. It shuts down or gets viruses, or could just die on us at the very time we need it. If you were in a car accident and you were the one that had been hit by a young driver and the young driver says "my car didn't do anything", you would want to say the young driver was probably on the phone but you don't really know. Say the driver wasn't on the phone and the car really didn't do anything to keep her from hitting you. What do you tell the police, who do I blame?  I think the positives stand out more then the negatives because they really do help. A elderly with there lisence is on the road and she/he has to slam on there breaks but just couldn't do it fast enough because there so slow and old, the "Smart Car" can help by alerting her/him quickly before she/he sees that everyone has slowed down because of an car accident up ahead that she/he can't see. Teenagers are young and dumb, they are always destracted by there phones, if there eyes are on the phone then whos watching the road? Teenagers get in horriable accidents everyday because they do silly things like texting while driving. The Smart Car can keep them focus and alert them on whats up ahead as well as what's around them. Some Smart Cars won't let you move or do anything untill you put your seat belt on, a seat belt can save you. Smart Cars can save lives.  More of these driverless cars or Smart Cars should be made. They really have brought down the number of accidents. I actually have a Smart car or a smart truck and it doesn't let us down. It will not let you turn on the radio or start the car unless everyone has on there sear belts. It says "welcome" too everytime you get in, such a nice car. Our car has cameras on all four sides of it. the most usefull one is the back camera, it shows everything behind us. We are a big family so when we go grocery shopping, it's a lot of food, sometimes we can't see out the trunk window. How would we know if a car was coming or a family was walking by? What if a dog ran pass or a child ran pass, the Smart Car quickly alerts us by blinking rapidly and making loud beeping noises, the TV in the front of the car shows us what's behind the car or whatever the cameras are showing so my Mom can quickly stop the car so whatever's passing through dosn't get hurt or we don't mess up our nice car. The Smart Car saves lives and money. I can't wait to get my own! 		0
There are always peple saying that aliens are alive and maybe that there is going to be an alien invasion. In 1976, a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) found an image of a peron or as MGS says a "a Viking photo." I believe the image of the Viking is just a landform and it wasn't created by aliens. I will explain to you why i think it's a landform.  I believe the image is a just a landform because scientists haven't discovered life yet on mars even though they have found water on Mars. In paragraph 2, the author states, "Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydnia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah." I agree with this statement because if the Martian mesa was made again, that means that they will be around for a long time and it will never disappear. The author also states that people think the image or the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. By the looks of the images, I could see that every year they have taken it, I can see that it's disappearing. In the introduction, it says, "New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is is: A mesa." If people want evidence of aliens or other creatures, they will have to do research on their spare time because scientists have a job to do and they will only do what they are ordered to do. Just to be clear, when they took the photos of the Face on 1976,1998, and 2001, the technology wasn't as advanced as it is today but, if we take a photo of it today, I believe there will probably be another one of the landfoms or probably we might see the Face but just slowly disappearing. These were some of my reasons to argue with to support my belief of the Face being a natural landform.  In conclusion, the image of the Face was just a myth and I will never say it was created by aliens. Aliens aren't even real, that hasn't benn confirmed or said. Not one scientist has said that they have seen a living creature on any planet walking or doing anything. These were just rumors and it can be said as a myth if people want. Based on these reasons, I believe the Face is just a natural landform on Mars.    		0
Summer vacation is often regarded as the most ejoyable time a student can have in year. Although many students enjoy this time, the content they learned at school can be lost in the festvities. To ensure this does not happen, schools should hand out a required summer assignment of the students' choosing. By letting the students choose, they will be more interested in the topic of the project, more inclined to further study the topic they chose beyond the requirements of the projects and said project will decrease the probability of a student forgetting the material learned during the school year.  Students are far more likely to complete an assignment to the best of their ability if they are interested in what they're doing. The usual projects assigned by teachers are often boring and can be done well enough for a good grade in around an hour of solid work. However, if the student is passionate about the project they will go above and beyond in order to inform their teachers and peers about the topic they have chosen. Students who pick their own project get to show off what they know and what they've learned which is a huge incentive in and of itself.  Students that pick their topic may get so interested in what they're doing that they dive into deeper thought about the subject, a useful learning experience that can be beneficial in all walks of life, or do more research for the joy of doing it rather than for the grade. This will enrich the students education with learning strategies and techniques not often taught at school. It will also persuade them to fall in love with the joy of learning new things and, as a result, their educational performance will drastically increase. In addition students could find a passion in what they're researching providing a goal for the student which will also increase academic performance. For example, I found what I'd like to major in at college through a project I got to choose. It also provided me with an opportunity to think outside the box, something i rarely get the chance to do at school.  Student forgetting information is an issue all schools face. The first month of school is often spent doing review which wastes time in the long run. If students did just one project over the long break, they are less likely to forget what they learned the previous year. The project would have certain guidlines that would touch on each of the core subjects, namely: science, math, language arts and history. By doing this, students will apply the skills learned in the classroom to something their interested in.  In conclusion, students who pick their projects are more likely to acquire new, useful learning skills outside of the classrom, retain the information learned at school and finally, fully apply themselves in an effort to show off their knowledge and spread their passion.¬†		0
 Dear Senator,  I am writing to express my views regarding the role of the Electoral College in determining the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the current system is functioning adequately and should be maintained or, at the very least, given some modification rather than being replaced entirely.  The Electoral College has been in place since the creation of the United States, and it has served as a vital tool in ensuring that the population of the country is fairly represented. According to the original intent of the framers of the Constitution, each state was given a certain number of electoral votes based on its population size. This ensures that even the most sparsely populated states have a voice in the election process. This system provides an incentive for candidates to campaign in all states, not just in densely populated regions.  However, there have been some changes in recent years that have threatened the integrity of the Electoral College. As the country has become more urbanized, small, rural states have been receiving fewer electoral votes than they once did. This has limited their influence in the election process and made it easier for urban states, with larger populations, to dominate. Additionally, the candidate who wins the popular vote in a state does not necessarily win all of that state's electoral votes, further skewing the outcome.  Despite these concerns, I believe that these issues can be addressed without completely abolishing the Electoral College. One potential solution is to adopt a "tiebreaker" system, where a candidate who wins the popular vote in two or more states would be awarded those states' electoral votes over the other candidate. This would help ensure that the candidate with the most broad-based support is elected President, rather than the candidate who wins narrowly in a few densely populated areas.  In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is a flawed but necessary system for determining the President of the United States. While it has its shortcomings, the system provides adequate representation for all states and encourages candidates to campaign across the country. I urge you to consider implementing a tiebreaker system to address the concerns raised by the recent changes in our political landscape while maintaining the integrity of our election system.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
Do you believe driverless cars are really safe? Even though driverless cars could be very helpful to people in some situations, I am against the development for driverless cars. Driving isn't supposed to be fun, because driving should be safe at all times. In my opinion cars are at their zenith.  First of all, driving a car isn't supposed to be fun, it's suppose to be safe. With driverless cars you have to be alert 100 percent of the time because these cars aren't comepletely driverless. These cars could cause many accidents. If the driver isn't completey alert and if an accident is ahead what is the car supposed to do? When driving, the drivers, passengers, and pedestrians are supposed to be safe. Can a car that is in control 90 percent of the time ensure that?  Secondly, cars are at the zentih of development. Most cars today have everything you need to be, "safe". Cars today have radar sensors, position- estimating sensors, a video camera mounted near the rear view mirror, a GPS receiver, and a Dubbed Lidar. All of those things promote safety when driving. The person driving doesn't have to know when to take control of the vehicle because they are already in control. What more could a car possibly need?  I am against the development of driverless cars. Cars are already developed and shouldn't need anymore done to them. They are safe enough. Driving isn't supposed to be fun. These cares could cause accidents if the driver isn't completely alert. Everyone on the road is supposed to be safe.           		0
 Summer is a time to unwind and enjoy the warm weather, time with loved ones, and a break from the stress of school or work. As a student, I believe that summer is a time to relax and recharge, and for adults, it is just as important to take a break from their daily routines and responsibilities.  During the school year, students are constantly bombarded with assignments, tests, and projects. It can be overwhelming and stressful, and I believe that summer is the perfect time to take a break from all of that. Not only does it give us a chance to catch up on sleep and rest, but it also allows us to spend time with our friends and family, which is essential for our mental and emotional well-being.  Additionally, summer is a time for students to pursue their goals and interests outside of the classroom. Whether it's getting a part-time job, volunteering, or traveling, summer provides us with the opportunity to gain new experiences and develop new skills. This can be especially beneficial for students who may not have as much support or resources as others, as it allows them to take charge of their own personal and professional development.  As an educator, I understand the importance of a break from the daily grind of teaching. Teachers work hard to prepare their students for success, and it's essential that they take the time to recharge and refresh. However, I also know that students need a break from the classroom, and a longer summer vacation could provide them with the time and space to pursue their interests and goals.  In conclusion, I believe that summer is a time to relax, recharge, and pursue personal and professional goals. Whether you're a student or an adult, taking a break from the daily routine is essential for our mental and emotional well-being. A longer summer vacation could provide students with the time and space to pursue their interests and goals, while also allowing them to take a break from the stress of school and work.		1
 The Challenge of Exploring Venus   Venera 13 landed on Venus in 1982, but its MDO (massive descent oven) did not open, so the lander was unable to take pictures of the surface. Engineers determined the oven door was stuck due to overheating during the descent through the Venus atmosphere. In the end, Venera 13 transmitted atmospheric data for about four hours until its transmitter failed.  Because of complications like this, exploring Venus has proven to be challenging for scientists. It's far more difficult to design a lander capable of withstanding Venus's surface conditions than Mars's. In particular, the planet's thick atmosphere makes it difficult for spacecraft to reach the surface. Despite the difficulties and dangers of exploring Venus, the author believes studying the planet is a worthy pursuit. This claim is supported by evidence in the article, which shows that Venus is a unique and fascinating planet with a lot to offer in the way of scientific research.  The author discusses how Venus's atmosphere is a mix of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds, making it difficult for spacecraft to survive the descent to the surface. This poisonous atmosphere is one of the challenges of exploring the planet. Despite this difficulty, the author claims that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. This claim could be strengthened by discussing the unique scientific value of Venus.   The author also describes how Venus's surface is hot and arid, with temperatures reaching 475 degrees Celsius. This harsh environment makes it difficult for spacecraft to operate on the surface. Despite this challenge, the author claims that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. This claim could be supported by discussing how Venus's extreme conditions make it a valuable environment for scientific research.  In conclusion, the author effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The article provides detailed evidence of the unique and challenging environment of Venus, making the author's claim more persuasive.		1
 Introduction:  Driverless cars are becoming increasingly popular in the market. These cars are designed to operate autonomously, without any human intervention. While they promise to be revolutionary, there are concerns about their safety, security and reliability. The debate on whether or not driverless cars are a good idea remains open-ended. In this essay, we will explore the positive and negative aspects of driverless cars, and present an argument for and against their development.   Body: Positive aspects of driverless cars: 1. Reduced safety concerns: Traditional cars are responsible for a significant portion of road accidents. Driverless cars, on the other hand, pose a lower risk of accidents, as they are controlled by advanced sensors and software that can detect and avoid obstacles. 2. Increased productivity: With driverless cars, passengers will have more time to focus on other tasks, like work or leisure, without having to worry about driving. 3. Environmental benefits: Driverless cars can be more energy efficient than traditional cars, as they can optimize their driving patterns and reduce emissions.  Negative aspects of driverless cars: 1. Job loss: The widespread adoption of driverless cars could result in the loss of jobs for drivers, transportation workers and other related professions. 2. Cost concerns: Driverless cars come with a high initial cost, as they require expensive sensors, software and hardware. 3. Security concerns: There are concerns about the security of driverless cars, as they are vulnerable to cyber attacks and hacking.  Argument for the development of driverless cars: Driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel and live. They promise to reduce safety concerns, increase productivity and have environmental benefits. While there are concerns about the initial cost and job loss, the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term costs. With proper regulations and safety protocols in place, driverless cars can be a safe and effective mode of transportation.  Argument against the development of driverless cars: While some of the benefits of driverless cars are undeniable, there are also significant concerns about their safety, security and reliability. There is a risk of cyber attacks and hacking, which could compromise the safety of passengers and other road users. Additionally, there are concerns about the impact of driverless cars on employment, particularly in the transportation sector. The initial cost of developing driverless cars is also high, and there is no guarantee that they will be lower than traditional cars in the long run.  Conclusion: In conclusion, the development of driverless cars is a complex issue with both positive and negative aspects. While they promise to be safer and more efficient, there are concerns about security, employment and cost. We need to weigh these benefits against the actual risks and ensure that safety protocols are in place before embracing driverless cars as a viable mode of transportation.		1
Have you ever wanted to be in a club but were afraid of meeting people? Did you ever think about expanding your mind in trying something different or challenging? Or, maybe, you just wanted to join ceramics or drama? Many of us, especially teens, worry about talking to new peers of ours. so we never try it. If we never attempt to go the extra mile to do something, we might miss out on the chance of meeting a life long confidant. After-school activities guide us into doing things out of our comfort zones to enjoy many unknown hobbies. These special groups provide such enjoyment and laughter to thousands of children. I agree with the decision that all students may participate in at least one extracurricular because it takes away unnecessary stress, gives new topics to learn about, and students can make new friends.  First, learners should take at least one extracurricular because it removes unneeded stress. For example, it creates an enjoyable part of school at the end of the day. As every teacher knows, students don't favor school very much and adding an exciting aspect to it will let them relieve all that built up information about tests and homework. Also, this provides a way of releasing all stress by having a specific time that contributes to doing so. When kids don't go straight home and start their homework, they feel more at ease and relaxed about their schoolwork and don't feel pressured. Furthermore, clubs let young thinkers forget about the crazy nonsense that might've occurred at school that day. Maybe students got sent to the office and are worked up about that, this assists them by going somewhere where no one judges you and keeps you as calm as possible. Therefore, removing stress is a big factor on why learners should participate in an extracurricular.  Second, these activities give new topics to learn about. For instance, many young adults might be unsure about their interests, and they could make it clear for themselves. You might believe you hate art, but when you join the school club for it, it could be your dream profession to become an artist. Everyone will be able to discover their passions at their own pace. Additionally, if a person wants to be apart of a cultural learning group, it will grow their mind to understand different races and nationalities to compare to their own. While attempting to understand a unknown area, children enrich their knowledge of the world. Moreover, teens can have an opportunity to talk and address issues that are not taught in the classroom. They might touch on World War II in History, but if they want to go into it more in depth, World War II Club will provide them with that. In summary, extracurricular gives brand new items to go deeper into, which helps in the many ways listed above.  Lastly, people can make new friends. Many professors and parents believe that pushing our kids to meet new peers is wrong and shouldn't be accepted. They say that they should gradually build up the courage to speak up. But why not head start¬†them into the path of publicly speaking to people they don't know. Many children haven't been taught how to be confident, so I believe adding these activities will add that to the curriculum. When put in these groups, students are exposed to others with unique backgrounds. They all can share their own point of views to start up collaboration, which can lead to becoming best friends forever. Another point is the freedom of seeing people outside of your classes is added. When you have a pattern of saying hi to a variety of colleagues, you make more connections that could possibly last a lifetime. Introverts also have the chance of conversing very often. They are sometimes misunderstood and handing them a way of being understood might let them open up a bit. All in all, knowing new faces and personalities could create a way of adding friends.  In conclusion, I agree with the decision that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it removes stress, it promotes the making of new friends, and gives a variety of topics to learn about. Every teenager should go out and try something they haven't. They should understand that this new rule actually benefits them in ways that they never even noticed. You need to take risks to have new experiences in your life to look back on. "New and "different" might be scary words to hear, but sometimes change and interaction is fascinating. Just take that leap of faith, and everything will work out in the end. When you join that ceramics club, all your fears of people and challenge will go away. Your mind will expand, and it could turn out to be your passion.		0
Face The Landform?  Everyone seems to believe that the face on mars was created by Aliens. They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform. But, do they actually do research like the scientists do? There are many reasons that the face on mars is just a lanform, and here are those reasons.  First off, when NASA's Vicking one spacecraft was just circling and roaming around it came across something unexpecting. By snapping a few pictures, they believed it was a face. Later, when it was revealed to the world, people believed that aliens had made that mark on mars. The texts says, that no one has past over that "face" in awhile. So how come a few pictures identify a face by using one camera? So that's when scientist decided to investigate the face on mars.  After scientists did a little research on their own, "The Face" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west. How can that be? Well, i will expect no one to believe that because for 25 years it was known as the face on mars. Scientists had to travel up to space by Mars and snap several pictures of the face. After they did their research collected thir data it came out to be a landform.  Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera. What's the difference its just a camera. Well, that camera captured the truth about mars. For proof, if you looked online you can actually see what was really there. Even NASA's spacecraft revealed it to be a messa. So, it was just a false staement. There was no alien monument, in the first place. So for 25 years the face on Mars was actually a messa. But NASA would rather hide the truth about what they saw. So until, it's revealed as an actual face, it will be known as a messa or some peopel still say it's the face of Mars.  So with that all said, the face turned out to be a messa. So with the actual data, everyone should know that it is a messa. So wa sthe face really created by aliens, no it was not. It was really a landform.            		0
Do you think if Students designed their own projects they would benefit from them? Would they even do them? How would credited? How would it enhance the students learning more efficiently than a teacher would?  Teacher designed projects are a lot more efficient to student learning because students' maturity levels may not allow them to fully take advantage of the designed projects, the teachers have the degree¬†experience to assign proper projects to enhance the students' learning, and also future consequences for a students' education is important.  Students are often not the most mature people and are big procrastinators. Students are not mature enough to do or even make projects for themselves. There would be no correct balance or challenge because all students like to find easier ways to avoid hard tasks. So having students make the designed projects over the summer would not¬†increase their learning.  Considering experience; Teachers not only have degree, but teaching and assigning a proper designed assignment for to a student to complete is what they work and get paid to do. Teachers have the mind set and the capability to help students achieve and expand their knowledge so that they are progressing. Teachers also always knows what is best for a students' learning and what they should and should not be doing.  When students are assigned an a assignment they might procrastinate but they often realize that laziness and not enhancing your learning to better yourself can affect you in the future. Their decisions can put them at a disadvantage to get into colleges. So having a teacher who designs the projects will help the students progress on their learning for the future because future consequences count. Jobs or even universities would not take a student seriously if their projects were designed by themselves. Teacher designed projects fit curriculum standards that are credible to the learning process of a student, and thats what matters.  In regards, every student should have the opportunity to learn the right way. Learning student to student is not the right way. Teachers design projects because they know students are not mature enough to do it themselves, or have the experience that they have, or even realize how important their future is. Thats why there is not only school but also tutors and extra help offered at every county to better students in their learning. As said before it's not that students aren't capable of designing their own projects but, Teachers are put into place to better the learning of students.		0
Dear, our school principle  I am writing this letter because i think we should use policy 1. I think we should use policy 1 because when we are in lunch and our parents call us it might be an emergency. Some us might just use are cell phones for texting or just for fun.  Also we should be allowed to use our phone during our free time is because sometimes we might have an embarrassing problem and we might not want to go to the office and use their phone we would rather use ours. We would rather use ours because we have more privacy and we wont feel so embarrassed.  Another reason why i think we should have policy 1 is because we can text or talk without getting in trouble and i will be very thankful. If we do get policy 1 a lot of students will be excited and might be able to talk to someone in another country. Some adults may think why cant they just call when they get home, well maybe they cant call when they get home is because that person may be 3 hours or more a head of our time. For example like Florida, New York, or any part in Europe.  I also think we should have policy 1 is because we might want to stay after school or go with our friends somewhere and that way we can let them know, but if we have policy 2 we wont be able to do that because we wont have our phone. We should also have policy 1 because if our parents forget to pick us up or need to tell us to walk they can text us or call us after school. Also if we need to call a uncle, aunt, or any family member for some reason it will be easy to contact them with our phones.  In conclusion i think we should have policy 1 because it will be easier to contact someone or just to talk or text with an old friend. Also we will be thankful for this policy and for our principle for allowing us to bring our cell phones. These were some reasons why i think we should have policy 1.  Another reason why i think we should have policy 1 is because we will have freedom to text and talk to our friends in other states or schools. This is why i think we should have policy 1 in our school. I hope you will understand this reasons why we should have policy 1 and why we will be very thankful to have this policy. Thank you for taking the time to read and understand this letter, and why i think we should have policy 1.      		0
While driverless cars present promising innovations, fully replacing human drivers could have unintended consequences.   The article outlines several potential benefits of driverless cars. Without human error, they could dramatically reduce accidents and save thousands of lives each year. Drivers would gain free time while commuting, allowing them to nap, read or work. Those with disabilities may regain mobility. At first glance, these advantages seem compelling.  However, the transition could create new problems. Many drivers enjoy operating vehicles and find it a personally fulfilling activity. Forcing them to fully relinquish control risks alienating these individuals. Autonomous systems also remain imperfect - software glitches, hacking attempts or unexpected scenarios may still lead to accidents occasionally. Complete reliance on computers for transportation could therefore feel risky to some.   Furthermore, while driverless technology allows mobility for those otherwise unable, it may also discourage certain life skills. Navigation, judgement of traffic conditions and manual driving provide learning opportunities that autonomous vehicles minimize. Over-dependence on automation risks depriving future generations of these experiences.   On balance, a cautious approach seems wisest. Gradually introducing more driver-assistance features allows their benefits to be realized while preserving options for human judgement and control. Mandating fully driverless operation prematurely could undermine individual freedom and autonomy. With more testing and improvements to address security and limitations, autonomous vehicles show promise. But a mixed system retaining significant human participation appears best initially. Overall the debate illustrates an important tension between innovation and its unintended societal impacts worth ongoing discussion.		1
In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests hat studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supprts this idea carfully by giving clear evidence in the text. He goes on to describe the likelyhood of the past on Venus, the conditions in which sutdying the planet would take place, and how studying the planet may benifit the human race.  To begin with, the author makes a valid point by starting off with an explaination of the likely hood of Venus's features being closely related to those of Earth. The author goes on to tell the reader about the crucial consideration of visiting Venus. In the artical, it clearly states that "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solr system." (Paragraph 4.) And goes on to tell, in detail, how "Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth." Giving clear examples of the likely hood that life could have very well been on Venus.  Furthurmore, the author also claims that the conditions Venus demonstrates, while studying its features and possible living conditions, could very well be possible given the right equiptment and procedure. The artical claims that Venus can, very well, be studied, and that "Many reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningful to our knowledge of Venus." (Paragraph 6.) Given this example, it seems as though the author has a very well thought out point.  In addition, the author goes on to explain how benifitial studying Venus can be for the human population, and for the sake of science and curiosity in itself. For example, in paragraph 8, the author states "Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." In other words, this tells us that we can and will gain from the planet, and possibly grow knowledge wise of the unknown mysteries on Venus.  To wrap things up, the author states clearly the facts on how dangerous studying and taking in information on Venus could truely be through-out the artical, but also gives valid points on the subject to support to his idea that "studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depite the dangers it presents." Including how it benifits, and the likely hood that the past could become a mere future depending on technology and the studys that can be found. The author makes very clear and considerable points in his argument.     		0
What do think of extracurricular activities? Usually they are programs or activities outside of work or school. In this case it's school and, not all students like doing them because they don't like to interact with others or they don't have an interest for it. Some schools require extracurricular activities and I agree because it's a chance to have new hobbies and friends.  To start, by doing extracurricular activities you can discover new hobbies. Some students are required to do extracurricular activities and have found a new hobby¬†or interest doing so. I believe it is a good thing because by having new hobbies they can also discover new career paths to go along with it. Therefore, when a student decides to get a job or when they graduate they might have some experience in that area due to the extracurricular activities. Students could also use these hobbies in their everyday life or even boost their confidence in something like SCA. However, some of these extracurricular activities are not all hobbies but, long-term thing like sports. Sports can be a good way to boost confidence and how social a student is in public, at home, and school.  Lastly, doing activities outside of school is also a great way to make friends. Activities such as sports, SCA, or any hobbies can be a good way to spark new friendships. These friends could be long or short-term but, by having friends can produce more interacting¬†with others and more participation in extracurricular activities. The only downside is, horsing around or being engaged in conversation while participating in activities. However, students who are not very social with others could make friends an have someone to support them when they need it. This could also benefit others participating because they could engage in conversation, depending on the activities, and have the opinion of that students.  Overall, by doing activities outside of school students could discover new hobbies and make new friends. Extracurricular activities are not only good for what they are meant to be but, for boosting parts of a persons personality that might be low. So, next time think of an extracurricular activity as a good way to start something new.		0
The usage of Facial Action Coding Systems will change the way learning has been viewed traditionally. Students will no longer be bored or destracted from learning. The requirements are simple, having a face and 44 major facial muscles. simple right? Anyone is able to benefit from FACS.  This software works based on its ability to detect human emotions by detecting an "action unit," which is trigered by the movement of a sertan muscle. Even you do similar things to this software, for example; you might be able to guess the emotion of someon based on their face expresion, right? This software works the same way but in a more accurate level.  This technology would benefit classrooms the most, for example; if the software detects a sad emotion ond the user when learning the software could make the lessong more intersting and making the student stay on track with others.  FACS could also alert teachers of students that could be having problems outside of school based on their emotions. This software can detect "diferent types of emotions" like happines, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnes as Dr. Eckman stated.  In conclusion this software would precent many benefits for schools and users. this would also make better and more interestign ways of learning for students.       		0
Car less? Is it harmful? Why should i give up my car? If any of these questions pop up in your head you should hear this.  Theirs many cities trying out these new policy about not using their vechicle and now results of that is there actually finding it better and knowing its saving our world gives it a better feeling. "its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" mention businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode his two-seat bicycle with his wife. Yeah its a scariface but its all worth it towards the end. Know the next generations are going to follow up on our tasks and continue to make this world a better place and end our problems we couldn't finish off. "smart planning" movement of Suburban and United States are excited about. Our air pollulation has drop and knowing it takes a huge rock off of our chest. Perhaps some people wouldn't agree so much with it, but people not following policy is soon fined and reject paying the fine the vechicle is soon towed and extra fee is charged. Cizitiens wouldn't like it much but doing what is nesscery is have to come upon to us. We have to do something about our pollution disaster we caused. Knowing our Kid's kids are going to suffer on our mistakes. risking their lifes because some of us people want to act selfish and not react to this significant matter.  The time is here, help our fellow friends and family. Everybody is part of this significant movement. No more stressing and killing our own humanuity slowly and time to revive our communities and rebirth this motherland earth for our sake.       ¬†¬†¬†¬†    		0
 Before participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program, I had never left the country, driven a tractor, or even tended to a garden. Once I graduated high school, I figured it was time to venture out into the world and try something new; I wanted "to see the world" before I had to get serious about my life. After some research, I discovered the Seagoing Cowboys program and immediately knew it was the right decision for me.    Initially, I was unsure what to expect. I had never been on a boat before and get seasick easily. However, I was assured that we would stick to more protected bodies of water, so I didn't have anything to worry about. I'm glad I didn't allow my fear to hold me back because this experience has been incredible. Not many people can say they've been to Alaska and Hawaii, let alone delivered cattle to both places!  Participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program has been one of the best decisions I've made. I've seen things I never thought I'd see, met people I never thought I'd meet, and experienced things I never thought I'd experience. I'm glad that I got the opportunity to take part in this unique program and encourage anyone else considering it to take the leap! You might be surprised at how much you grow from the experience.   Of course, there are certain drawbacks. The work is difficult, and it can be scary at times, but it is certainly worth it. You'll make plenty of great memories and have loads of incredible stories to tell. If you're thinking about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, do it! You won't regret it. 		1
The thought of summer brings out joyous feelings; people usually think of summer as vacations, time to hang out with friends, explore new hobbies, relax, etc. When students are asked to describe summer, one of the last things they would describe it as is a time to do school projects since most students actually picture it as a break from stressful schoolwork. School is the last thing on their mind throughout summer, which could cause students to put off their projects to the side to do last minute and think of it as a chore, rather than something that is enjoyable or fun to complete. However, this image can be changed and summer projects can be turned into something that students are motivated to do. If summer projects were student-designed rather than teacher-designed, it could be more catered to what students' interests and likes, students could be more motivated to complete them, and they would be less likely to procrastinate on them.  Student-designed summer projects would have more of what students want since it would be more catered to what they like. Students know each others' needs and what they enjoy--they can agree on what could be considered a fun project and what they consider to be stress-inducing project. With student-designed summer projects, more of a students' likes would be covered, which means it would be more enjoyable for them to work on it over the summer. With more of their interests in a project and with a project they deem as fun--or any type of work at all--students would be more likely to spend more time and energy on it. With teacher-designed summer projects, less interests could be covered, leading to students not putting as much into it as they would if it was student-designed. With student-designed summer projects, these would appeal more to them than a teacher-designed project would, because, as aforementioned, students know what students want to see in projects. When summer projects are student-designed instead of teacher-designed, it would be more catered to what they want and with their interests--which can bring many great benefits to students while working on them.  With more summer projects catered to students, students would be more motivated to complete these projects. They would be eager to work on these projects. Teachers do not understand what students want since they are from different generations, they do not know the current trends or hobbies that they enjoy as much as a student would know. When these projects are designed from people their own age, they know what each other usually like or enjoy. Their interests being addressed would give them a motivation to complete these summer projects, and not only that, but they would genuinely enjoy doing them and most likely want to do them. With motivation, students are able to produce better work. When people are less motivated to complete assignments, they usually put it off to the side or are not able to work as efficiently on it. When students are given projects that they genuinely like, they would stay on track and possibly even go out of their way to go above and beyond from what is asked of them and try and learn more about it on their own. Motivation can boost students to do better, so when summer projects appeal to them more, they would be more motivated to learn more and improve.  Procrastination is a common theme throughout students, but can be helped if they are assigned something they like to do. With student-designed projects, since students would be more motivated and have more of their interests in them, which would lead them to be less likely to procrastinate. With teacher-designed projects, they would be more likely to procrastinate since it might not cover things that a student wants to see as much as a student-designed project. That could lead to the student retaining less knowledge and learning less from the project, which is the opposite of what it is intended to do. When students do not procrastinate and leave it last minute, they are able to spend more time on a project and learn more from it. They would not view these projects as a chore or as something that they have to get done before summer ends.¬†Not only that, but they would be able to work more efficiently on it with more time spent. Others might also claim that a teacher-designed project would be more effective than a student-designed one since a teacher could have more experiences than a student and a teacher knows the materials more; however, a student-designed summer project would be formated more familiarly for students. Students know how each other work, and each generation differs from one another. Their projects would cater to their generation more and include things that they like to work on. Also, others could argue that some would still procrastinate and push it off to the side anyways, regardless of it being teacher-designed or student-designed. However, not all solutions can solve a hundred percent of the issue at hand but having student-designed projects could still solve the majority of the problems a teacher-designed project produces. So student-designed projects better address the large issue of procrastination among the youth--more than a teacher-designed project--and help students be able to grasp more of the concepts being taught and learn and retain more from these projects.  In conclusion, a student designed summer project would be the most efficient way for students to be able to continue learning throughout their summer break, and not only that, but have a project that contains their interests which can lead to having motivation to complete them and not procrastinate on. This would be the most efficient way since it is catered to what they want since students know what each other want best. The image of summer being fun would continue to exist and these summer projects would be enjoyable to complete and look forward to.¬†		0
Summer assignments are the bane of any student's desire to enjoy the three months of freedom from school. However, they are critical in order to ensure that the student continues his or her education while not in school. With this in mind, these summer projects should be designed by the teacher to allow for more a more in-depth education about the subject when the school year starts up once again.  The point of summer projects, first and foremost, is to ensure that students gain or retain requisite knowledge for the course. This means that the student is trusted to enrich himself or herself with the required knowledge to complete the assignment. One example of such is the summer assignment required for AP Calculus BC at Generic_School. Students were required to complete a 16-page packet that covered all of the material that was covered the previous year: parametrics, polar coordinates and systems, limits, derivatives, applications of limits and derivatives, trigonometry, and so on. They were then expected to take a test on all of that material two weeks after the school year started up again. The purpose of this assignment was to ensure the student retained the requisite knowledge before progressing further into the school year. This meant that only two weeks were required to review the material from the previous year, allowing the class to progress at an accelerated rate because the students had already displayed mastery over the previous year's material.  Another example of a summer assignment ensuring that students gain necessary knowledge prior is the summer assignment for AP English Language and Composition. This assignment differs from the previous example in that it focused more on educating students on how to compose and analyze well-written pieces of literature. Students were required to read two books:  On Writing by Stephen King and  Educated by Tara Westover.  On Writing , a memoir about King's life and a guide on how to write, taught students about how to compose meaningful writing, covering aspects like cognizance of tone, diction, sentence and paragraph length, visual appeal of the text, conveying detail properly, and so on. Students were required to create a "writer's toolbox" just as King did in his book, listing out seven tips in King's memoir and seven additional tips that the student had learned from previous experience. Such tips included not beginning a sentence with a conjunction, weaving simple, compound, and complex sentences to make a piece of writing more appealing, creating a sound structure for an essay, and keeping the audience in mind when writing. Students were then required to apply those skills in analyzing the rhetorical choices of Tara Westover in her book,  Educated . Students chose two aspects of writing that they found from reading  On Writing and analyzed how Westover used those aspects to create her autobiography. This allowed students to learn how to analyze a piece of literature from a rhetorical perspective rather than a literary perspective. Because students had this introductory experience, they were able to conduct rhetorical analyses at a more in-depth level during the school year.  Summer assignments, annoying as they are, are definitely useful tools to give students the opportunity to establish foudational knowledge for a course they will be taking when the school year starts once again. As such, these projects should be designed by the teachers of the course so they can move at an accelerated rate or spend more time speaking about smaller details or more complex ideas within the course. A student would not be able to craft such assignments because summer plans, vacations, and other priorities would take precedence over further education. Thus, it falls upon the teacher to ensure that the required knowledge is gained for the course before the start of the school year.		0
Growing up in a supportive family environment can have a tremendous impact on decision making for teens. Having a secure and understanding home to return to gives them the confidence to make decisions that are right for them and follow their own path. On the other hand, growing up in an unsupportive home can be an obstacle for teens who may feel judged and disrespected. This can lead to an atmosphere of fear and hesitancy when making decisions.  No matter the home environment, it is important for teens to recognize their own intrinsic value. This can be a difficult skill to learn since teenagers are still developing their sense of identity and finding direction in life. It is essential for teens to have the strength of mind to understand that they don't have to conform to the expectations of others in order to be accepted or to succeed. Learning to trust and be true to themselves is a valuable asset that can help teens succeed in academics, relationships, and life.		1
 Driverless cars are an emerging technology that is gaining popularity among many people. They are also known as autonomous cars or self-driving cars. The idea behind these cars is to provide a safe and efficient way of transportation without the need for human drivers. In this essay, we will discuss the benefits and limitations of driverless cars.  One of the biggest benefits of driverless cars is the increased safety they offer. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), human error is responsible for 94% of all traffic fatalities in the United States. Driverless cars have the potential to eliminate this issue entirely. They use sensors, cameras, and AI algorithms to detect and respond to their surroundings, reducing the risk of accidents significantly.  Another benefit of driverless cars is the increased efficiency they can offer. They are designed to work optimally in real-time traffic, which can lead to faster commute times and reduced fuel consumption. They can also be programmed to take the most efficient route to their destination, further increasing their efficiency.  However, there are also limitations to driverless cars. One of the biggest limitations is the cost of the technology. Driverless cars are expensive and require significant investment in infrastructure, such as road sensors and AI systems. Additionally, there are concerns about the reliability and safety of the technology. While driverless cars are designed to be safe, there have been instances where incidents have occurred.  Another limitation of driverless cars is the lack of human interaction during the commute. They are designed to work in a completely automated mode, which can be isolating for passengers. Additionally, there are concerns about job losses in the transportation industry, as automation could replace human drivers.  In conclusion, driverless cars offer numerous benefits, such as increased safety and efficiency. However, there are also limitations to the technology, such as the cost, reliability, and lack of human interaction. As the technology continues to develop and evolve, it is important to consider both the benefits and limitations of driverless cars to ensure that they are used in a responsible and sustainable manner.		1
Many people think that aliens are real, but they're not! Many people believe that this photo is caused by aliens. They don't know the true story of this and that it has to be caused by natural landform. There's no proof that aliens are real and no one really proved it at all! People just assume that it's caused by aliens because they see a big hole, but it's natural landform. Until I see proof that aliens are real then I will believe them, but right now there is no proof at all.  Many people think that it's caused by aliens, but it's not. It even said, "NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a "huge rock formation." It may look like a face, but that's just how it is. Conspiracy theorists don't even know what they're talking about. They just assume things, but they never show proof. NASA even showed proof that it's not caused by alien, but it may look like it was caused by aliens. It's just a natural landform.  Many people waited to see if the natural landform was actually caused by aliens. JPL revealed that it was a natural landform and that there was no alien monument after all. Many people still believe that it's caused by aliens and people even showed proof that it's not caused by aliens. Not everyone was satisfied that it was a natural landform because, "The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face." There really hasn't been a single one proof that aliens actually exist.  Although, the natural landform does look like an alien, but that's just how the natural landform is. The picture was actually showing us a butte or mesa, which is a landform that is common around the American West. So, this is common here, in the Earth, so this has to be common in Mars. They even said, "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." So, it was provened to be a mesa.  Many people thought that this picture was to be an alien. Many people, including NASA, even showed proof that it wasn't an alien. NASA at first did think that it was an alien, until they showed us proof of what they researched. People even showed us proof that it was just mesa, which is common to happen. It may look like it was caused by an alien, but it was just a natural landform that looks like an alien. 		0
There is a new trend going on in Europe. The people of Europe are creating a way of life to go back to when there were no cars. They have decided to live with out automobiles. In Germany a place called Vauban is a car free area. They have left the modern life to live as suburban pioneers. This is a experimental district out side of other towns to be completely car free. The advantages of reducing car usage is that they are reducing green house gasses, reduce smog, and to live happier.  First, in Vauban the communities are trying to reduce green house gasses drasticaly by exicuting car usage in that area. 70% of Vauban families are car free and 57% sold there cars to move there. It is important to them to reducethe amount of exoust from cars to reduce green house gasses.  Second, in Colombia the people are dealing with a major smog problem caused by the burning of fossile fuels. They have decide to band car usage for on day to take away stress and reduce air polution. Their goal was to create an alternitive trans portation system and to reduce smog. during car free day people walked, biked, skated, or took buses to their work all to be a part of a cleaner place.  lastly, these people who are being a part of cleaning their cities of smog and green house gasses all seem to be happier and have less stress. In Vauban people are saying that having no cars is stress free and they seem to live happier. Also in Colombia they are all happy to be a part of car free day to reduce smog.  In conclusion, the new trend in Europe are rising and and oter countries are fallowing. These are the advantages to limiting car usage.    		0
Generic_Name 3-9-20  Writing SOL  Distance Learning  Over the years people have come up with alternatives to attending to public or private school. These alternatives are online school, video conferencing, and home school. While some prefer the idea of leaving the house and going to school people have become more open minded about distance learning.  Personally I am for the idea of distance learning. Distance learning gives students a more comfortable environment to work in.  Distance learning is great, because it doesnt take a toll on your mental health. Going to school can make people feel like they have to live up to a certain standard to feel accepted. School can leave kids feeling depressed and alone. Distance learning is great, because when you are learning from home students are not seeking the validation of their peers. When kids attend school they worry a lot about what people think of them and that can distract them from doing what they need to do. When learning from home students can act dress however they want in the comfort of their own home. Students also wont be as hesitant to ask questions because they are not worried about not feeling as smart as other students.  Another benefit of doing distance school is not having to worry about being late. If a student wakes up late they can just log in and do their work. Students wont have to worry about getting dressed and rushing to get to school on time because their school, will be on their devices. Its convenient for student because they no longer need to catch the bus. Parents can also benefit because they no longer have to wake up early to drive their kids to and from the bus stop or school.  When going to public school you have to worry¬†about a lot of things. The things that students worry about are waking up early and going to bed on time all while have to do a bunch of homework and some even do after school activities. A lot of time because students have to worry about all these things at once they dont go to bed at a decent time. Students get a bunch of homework all at once and are still expected to get a full eight hours of sleep. some people can only get three because they are constantly given more and more work. This is why a lot of students are sleep deprived and fall asleep during lessons. Online school is more lenient because while there are deadlines students have more time to work because they dont always have to worry about after school sports and clubs. A lot of the time students who work online have more free time because they can do their work whenever as long as it is done on time.  A lot of the time online school students have more free time. Since they have more free time they can get a job that pays well. Students that attend public school sometimes dont have time for jobs because they are juggling homework and after school activities. A lot of students do have jobs though but it is harder when they have other things to do that are school related.  Overall distance learning is a good idea that I think a lot more people will be using in the future. Even though you are losing some when doing online school you are also gaining a lot. I think it is a good idea for students struggling with their mental health and dont like environment they are in at public school.¬†		0
 Online education and homeschooling offer many benefits, including the ability to work at your own pace, have more time for extracurricular activities, and learn new things. However, this flexibility can also be a challenge for some people.  For those who prefer to work alone and move at their own pace, online classes can be a great option. They allow you to take the time you need to complete your work and learn new things, without the constraints of a traditional classroom schedule. This can be especially beneficial for those who are trying to pursue a different career path or interest that requires more time and less time in a traditional classroom setting.  However, for others, the lack of structure and support can make it harder to learn. Online classes often require more self-motivation and discipline, and it can be difficult to get the help you need when you need it. This is why it's important to be aware of your own learning style and to seek out support when you need it.  It's also important to remember that online education and homeschooling are not the only options available. There are many traditional classroom settings that offer a variety of extracurricular activities and opportunities for hands-on learning. It's important to consider all of your options and to choose the one that best fits your learning style and goals.  In conclusion, online education and homeschooling can be a great option for those who prefer to work alone and move at their own pace. However, it's important to be aware of the challenges and to seek out support when you need it. Ultimately, the most important thing is to find the learning environment that works best for you and to take advantage of all of the opportunities that are available to you.		1
The principal has chosen¬†to make each student participate in an extracurricular activity. So now students are forced to join a sports team or a club every day, but not every student is able to participate. Students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because they may be too busy, uninterested, or they don't have the energy to.  Students may have things they must do that are not school related once they get home. For many of them, they have to do chores such as cleaning the house or walking a dog. Others may have to go home and watch younger siblings because their parents come home late and forcing them to go after school activities prevents them from helping their family. Some students may even have a job such as a cashier at a local supermarket that they have to go to in order to provide for themselves and their family.  Most of the time though, students are just uninterested in participating. Some students feel as if the dont need to stay at school for another two hours or more when they are already required to be there for seven. Although some of the students might not like joining a sports team, the student council, or any of the other activities that are available.  School can also be very draining for students. School is a very social place and the students of a school usually fall into three categories. Many students can be a extrovert which means the enjoy socializing and feel energized doing so. They may also be a introvert and are they exact opposite of extroverts because they prefer to be alone. They can still be social they just prefer to do less. Then there are students that fall in between which are known as ambiverts. So depending on how the students feel about social interaction it will effect their desire to socialize more after school. School is also very stressful to the majority of students. That results in a lot of students being exhausted¬†and just wanting to go home and sleep.  Students do not need to stay after school because they have things to do that are not school related, are not interested, and many don't have the energy to. Schools want their students to be more engaged in their learning but if schools are unable to let students take a break from it then more and more students stressed since they can not do the other things that they are required to do and make them feel like school is a prison.¬†		0
In the story the author gives us reasonable decisions on why we should go to Venus. It forms like earth and its clled the Earth? twin sister. The author provides a lot of information. One of them states ¬®  may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago,Venus was probably covered laregley with oceans and coul have supported various forms of life¬® this cold very well be a lot like earth. There are sea level just like earth and there ¬® familiar features such as valleys ,mountains,and craters.¬®These areall the same thing that Earth has,It also says that this Venus could have very well had ocean covering all of it.  The atricle states that they are going on missions and gettin machines to go and figure out why Venus is so much more life-like Earth. The nNAtional Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is trying to do visits with humans to see if they can live there Becuase it states that ¬® iNot easy conditions, but it is survivable for humans¬®which very well means that we can live there for a long period of time. They are doing so ich reasearch on this planet becuase they are worried of Earth very well not being here one day.  This could go both wasy this could very well be a successful mission or it could be a very dangerous and unsure mission. That are traking research and countinuing finding more ways to make sure that humans will not have any problems while living in Venus. When they have everything solved they will send humans and see how their bodies will react to the way Venus makes them. Never know this ight be the next great discovery that NASA wil make happen and save all of us.    		0
"As a high school student, I have witnessed the growing influence of social media on our daily lives. While platforms like Facebook and Twitter offer many benefits, such as staying connected with friends and family, they also raise concerns about privacy. As more personal information is being shared online, it's crucial to consider whether stronger privacy protections are needed on social media.  On one hand, proponents of stronger privacy protections argue that users should have greater control over their personal data. They believe that companies should be more transparent about how they collect, use, and share user information. Additionally, they advocate for stricter regulations to prevent misuse of personal data by third-party companies or advertisers. These measures could help protect users from potential identity theft, cyberbullying, and other online risks.  However, opponents argue that individuals already have the ability to control their privacy settings and decide what information they want to share. They claim that adding more regulations would stifle innovation and limit the benefits of social media. Moreover, enforcing stricter rules may prove challenging given the global nature of these platforms and differences in privacy laws across countries.  In my opinion, while users do have some control over their privacy settings, the current system can be confusing and difficult to navigate. Many people may not realize the extent to which their data is being collected and shared. Furthermore, the potential consequences of having one's personal information fall into the wrong hands can be severe. Therefore, I believe stronger privacy protections are necessary.  These protections could include clearer explanations of how user data will be used, easier access to privacy settings, and more robust security measures to prevent hacks and data breaches. Additionally, there should be consistent international standards for protecting user privacy, regardless of where the user or the platform is located.  In conclusion, as social media continues to play an increasingly prominent role in our lives, it's essential to ensure that users' privacy rights are respected and protected. While there may be arguments against stronger privacy protections, I believe the potential risks outweigh any potential downsides. By implementing clearer guidelines and better security measures, we can help create a safer and more secure online environment for everyone."		1
Cars are creating an harmful environment with problems such as smog and traffic. Reduction on car usage can help these problems. Although cars may be a faster transportation, they add on to the havoc of the environment. Reducing car usage has many advantages. It would help develop a better environment and improve people's well being.  An advantage of reduction of car usage is it helps develop a better environment to live in. Some areas which have cars create a lot of smog which is unhealthy for the environment. For example, "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog" (Duffer). Smog is formed by cold nights and warm days which causes the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Without so many cars, this issue can decrease. It will help the environment progress and be safer for everyone. Statistics show that "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States" (Rosenthal). Cars are causing air pollution. If cars are still the dominant transportation, the environment will still suffer from air pollution such as smog. It's safer to use a large vehicle such as a bus to get around because a bus can hold many more people than a car and would ultimately give off less gas than the population of people who use cars.¬† Another safe way around town would be vehicles which don't give off gases into the air such as bicycles. A safer environment is a better environment.  Another advantage of reduction of cars is improvement of people's well being. With air pollution from cars, humans inhale toxic gases which can be detrimental to their bodies. If car usage plunders, people's bodies will feel better. A businessman said "It's good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" (Plaza). Lowering the number of cars being used helps relieve stress. Nobody wants to be stressed out from traffic or being late to work. With cars there is always a place where there is traffic. Ultimately, reduction of car usage has numerous effects that benefit the society. A media trainer and mother of two stated, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" (Walter). Without a car, you don't have to worry about being severely injured since most of the population would transfer to the use of bikes or walking. Because the population would start a trend of riding bikes and walking, most of the roadways would now be unecessary to have and they could be built into something fundamental such as a park, a housing area, or a food market. There would be less worries altogether and this could be more beneficial to the society.  There are many positive effects from reducing car usage. Environment will progress and people's well being will improve. It's beneficial for everyone to limit the use of cars and find other transportation. There would be a safer environment from less smog and rush-hour restrictions. Also, the environment will be people-friendly from more parks and sports centers. Limiting car usage effects society positively.    		0
umm, maybe we can settle downoff the cars !!, i beleive that can be an good idea for citizens in the united states without cars this can be a better world for me and people in my community and my city , this can help reduce the amount of air pollution from cars and¬† from other automobiles ,another way¬† we can decrease the use of cars is by having a car-free week. these ways can make a big change in the way people use cars¬† in thisx culture.  the reduce in car usage can help people from getting sick from trucks and cars from polluting the air, not only can people get sick but animals such as,dogs cats and some farm animals wat humans eat. the pollution in the air can cause plants to¬† die what farm animals feed on,for example where i live i saw an horse suffering from¬† dead plants. also, car pollution¬† can sometimes cause crashes because of all the smoke from an bad engine or even car that fan can be over heated, for instance one time i was on my way to walmart on a very hot day , all of a¬† sudden smoke started coming from my mom smoke pipe under the car, the cause of this was because her fan was over heated. there can be many ways an car can cause¬† pollution in the air thats why we need to slow down on¬† the car population or usage a day.  air pollution can be a major way fror the president to pass an law about car usage. but,¬† another way to stop people from using there cars. are by having an week off from cars and big trucks,if we have an week off from cars¬† more people¬† would be walking more or riding bicycles. for example, according to the seattle times in the city of bogota¬† people had less stress from being jammed up in traffic and lower air pollution. ,moreover, this can help because it can slow down the amount of fuel people use in a day. just imagine one week without cars this people can be able to catch the bus instead of driving. without cars people could slive better.    		0
 Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel. These cars use a combination of sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to navigate roads and highways, allowing drivers to relax and focus on other tasks.   One of the main advantages of driverless cars is increased safety. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, human error is a contributing factor in 94% of accidents on the road. Driverless cars have been shown to be significantly safer than human-driven vehicles, as they are able to detect and respond to potential hazards in real-time.   Driverless cars also have the potential to reduce traffic congestion. With the ability to communicate with each other, these cars can adjust their speed and route to avoid traffic jams, allowing for smoother and more efficient travel. This could also lead to a reduction in the time spent on the road, reducing carbon emissions and improving air quality.   Additionally, driverless cars could provide greater accessibility to transportation for those who are unable to drive, such as the elderly or disabled. This could lead to increased independence and quality of life for these individuals, and could also reduce the burden on caregivers.   Despite the potential benefits, there are also concerns about the safety and reliability of driverless cars. However, as technology advances, these concerns are being addressed. Safety features such as automatic emergency braking and lane departure warnings are becoming more widespread, and companies are investing heavily in research and development to ensure the reliability and safety of driverless cars.   In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to offer many benefits, including increased safety, reduced traffic congestion, and greater accessibility to transportation. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that these cars will become a common sight on our roads. It is important for policy makers and industry leaders to work together to ensure that these cars are safe and reliable, and to take advantage of their potential to improve our transportation system.		1
Cars have always been used to get from point A to point B. That is how the people in society know what cars are for. However, there are other alternatives when is comes to going form one destination to another. Citizens should limit their car usage. It helps with the terrible traffic on the street. Also, there will be no more pollution in the air. In addition, citizens can be able to enjoy the world.  Everyone has been caught in traffic, whether it is going to work or school or meeting up with someone. Everyone has been in traffic before. People can prevent traffic form happening. There is carpooling, it can help limit traffic on the streets. Just like it states in source three, "...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." There are other ways to avoid and stop traffic. Not everyone needs to take their own personal car to work. They can either car pool or take public transportation to save money because gas isn't cheap these days. In addition, traffic sometimes end up leading to accidents. There are several people who died in a car accident due to someone speeding because he or she doesn't want to wait in the traffic. However, if everyone just finds another alternative way to get to his or her destination, then no one has to die. Just like it explains in proclaims in source four, "pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety." This qoute listed some alternatives way to get somewhere. By doing these things it will not only limit the traffic but the resources and the safety of other people. Traffic isn't a fun place to be in, so find another way to get to his or her destination can prevent traffic.  Air pollution is everywhere we go. Whether someone travels to Japan, India, or South America. There willbe air pollution there. It might not have same amount of air pollution as other countries but there is still pollution. Why? Because there are people who uses his or her personal car not thinking about what happens to the air that they breathe. However, there is a solution to limit the pollution in the air. Limiting car usage or find another way to get to the certain destination. Mr. siva even claims that "A car is just a means of getting from A to B..." Cars is just a means of transportation. So are bicycles, trucks, buses, traind. However, all these have one thing in common, they are all going form destination A to destination B. Biking, walking, skating are some way to stop the gas from the vehicles from polluting the air. Actually, by using these methods pollution can be reduced. For example source three states, "...uneven, pitted sidewalks have bee replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic..." When people don't use his or her car and decides to find another way to get to their destination it helps reduce the traffic.  There are several people who say that they know what the real world is since he or she travels all the time in their car. However, do people really know the sounds of kids laughter when walking down the side walk or a bicycle bell violently ringing at someone to get out of their way? Not a lot of people know this because they are usually used to their vehicles getting them places. People will argue that they have heard all of those before and that they were happier. But Ms. Walter thinkgs other wise, "When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Ms. Walter has been walking on the streets and she hears the swish of bicycles and the talkative children and occastional a distant motor. These help people better appreciate the world that they live in because not everything will last forever. In addition to this, less cars means more people walking which means that several people will end up walking pass a shop and look what is inside. For instance in source three is explains, "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed through the city uneven...and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up." It helps by walking to find new stores or restaurants people never heard of.  Several people believe that the only way to get somewhere is by car. That isn't necessarily true. Skating, walking, biking, car pooling or public transportation can help get anyone from point A to B. Yes, it will take longer on foot than by car but it helps the environment, it stops from the air getting all the gasoline form the cars. It is faster than being stuck in traffic. Someone who is biking to school can be five minutes late while soneone who is took their car and got stuck in traffic can be an hour late. Limiting car usage is a way that everyone can explore the world than being stuck in that four or tw door car. Limiting car usage has its downs but it also have its perks.		0
 As the sun rose over the city, Emily could see the smog hanging in the air. It was a reminder of why they needed to act now to reduce car usage. She had always loved walking through the city, but in the last few years, it had become almost impossible to do so without having to dodge traffic and breathe in the fumes.  Emily had always been concerned about the environment, but it was only when she moved to the city that she realized how bad things had gotten. She remembered growing up in the suburbs, where she could walk to school and play outside without worrying about the air quality. But now, even walking to the store or taking public transportation could be a challenge.  That's why she was so excited when she heard about the new initiative to reduce car usage in the city. The plan included improving public transportation, adding more bike lanes, and increasing the number of electric vehicles on the road. She could already see the difference it was making - the air was starting to clear, and she could walk down the street without having to worry about being run over.  Emily knew that there were still some people who were opposed to the plan. They complained about the inconvenience of having to change their habits or the cost of implementing the new initiatives. But Emily believed that the benefits of reducing car usage far outweighed the costs. She could see the positive impact it was having on the environment, and she knew that it would make the city a better place to live for everyone.  As she walked home from work that evening, Emily could see the sun setting behind the city's skyline. She smiled, thinking about how far they had come and how much further they could go. She was proud to be a part of this community, and she looked forward to seeing what the future held for them. 		1
Hey, so for this essay, I'm gonna talk about how working in groups is way better than working alone. Like, I know some people might think it's cool to just sit there by yourself and do your work, but trust me, group work is where it's at.  First of all, when you're in a group, you can share ideas. Like, if you're working on a project or something, you can come up with ideas together. You might think of something that's totally genius, but your group members might have other ideas that are even better. It's like, you can build off of each other's thoughts and come up with something way more awesome than you could have done on your own. Plus, it's not just about the project, it's about learning how to work together and communicate effectively.  Another thing is that when you're in a group, you can help each other out. Like, if one person is struggling with something, the others can help them out. It's not just about doing your own work, it's about supporting your group members and making sure everyone does well. And it's not just about school work either, it's about life in general. Like, if you're in a group of friends, you can help each other out with stuff like moving or planning a party. It's just more fun and productive when you're working together.  And finally, working in groups can help you learn from each other. Like, you might have a different perspective on something than your group members do, and they might teach you something new. It's like, you can learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and become a better person because of it. Plus, it's not just about learning from each other, it's about learning how to work with people who have different personalities and styles.  So yeah, that's my essay. I think working in groups is way better than working alone, and I have research to back it up. Like, there are studies that show that group work can lead to better grades and higher test scores. And it's not just about academics, it's about life skills too. So next time you're assigned to work in a group, don't be afraid		1
 Dear State Senator,  I am writing to express my views on the electoral college system and its effectiveness in determining the president of the United States. In my opinion, the electoral college is a vital part of our democracy that ensures that every state's voice is heard in the selection of the president.  One of the primary arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it allows states with smaller populations to have a proportional say in the election. For example, California, with a population of over 39 million people, has more voting power than a state like Wyoming, which has a population of only 579,777 people. Without the electoral college, California's vote would dominate the election, and smaller states would be left out in the cold.  Furthermore, the electoral college system encourages campaigning in all 50 states, not just in a few large states like California and New York. This ensures that every state's concerns are addressed and that the candidate is accountable to the needs of the entire country, not just a select few.  However, some argue that the electoral college is an outdated system that no longer represents the will of the people. They claim that the popular vote should be the determining factor in the election, and that the electoral college has the potential to distort the will of the people.  While it is true that the popular vote has not always aligned with the electoral college vote, there have been many instances where the two have been in agreement. Additionally, the electoral college vote has been determined by the will of the people through the electoral process, which is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.  In conclusion, I believe that the electoral college system should remain in place as it ensures that every state's voice is heard in the selection of the president, and it encourages campaigning in all 50 states. While there may be some potential downsides to the system, the benefits of a democratic republic that listens to each state's concerns outweigh any potential drawbacks.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
In society today kids have to much free time on their hands, and when kids have too much free time they tend to get into trouble. If they took away some of that free time then kids would have less time to get themselves into trouble, and it would also keep them off of technology. I agree¬†that every kid should have at least¬†one extracurricular activity after school.  The extracurricular activities keeps kids engaged and involved in their school community. It keeps them busy and moving around it doesn't leave them time to sit around and get in trouble. With the extracurricular activities kids wouldn't go home and have nothing to do. It also keeps their brain engaged and thinking. Kids would be learning something new and interesting everyday. They could learn a new sport and stay active at the same time. Many kids these days just go home and sit around, that isn't good for their health they need to be moving around at this age. Extracurricular actives could also teach valuable skills and lessons like how to work in a team or how to take responsibility¬†for actions or people. These are very important skills in life,and it is very hard to teach those skills in a classroom but it is a lot easier to do on a sports field or in a extraculiclar activity.  Extracurricular activities could help kids become more social. When you join an extracurricular¬†activity chances are you are in there with some new people that they have never met before. It gives kids a chance to meet new people their age and become friends with them. It could also help the kids that are less social or shy become more social. These kids have a hard time talking to other people and if they are given the chances to meet people and talk to them on a regular basses then hopefully they will become less shy and more social. It can also give these kids something to talk about to others. Like how their team is doing or how¬†they like their activities. It also can help kids get over fears. Maybe a kid has stage fright and they try out for theater and the excel at it and get over the fear of stage fright. Or a kid has a fear of public speaking and they try out for the debate team and that helps the get over that fear.  It could also help kids figure out what their strengths and weaknesses are maybe they go into a sport and find out that they are really good at being a leader. That could possibly open their eyes later on down the road when they are picking their career choice or singing up for collages.  Most importantly it keeps kids out of trouble. With an extracurricular activity right after school kids can't sneak off after school and go get into trouble with their friends. Their going to be held accountable to go to their after school activity and not be late to it. This will help them develop¬†responsablitty.  With out extraculiclar activity some kids just go home and get on technology and don't do anything. But with an activity after school it would get them moving around and not sitting on the couch all day.  An extracurricular activity would also help kids get off their phone and social media. This would also help with kids not getting in trouble on social media because the extraculirrclar activities would be phone free and the more time we get kids off of their¬†phones the less likely they're going to get¬†in trouble on them.  There are a lot of positives to having extraculliclar activities after school. It would help kids in a numerous amount of ways like not getting into trouble, getting off of technology,being more social, becoming more active and healthy,and becoming more engaged.¬†		0
As an eighth-grade student, I believe that relying on others is an essential aspect of life. While being independent and individualistic can be beneficial in certain situations, it is ultimately better to rely on others for support and guidance. In this essay, I will discuss why relying on others is important in life and why it is better than being completely independent and individualistic.  Firstly, relying on others can provide emotional support and companionship. Life can be challenging, and it is not uncommon to feel overwhelmed and alone. In these situations, having someone to turn to for emotional support can make all the difference. Whether it's a friend, family member, or counselor, having someone to listen and offer guidance can help alleviate stress and provide a sense of comfort. Additionally, having someone to share experiences with and form meaningful relationships with can enrich one's life and make it more fulfilling.  Secondly, relying on others can provide practical support and assistance. Life requires a variety of skills and knowledge, and it is not uncommon to find oneself in situations where they lack the necessary resources or expertise. In these cases, relying on others can be invaluable. Whether it's asking for help with a homework assignment, seeking advice on a career path, or getting assistance with a household task, relying on others can help one overcome obstacles and achieve their goals.  Finally, relying on others can promote personal growth and development. When we rely on others, we are forced to step outside of our comfort zones and interact with people from diverse backgrounds and experiences. This exposure to different perspectives and ways of thinking can help us develop empathy, communication skills, and a greater understanding of the world around us. Additionally, relying on others can help us learn from our mistakes and grow as individuals. When we receive feedback and constructive criticism from others, we can use that information to improve ourselves and become better versions of ourselves.  In conclusion, relying on others is an important aspect of life. While being independent and individualistic can be beneficial in certain situations, it is ultimately better to rely on others for support and guidance. Relying on others can provide emotional support and companionship, practical support and assistance, and promote personal growth and development. By recognizing the value of relying on others, we can enrich our lives and become better individuals.		1
There are many car free cities. Germany suburb life goes on without cars, Automobiles are the linchoin of suburbs. They to to say that it is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas. In Paris driving has been ban to clear the air of the global society, motorists were orderd to leave there cars at home or suffered a 31$ fine. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and people had their cars inpound for their reaction to the fine.  Cars have been banned with only buses, taxis permitteed for the day. the goal was to promote alterenative transportation and reduce smog. Not even the rain has stopped people from participating, "its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said Carlos Arturo Plaza. a day without cars is an improvement campaign that begaN in Bogota in the late¬† mid-1990s.  In the United States, recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The question was asked; has America passed peak driving? the United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world's prime cultures. But Americas love affair with its vehicles seeems to be cooling. When adjusted for popullation growth, the number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 dropped steadily. Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployment weren't going to work anyway.  There are many car free cities. mostly because of green house gasses or many other cuases. Such as stress' and air pollution cars have been banned to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. There are been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser and better for walking.       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†       ¬†¬†¬†¬†       ¬†¬†¬†¬†       ¬†       ¬†¬†¬†¬†     		0
 Facial expression is a complex aspect of human communication that often carries more meaning than what is said through words. For instance, a person might appear outwardly neutral while they are experiencing a range of emotions beneath their surface. This can be difficult to discern and interpret without training, leading one to wonder if there is a more accurate method to understand facial expressions. In recent years, engineers and researchers have been working on developing a technology called Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that can accurately capture and analyze facial expressions. This essay will argue that the use of FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.  FACS is a technology that is based on capturing the slightest movements of facial muscles. The technology was first developed for use in motion pictures and video games, but has since been repurposed for use in psychology, psychiatry, and other fields. In an interview, Paul Ekman, one of the original developers of FACS, stated that   Facial Action Coding System is an objective coding system that turns subjective, ambiguous expressions into action units that can be analyzed and quantified.    The ability to quantify and analyze facial expressions is valuable in a classroom setting because it can help teachers understand the emotional state of their students. Emotional intelligence is a critical skill that can have a significant impact on a student's academic success. Research has shown that students who have high emotional intelligence are better equipped to handle stress, are more self-aware, and are more effective communicators. FACS can provide teachers with an objective tool to measure these skills in their students.  Furthermore, FACS could be used to identify students who may be struggling with mental health issues. For instance, the technology could be used to identify students who are experiencing anxiety or depression, which are common mental health conditions that can be difficult to diagnose. Early intervention can be critical in helping these students overcome their mental health issues and achieve academic success.  However, some may argue that the use of FACS in the classroom is intrusive and invasive. There is a concern that students may feel uncomfortable or self-conscious when their facial expressions are being analyzed. Additionally, there is a risk that the technology could be used inappropriately or without the correct ethical considerations.  In conclusion, the use of Facial Action Coding System technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The technology provides an objective method for quantifying and analyzing facial expressions, which can be used to enhance teaching and learning, and identify students who may be struggling with mental health issues. However, it is important to ensure that the technology is used ethically and that students are aware of its use and potential implications.		1
I think that the principal's idea of making us do extracurricular activities is a bad idea. First of all, not everyone is interested in the same things. Like, I hate sports, so I wouldn't want to join a sports team. And I'm not really good at art, so I wouldn't want to work on the yearbook. And I don't like talking in front of people, so I wouldn't want to be on the student council.  Also, some people might have other things they want to do after school, like work or take care of their siblings. They shouldn't be forced to do something they don't want to do. It's not fair.  And what if someone doesn't want to do any extracurricular activities? That's their choice, right? They shouldn't be forced to do something they don't want to do.  I think the principal should let us choose if we want to do an extracurricular activity or not. It's our time, and we should be able to do what we want with it.  I know some people might say that extracurricular activities are good for us, and they can help us learn new skills and make new friends. But, I think we can learn new skills and make new friends in other ways, like by joining a club that we're actually interested in, or by volunteering in our community.  So, I think the principal should reconsider his decision and let us choose if we want to do an extracurricular activity or not. It's not fair to force us to do something we don't want to do.		1
Working in a group or working alone has been a topic of debate for years. Some people argue that working alone is more beneficial, while others believe that working in a group is more beneficial. In this essay, I will argue that working in a group is more beneficial than working alone.  One of the main benefits of working in a group is the opportunity to learn from others. When working in a group, individuals are exposed to different perspectives and ideas. This exposure can lead to new insights and a deeper understanding of the topic at hand. Additionally, group members can provide constructive feedback, which can help individuals improve their work.  Another benefit of working in a group is the ability to share workload. When working alone, individuals are solely responsible for completing the task. This can be overwhelming and lead to burnout. However, when working in a group, individuals can share the workload and help each other complete the task. This can lead to a more efficient and effective completion of the task.  Furthermore, working in a group can also lead to better communication. When working alone, individuals may not receive the same level of feedback or communication as they would in a group. This can lead to misunderstandings and a lack of progress. However, when working in a group, individuals have the opportunity to communicate with each other and receive feedback on their work. This can lead to better communication and a more effective completion of the task.  In conclusion, working in a group has many benefits over working alone. The opportunity to learn from others, share workload, and communicate effectively are just a few of the benefits. While working alone may have its benefits, the benefits of working in a group cannot be overlooked. Therefore, I strongly believe that working in a group is more beneficial than working alone.		1
## The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  Americans are known for their love of cars. From the early days of the automobile, cars have been a symbol of freedom and independence. However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. There are many reasons for this shift, including the environmental impact of cars, the high cost of owning and operating a car, and the traffic congestion that cars cause.  One of the most important reasons to limit car usage is the environmental impact of cars. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and they contribute to climate change. In fact, transportation is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, after electricity generation. Limiting car usage would help to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and it would benefit the environment.  The high cost of owning and operating a car is another reason to limit car usage. Cars are expensive to purchase, and they are also expensive to maintain and insure. In addition, the cost of gas has been rising steadily in recent years. Limiting car usage would save people money on transportation costs.  Traffic congestion is also a major reason to limit car usage. Traffic congestion causes delays and frustration for drivers. It also wastes fuel and contributes to air pollution. Limiting car usage would help to reduce traffic congestion and improve the quality of life for everyone.  There are many ways to limit car usage. One way is to walk or bike instead of driving. Walking and biking are great ways to get exercise and fresh air. They are also environmentally friendly. Another way to limit car usage is to take public transportation. Public transportation is a great way to get around without having to drive. It is also affordable and convenient. Finally, car sharing is another option for limiting car usage. Car sharing allows people to use a car when they need it without having to own one. This can save money and reduce the number of cars on the road.  Limiting car usage has many benefits for individuals and society as a whole. It is good for the environment, it saves money, and it reduces traffic congestion. There are many ways to limit car usage, and everyone can do their part to make a difference.  ## Conclusion  Limiting car usage is important for a number of reasons. It can help to reduce air pollution, save money, and improve the quality of life. There are many ways to limit car usage, and everyone can do their part to make a difference.		1
There is an ongoing debate around whether summer projects assigned to students should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Both approaches have merits, but on balance, I believe student-designed summer projects are preferable.   Allowing students to have input and choice in their summer learning allows them to pursue topics they find genuinely interesting and engaging. When students are intrinsically motivated by their course of study, they are more likely to learn deeply and retain information long-term. Teacher-designed projects run the risk of feeling like "more schoolwork" over break, discouraging exploration and fun ways of learning outside the classroom.   Giving students autonomy over their summer project fosters independence, creativity, and responsibility. By researching a self-selected topic in their own way, students practice skills like goal-setting, time management, and following personal interests that will serve them well beyond their schooling. They may discover new passions and talents when allowed to guide their own learning. Teachers act more as advisors and coaches than directors of the project.  Of course, fully open-ended student projects require parameters and check-ins to ensure learning goals are still met. A good compromise may be student-driven topics within pre-set categories determined by teachers. For example, students could research various science concepts, historical periods, or works of literature but select the specific focus of their work. Regular check-ins keep students accountable while respecting their autonomy.  Overall, empowering students as active agents in their education, including through student-designed summer projects, fosters lifelong learning habits. When the intrinsic rewards of exploring self-chosen topics are combined with teacher guidance, impactful learning can occur both in and out of the classroom. More student independence and choice in these projects is likely to engage students as stakeholders in their own development.		1
Even though the Electoral College is known as a disaster factor, it has its benefits. The Electoral College is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. Each candidate running in your state has his or her own group of electors that are voted for. When you vote on election day, which is held every four years on Tuesday after the first Monday in Novemeber, you vote for the candidate's electors. Many politicians wanted to abolish the Electoral College because of its lack of democratic pedigree, but the college doesn't allow voters of other regions to feel disenfranchised, it avoids run-off elections, and thinks that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.  The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal. It would not be fair for a candidate to campaign heavily in a state that they know they are going to win. This does not gain them any electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows will win. This causes voters that are from the opposite region to feel as if their votes did not count, that their new president would not care about their interests or values. The president would not really be their president because of the fact that they were ignored.  Voters that are more likely to pay attention to the campaign by listening to each opposing sides that compete against one another should decide the election. If voters that voted didn't care and picked the weaker candidate, then everyone would pay the price. The knowledgable voters listen to the competing candidates and will receive the most information and attention from the candidates. This leads to a candidate worthy enough to become president, which will choose the country's decisions for the next four years.  Run-off elections, where elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast is avoided. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast, which complicates the presidential election process, but is reduced by the Electoral College to announce a clear winner. The run-off election once happened to Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992.  Many argue the fact that the Electoral College method may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state. People knowing their vote will have no effect, will have less intentions of paying attention to the election then they would have if the president picked the popular vote. Voter's in presidential elections are people who want to express a political reference and want the best for their country's future rather than people who think one vote may decide the election and disregard the point of voting.       ¬†       ¬†¬†¬†¬†    		0
While summer projects aim to keep students engaged in learning during their break from the classroom, the best approach is to give students autonomy in designing their own projects. Teacher-designed projects risk feeling like an extension of the regular school year and losing the sense of freedom that summer break provides. Student-designed projects allow creativity and personal interests to drive learning.   If students are able to choose their own summer projects, they are more likely to select topics that truly interest and motivate them. When intrinsically motivated, students will put more effort and care into their work. They may tackle subject areas or skills that they genuinely wish to explore further on their own terms. On the other hand, teacher-assigned topics run the risk of feeling obligatory rather than stimulating personal growth and curiosity.   Giving students freedom to design their projects also empowers them to take ownership over their own education. They get to decide what they want to accomplish and learn more about during their break, setting meaningful personal goals. Taking charge of project selection promotes responsibility, independence, and self-directed learning skills that will serve students well as they progress into higher education or careers. In contrast, following a teacher's guidelines may undermine developing these critical competencies.    Of course, guidance should be available from teachers for students designing their own work. Parameters can assure projects align with course content and standards while still allowing flexibility. Teachers can offer topic suggestions aligned with curricula or student interests. One-on-one check-ins can help struggling students generate viable ideas. With support but not restriction, student-designed summer projects strike the best balance between continued learning and enjoyment of vacation time. Overall, this approach is most conducive to retaining information and enthusiasm for schooling throughout the summer months.		1
Dear Senator:  I think that the Electoral College should be changed to a popular vote. I have many reasons to believe that our system of choosing our president is corrupt. It needs to be layed out more clearly as to how to president should be chosen. It's not fair that some states have more electors than others based on population, we should all get a say as to who should become president.  The Electoral College is layed out in a way that states with a higher populous have more electors in the Electoral College. Even worse than that, if Florida, for example, were to win the Democratic vote for the state, the Democratic party would win all 29 electors. I think that if we should keep the Electoral College that the votes should at least be distributed evenly amongst all of the electors.  In 2000, Gore won more individual votes while Bush won the Electoral College votes. We ended up having a whole fiasco as to who should be elected president for that reason. It'd be alot easier if we had a more direct system of voting for president. The winner-take-all system is what helped Bush win the 2000 election, even though those votes were gained indirectly by a majority rule. It's almost like we don't even have to vote anymore and just let the Electoral College take all of our votes away.  That's why I think that the Electoral College should be changed to a more direct rule of electing the president. About 60% percent of people agree that we should change our system of electing the president. I hope to see the Electoral College changed.    		0
"The electoral college is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between electionn of the President by a vote in Congress and electionn of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens." The Electoral College is one of the most fair systems our society has set up. This process is fair and essential because it is is not the only determination, each state gets the correct amount of power, and it shows a clear winner.  The Electoral College does is not fully responsible for the outcome of the decision for our President. In the year 2000, this was proved, Gore had received more popular votes than Bush, yet fewer electoral votes. "It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote." The section of the nation that believes the Electoral College is unfair believes this because they assume all the power is in this system's hands. Yet they are mistaken because clearly our popular vote can override this system if necessary. Though it is very rare most will argue, the fact that it is possible to not allow the Electoral College to take control of our government proves that the power is really all in the hands of the citizens. Clearly, the "unfair" picture most perceive is largely mistaken.  The sizes of states in our country widely varies. From Rhode Island to Texas, we have power in Congress. It would simply not be fair if our small states had the same amout of power as our larger states. California has more of a population, therefore should have more say in Congress, than New Jersey. "Your states entitles allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators." Just the way this is set up in Congress, the same amount of power for each state is applied for choosing our President for the next four years. This is only fair to the population of America and equal representation in all the sections of congress would be unfair to the larger states that obviously require and deserve more power than the smaller states in the United States. Basically, power is fairly given to each state under the Electoral College.  "The Electoral College avoids the problem of electionns in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast." Though this situation is rare, in 1968 when Nixon ran against Clinton, both had a total of 43 percent of the popular votes. Yet, because of the Electoral College, a clear winner was shown. If ever in case of this event, this "pressure" can complicate and make the choosing of the President way more difficult than it was planned to be. For this reason, our Electoral College sets up a way to take care of this if it was to happen again. Obviously, the Electoral College shows a clear winner and takes out any confusion or problems that could arise.  To conclude, our country is based off of fair rules and systems, one of them being the Electoral College. It is fair because it does not have full power, the right amount of power is applied to each state, and it produces a clear winner. "Voters in presidential electionns are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.		0

The Seagoing Cowboys program is full of like-minded individuals who all share a passion for helping others and traveling. The sense of community and friendship that I gained from the program is something that I will always cherish.  Conclusion: In conclusion, everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. It allows you to have unique experiences, make a difference in the world, work with animals, and meet amazing people. I will always be grateful for the time that I spent in the Seagoing Cowboys program and the memories I made along the way. So, what are you waiting for? Join the Seagoing Cowboys program and start creating your own unforgettable memories!		1
Dear principal,  I think that the new school policy about students with at least a B average can only participate in sports or other activities is unfair. The reason I think this is because most students have C averages and are great athletes. Also to some people C averages are okay. I think that most people with C averages probably failed a test or didn't bring in some homeworks and the reasons to punish them to not being in sports is absurd.  Sometimes students have a C+ and then it goes up or a C+ and they don't have time to make it up. I mean this never happened to me because I don't make C's or anything lower but telling people that they cannot join a sports team for it is so unreasonable.  Another specific reason Is that people just don't have time or can't study. I think maybe having the team a little later when students get used to their studying and planning , then grades of school athletes might get better.  The only thing I am arguing for is changing the policy from a B average to a C average because unless you don't want great athletes if so then I say you change it !		0
Libraries have been a cornerstone of knowledge and learning for centuries. However, with the advent of the digital age, some people argue that libraries have lost their relevance. I strongly disagree with this viewpoint. In my opinion, libraries are just as important today as they were before the digital age.  Firstly, libraries provide a quiet and peaceful environment for studying and research. In today's world, where distractions are plenty, it's hard to find a place where you can focus without interruptions. Libraries offer a serene atmosphere that fosters concentration and learning. Additionally, libraries have trained librarians who can assist you in finding the right resources and information, something that the internet cannot always provide accurately.  Secondly, libraries offer a vast array of resources that are not available online. Many books, especially rare and old ones, are not digitized and can only be found in libraries. Moreover, libraries often subscribe to academic databases and journals that are not accessible to the general public. These resources are invaluable for researchers, students, and scholars who need access to authentic and reliable information.  Thirdly, libraries play a vital role in promoting literacy and education. They offer free access to books, magazines, and other reading materials that people may not be able to afford otherwise. This is particularly important for children and young adults who need to develop their reading skills. Libraries also organize various events and programs that promote reading and learning, such as book clubs, author talks, and workshops.  Furthermore, libraries are an integral part of the community. They provide a safe and welcoming space for people to come together, share ideas, and learn from each other. Libraries often host community events, such as book fairs, cultural festivals, and art exhibitions, that promote social cohesion and diversity.  In conclusion, libraries are just as important in the digital age as they were before. They provide a unique environment that fosters learning, offers access to resources that are not available online, promotes literacy and education, and serves as a hub for community engagement. While the internet has certainly changed the way we access information, it cannot replace the invaluable role that libraries play in our society.  In my opinion, the continued importance of libraries is undeniable. They are not just repositories of knowledge but vibrant centers of learning and community engagement. Even in the digital age, libraries continue to be relevant and play a vital role in shaping the minds of future generations.		1
We all hide our emotions at one point or another but, what if we had the technology that could detect whatever were feeling despite if were trying to hold them in or not. The Facial Action Coding System or FACS is just that piece of technolgy that is capable of detecting any given emotion. Dr. Huang inventor of this software has even modified it to were it can find out any emotion or emotions all at once. It's been questioned should this kind of technolgy be used in classrooms for students. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students in the classroom because, if any student is having troubles on the actvity at hand the Facial Action Coding System could detect that modify the prompt and make it easier for the student to then understand. Second, this software could help you better understand someone and their well-being being able to see exactly what's making them happy and what's making them upset. Third, it's better way for human and computers to "communicate or interact".  Anybody couldn't say that they haven't had problems understanding something at any given point in time. Simpily because, everyone can't understand everything right away with no problem/obstacle getting in the way weither it being how the words are phrased or if the vocabulary is too hard to comprehend. FACS could solve this issue right away. As presented in the passage "Dr. Huang predicts, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor," therefore making it easier for the student or user to understand what is being asked or written. Solving probems much quicker than the instrustor could explaining the information piece by piece.  Understanding emotions when communicating with someone is key. Yet, we might not recognize all that are being distrubed to us. Another great reason for FACS to come into play. As stated in the passage "you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc." This is all very true we can't comprehend every emotion that's more dull or hidden. So why don't we get a little help at recognizing more emotions. With FACS we can better understand someones true feelings inside and their well-being. This can than lead to possibly help solving some of the persons unsolved issues and other "troubling thoughts." Helping them become of the better verison of themselves.  In our generation today technolgy is something that we live and breath. It's important that we become familair with technolgy and being able to use it properly and effectifly. "Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate." Now isn't this perfect? Huang can help us better understand computers and help computers better understand us. If students will be using computers 24/7 why not have the proper setup for them. If the software gets used in the way it's meant to it can overall have a positive effect towards the situation. After some time the computer can develop how the student or user works and operates and what they can understand and can not. Having a large postitive impact. Greater increasing the student's grades, confidence, and potentional in class. Allowing them to fully understand the content be covered better than they would ever before.  In conculsion, the Facial Action Coding System or FACS is valuable in the students classroom because, it can modify the content of the information to be better understood. Being able to see and recognize more emotions for peers. Lastly it can help the user better "communicate" with the computer. 		0
 The topic of whether or not the electoral college works has been a widely discussed issue for decades. There are arguments both in favor and against the system. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument and try to provide a balanced analysis.  On the one hand, supporters of the electoral college argue that it is a fair and representative system. They believe that the system allows every state to have an equal say in the selection of the president, regardless of its population size. This is important because the country is made up of many different states with diverse populations, interests, and priorities. A system that gives all states an equal say in the selection of the president ensures that the president will be chosen by representative of the entire country, not just urban or densely populated areas.  Additionally, some argue that the electoral college prevents a candidate from winning the presidency by winning in just a few large cities along the coast. The electoral college system requires a candidate to win in some rural and swing states as well, which means that they must appeal to a wider range of voters and issues.  On the other hand, opponents of the electoral college argue that it is a system that is skewed against smaller and less populous states. They argue that because larger states have more electoral votes, candidates are more likely to spend time and resources campaigning in those states, while ignoring smaller states. This creates an imbalance in the system and can ignore the interests and concerns of smaller, less populous states.  Furthermore, some argue that the electoral college can lead to a candidate winning the popular vote, but losing the election. In the 2000 presidential election, for example, Al Gore won the popular vote, but lost the election because he did not win enough electoral votes in Florida.  In conclusion, the electoral college system has its advantages and disadvantages. While it ensures that all states have an equal say in the selection of the president, it can also be skewed against smaller and less populous states. Ultimately, whether or not the electoral college works will depend on a variety of factors and how it is used by candidates and voters.		1
Dear Florida State Senator,  The Electoral College is an unamerican, and unfair voting process. In America we believe in the people living in our country having the right to vote for their leaders, but what if they're not directly voting themselves? The electoral college is an inacurrate way of determining the leaders of our country compared to the other actually accurate way of voting, a direct vote election. The method of The Electoral College cannot always be controlled by the voters from their state, and is unfair to states with lower populations whereas the population of that state might not understand what exactly they're voting for. This doesn't seem exactly the way things are supposed to be in our nation since "...over 60 perecnt of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."(source 2), does it?  Though it is highly unlikely that a choosen elector from a state would not vote towards the chosen side their state decided and voted upon, they still have the opportunity to. This opporitunity is unfair to the voters of the state as they are not directly voting for the president, such as how things are in a direct vote. A direct vote allows the candidate to be choosen and voted for directly by voters knowladgebly voting, then the highest popularity perecentage from votes are then to have the candidate be elected, not by a group of people that have a chance to be bias from the voters in their state. This problem can occur by things such as state legislatures picking electors that may not vote in favor of the states population's choice, but their and state legislatures choice. Even though "...almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis,.."(source 3) not all states electors must do so. They can and have the chance to choose whoever they want as the power to pick is in their hands, and out of ours.  In smaller states such as Hawaii and Alaska they are only given a total of 3-4 electoral college votes as their population is not as large as somewhere such as California, New York or Florida. This does not only matter due to the low number of votes awarded, but it also effects how much they may know about the candidates running for the position. A lot of candidates only choose to go to "swing" states (California, New York, etc.) in order to recieve more votes in the electoral college. "...candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning,.."(source 2) this causes a lot of people in areas not visited to be unknowledgable about eligible candidates in the voting process, and what they could be voting for. These "swing" states help candidates reach their goal of the winning 270 majority votes out of the 538 possible. 538 may seem like a large number but compared to the population of the United States its not really all that large of a group of people. The population of our nation and the votes of our voters is much more larger then the decisions of 538 electors.  Now hopefully it is clearer to see the many problems of the current electoral college system, as it is unfair and irrational. Our nation's voters are the ones who should be voting in a direct vote in picking the president compared to the electoral college. As the method of the electoral college cannot always be controlled by the voters from their state, and is unfair to states with lower populations whereas the population of that state might not understand what exactly they're voting for. These are only a couple of the large problems caused by the electoral college. As far as these problems I believe as Bob Dole said: Abolish the electoral college!  Sincerely,  Anonymous Student    		0
Imagine getting told you are required to do a summer project for school but you have to come up with the whole project by yourself. Some schools require students to do summer projects to make sure they keep learning all summer. Some schools would also like to know if the projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Although it would be easier on students, the projects should be teacher-designed. Schools that require students to do summer projects should be teacher designed because there would be less stress for students, the projects would be easier to grade, and it would most likely be less work for teachers throughout the summer.  Teacher-designed projects would have less stress on the students. If the students had to come up with the project there would most likely be a lot¬†of missing projects. Most high school¬†students have jobs and sports in the summer which would make having a summer project hard. Jobs and school is hard at the same time so having a teacher at least¬†give you and idea would take stress away. Students having to come up with the project would also be a lot¬†harder for the teacher to grade.  Teacher-designed projects would also be easier to grade. If the teacher has the idea already ready for the student then she knows what to expect. She would also know the requirements and it would be easier to give a grade. Grading is very time consuming so things to make that easier for them is probably appreciated. The teacher knowing what kind of projects she will have to grade when school starts again will be a lot¬†less stressful for her when grading starts.  Teacher-designed projects would also be a lot¬†less work for the teacher. Yes, the teachers have to come up with a lot¬†of different ideas for the students. However, it will be a lot¬†less work throughout the summer. Some students might have a lot¬†of questions about how to do the project or ask for help. To the teacher that might be frustrating in her break from school. Teachers like there school break just as much as students.  If it was up to me the summer projects should be teacher-designed. The teachers probably wont like that idea very much because its a little extra work but it would be a lot¬†less stressful. Teacher designed projects would be easier because there is less stress for students, teachers would have an easier time grading them, and the teachers would have less work throughout the summer.		0
During the summer many students tend to loose the skills and information they gather through the previous school year. Some higher level courses to prevent this problem, implement¬†summer reading activities or online module/guided programs to keep their students on top of the material or to refresh them... but with all schools come different teaching styles. Some teachers strive for their students to be more independent and do the work on their own, but other teachers like to have a rigorous and set rubric or outline of what projects and essays should look like. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it eliminates the loopholes that can be found by the students, the teacher can incorporate the summer project into a future theme or unit in the school year, and if students designed a project for themselves they wouldn't challenge themselves and put minimal effort in.  Students when they are given freedom or multiple options tend to tweak and stretch the guidelines to make it easier or to even make excuses on why they didn't do a certain part or do it a certain way. If teachers have full control over the design of this summer based assignment they can insure the students will do what they say exactly and theres no if's, and's, or but's about it. Also when the teacher has full control over the summer assignments design it is easier for them to fi the project's theme into the curriculum or unit they desire during the school year. With my AP English teacher this year, 11th grade, I had summer reading to do and an assignment she attached with it. This book ended up tying into other books we discussed in class and fit into the curriculum very well. This shows how it benefits the teachers a lot with workload, and even students, because the assignment actually means something and isn't just a bogus last minute project they could make up and waste their time.  The last example of why a teacher-designed project is beneficial to the students is that it doesn't sell the kids short of their academic potential by just taking the easy way out with an easy project. Students, or anyone, only grow and develop when they're exposed to challenges and obstacles it builds their mental capacity and their problem solving skills. If a teacher choices to do a particularly hard project or assignment this pushes the students out of their comfort zone allowing them to make these new connections in their brain and gain new knowledge and working skills. But if a kid is allowed to design their own project for the summer, most kids aren't going to do an extravagant or hard project, but instead take a more simplistic and easier way because the students want to enjoy their summer and not waste it on a school project. This would be a detriment to the students academics and the skills they could've acquired if they were to apply themselves.  The opposing idea of a student-designed project can be argued to be beneficial to the students for maybe 2 ways, it allows the student to be more creative and if they can design something they like... they will be more motivated to complete the task. Though these are both good ideas. They don't hold as many pros as the teacher-designed project does. Teachers often add a lot of creativity to their projects and even have a rubric section for maybe 5-10 points just for creativity and colorfulness itself. Teachers also often allow kids to atleast pick the topic of the project or what they want to research to encourage them to do something they like, but still hold the same guidelines for the attatched project.  Though sometimes these projects the teachers provide seem tedious, pointless, and "too much" the teachers are usually doing it for the students own good and want to see them grow as a student. These teacher-designed assignments allow them to help students through the school year, guide them through lessons, and develop them as a student.¬†		0
 A cowboy who rode the waves refers to a surfer, a person who slides down sandy coasts on waves using specialized equipment. Surfing has a long history, but its popularity increased in the mid-20th century with the development of surfboard design, wetsuits, and other equipment, which allowed surfers to brave the ocean's waves even in cooler temperatures. In addition to its athletic aspects, surfing has also become a popular hobby and pastime for people of all ages and backgrounds.  The roots of surfing can be traced back to ancient Polynesian cultures, where people rode waves on wooden boards to catch fish for food. However, surfing did not become widely popular in the Western world until the late 19th century, when Hawaiian surfers introduced the sport to visitors on the islands. The popularity of surfing continued to grow in the early 20th century, with the first surfing contests being held in California and Hawaii.  The surfing culture of the 1960s played a significant role in the rise of surfing in the United States and throughout the world. The hippie movement of the time encouraged a free-spirited, countercultural lifestyle that included the pursuit of surfing. Surfing became associated with the ideal of freedom, with surfers riding the waves as if they were the cowboys of the sea.  Surfing has continued to be a popular pastime in recent years, with many people around the world taking up the sport as a hobby or a form of exercise. Surfing is a physically challenging activity that requires strength, agility, and balance, but it is also a lot of fun and can provide a sense of adventure and freedom for people of all ages.  In conclusion, a cowboy who rode the waves refers to a surfer, a person who rides the ocean's waves on a surfboard. Surfing has a rich history, and its popularity grew rapidly in the mid-20th century with the development of specialized equipment and the surfing culture of that era. Surfing continues to be a popular hobby and pastime for people of all ages and backgrounds, providing a fun and challenging way to experience the beauty and power of the ocean.		1
Dear Senator Don Gates, There has been many arguments about whether or not to keep the electoral college or to change the election process by popular vote. The best way to go would be to use popular vote. The Electoral College is "unfair, outdated, and irrational." Plumer, paragraph 14. There are so many reasons as to why you should change to popular vote, When you vote for your candidate, you're actually voting for your candidates electors, sometimes the state legislatures pick the electors, and also its an unfair process to voters. The Electoral College needs to be booted out!  When you go to vote, you think that you are directly voting for your candidates, that is no the case. You are actually voting for your candidates electors. You cannot control who your electors vote for either. They do not always vote for the same person you want them to. Voters may sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. This has happened. If the process were done by popular vote then their wouldnt be these problems taking place.  Who picks the electors? Sometimes it is the State legislatures. They are responsible. In the article "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong" , it states that in 1960, segregationists almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new ones that would then oppose John F. Kennedy. This was so a popular vote would not go to Kennedy. Also it was stated that "faithless" electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please. This doesn seem fair to the people.  The whole process of the Electoral College is "unfair to voters". There is a reason behind this accusation. The winnertakeall system to be more precise. Candidates dont spend time in states that they know they have not a slight chance of winning, they tend to focus more on the "swing" states. During a campaign in 2000, seventeen states didnt get to see candidates at all. Voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. As it was stated in the article "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong", "If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it...".  The Electoral College is not the best way to decide who runs our military, or nation. We need a way to have a fair and equal vote. Popular vote is the way. Though the electoral college is a quick and easier way to get votes in, it isnt very efficient. The process isnt fair to the people at all, you're not directly voting for the candidate of your choice, and state legislatures, who have opinions, pick the elctors.		0
Hey there,  I remember the time when I first learned how to play the guitar. It was during my summer vacation, and I was determined to master it. I practiced for hours every day, my fingers sore and my mind focused on the chords and strumming patterns. It wasn't easy, but with persistence and dedication, I finally got it! It was an incredible feeling, knowing that I had accomplished something I never thought I could do.  Mastering something can be a game-changer. It boosts your confidence and makes you feel more capable of tackling new challenges. When I started learning how to play the guitar, I thought it was just a fun hobby, but it actually helped me in other areas of my life. For instance, it taught me the importance of perseverance and hard work, which I can apply to my schoolwork and other areas of my life.  But here's the thing  ?once you've mastered something, it's easy to get complacent and stop learning. I mean, I already know how to play the guitar, so why bother practicing anymore? But that's not the way to go. Continuous learning and growth are crucial for personal and professional development.  One way to continue learning is by exploring new areas of interest. For example, I've always been interested in music production, so I started learning how to use music software and producing my own beats. It's been a fun and rewarding experience, and it's helped me see the music-making process from a different perspective.  Another way to continue learning is by seeking out new challenges. For instance, I've started playing in a band with some friends, and it's pushed me to improve my skills and learn new techniques. It's also helped me develop my sense of rhythm and timing, which is essential for playing with a group.  I've also seen many examples of people who continue to learn and grow even after they've mastered something. For instance, professional athletes often work with coaches and trainers to improve their skills and stay ahead of the competition. Similarly, successful businesspeople are always looking for new ways to innovate and stay ahead of the curve.  In conclusion, mastering something can be a powerful tool for personal		1
Dear Principal,  I am writing to you today to express my opinion about requiring all students to perform community service. I believe that all students should be required to perform some type of community service.  I think this because I have seen how community service has positively impacted some of my friends. For example, my friend Emily tutors elementary school children every Saturday. Through her community service, she has learned how to work with children and develop better communication skills. These skills have not only helped her in her community service projects but also in other aspects of her life.  Another one of my friends, Jack, cleans up litter in our local neighborhood every week. He has noticed a significant improvement in the cleanliness of our community since he started cleaning up the area. Jack has also learned the importance of taking care of our environment and keeping our community clean.  I understand that other students may think community service takes up too much of their time. However, I believe that the benefits of community service far outweigh those concerns. Not only does it help improve our community, it also develops our personal growth, communication skills, and sense of responsibility.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that community service should be required for all students. The positive impact it has on our own personal growth as well as our community makes it a valuable experience for students. I hope you take these examples into consideration when making your decision.  Sincerely,  [Your name]		1
Failure is a concept that has been discussed and debated for centuries. It is often seen as a negative experience that can lead to discouragement and defeat. However, many successful individuals have achieved their goals without experiencing failure. In this essay, I will research the concept of failure in the pursuit of success, outline the key points that support the idea of achieving success without failure, make a list of examples that demonstrate successful pursuit without failure, and create an essay that reinforces the idea of success without failure.  Firstly, it is important to understand the definition of failure. Failure is the inability to achieve a desired goal or outcome. It is often seen as a negative experience that can lead to discouragement and defeat. However, failure is not always a negative experience. In fact, it can be a valuable learning opportunity that can help individuals grow and develop.  Secondly, many successful individuals have achieved their goals without experiencing failure. For example, Thomas Edison is known for his many failures, but he also had many successes. He famously said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." This shows that failure is a natural part of the process of achieving success. It is important to view failure as a stepping stone towards achieving success.  Thirdly, there are many examples of successful pursuit without failure. For example, Oprah Winfrey started her career as a news anchor and faced many rejections before becoming a successful talk show host. She used these failures as motivation to continue pursuing her dreams and eventually became one of the most successful media personalities in history.  In conclusion, the pursuit of success is not always a straight path. Failure is a natural part of the process, and it can be a valuable learning opportunity. Many successful individuals have achieved their goals without experiencing failure. It is important to view failure as a stepping stone towards achieving success. Examples of successful pursuit without failure, such as Thomas Edison and Oprah Winfrey, demonstrate the importance of perseverance and determination in achieving success.		1
While driverless cars present potential benefits, developing this new technology also poses risks that require serious consideration. According to the article, autonomous vehicles could reduce car accidents, traffic jams, and carbon emissions by taking human error out of driving. However, the technology remains untested on a wide scale and may introduce new safety and privacy concerns.    Promising as their advantages seem, fully autonomous cars are not yet proven to perform flawlessly in all traffic conditions. The article notes computers could have difficulty handling unique situations like construction zones or dealing with aggressive drivers. Without sufficient real-world testing, developers may overlook scenarios that could lead to accidents. Additionally, people may develop overreliance on the technology and reduce their own attention on the road. Some view driverless cars as a chance to be distracted or even sleep behind the wheel. But vehicles may occasionally require human control, so passengers must stay alert.  Privacy is another potential downside. For autonomous cars to sense their surroundings and coordinate, they will likely rely on cameras, sensors and data transmission. But the article does not make clear how developers would protect information gathered from inside vehicles and their movements. Without tough regulations and oversight, private data could be vulnerable to hackers or governmental overreach. People may grow uneasy knowing their every ride could be tracked and recorded.    In conclusion, while driverless cars offer promising benefits of reducing accidents and emissions, their technology has not been proven at scale and could introduce new safety and privacy risks if rushed to market prematurely. More testing is needed to ensure autonomous vehicles can handle a wide range of scenarios before widespread adoption. Developers and regulators must also address legitimate concerns about data privacy and security. With further research and safeguards, autonomous vehicles may eventually transform transportation. But developing them responsibly should be a higher priority than meeting arbitrary timelines.		1
 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a system that uses a comprehensive measurement system to identify basic motor actions that occur on the face. Developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in the 1970s, FACS is used in various scientific and practical fields, including forensic science, psychology, and advertising.  FACS considers facial movements as a means of communication, providing insights into people's emotions, intentions, and attitudes. The system identifies six basic facial movements or actions that can occur on the face, including smiling, frowning, raising eyebrows, squinting, wrinkling the nose, and opening the mouth.  Each of these facial actions is coded on a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being the smallest movement and 7 being the most significant. By combining these codes, the system can identify over 40,000 facial expressions, providing a comprehensive method for understanding human emotions and behaviors.  FACS plays a vital role in forensic science, particularly in the field of facial identification. By using FACS, forensic experts can analyze digital images or footage of a crime scene, identifying individuals based on their facial expressions and movements. This technique has been used successfully in numerous cases, including the identification of Osama bin Laden from a 2002 video.  In psychology, FACS is used to study human emotions and behaviors, providing insights into how individuals express themselves through facial movements. Researchers have used FACS to examine the relationship between facial expressions and emotions, as well as the role of facial expressions in social interactions and communication.  FACS has also been used in advertising and marketing, allowing companies to better understand their customers' needs and desires. By analyzing facial expressions and movements, advertisers can create more effective marketing campaigns that appeal to their target audience.  In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a powerful tool for understanding human emotions, behaviors, and communication. With its comprehensive measurement system, FACS provides insights into the vast world of facial expressions and movements. Whether in forensic science, psychology, or advertising, FACS plays a vital role in understanding the complexities of human behavior.		1
Do you ever wish you could stay in your warm, cozy bed to learn? Being in the comfort of my own home would definitely make me want to learn more. Most of the time I do not want to deal with the people at school and it even stresses me out. That stress interferes with my learning abilities; therefore, learning at home would be the best choice for me. Although many people say distance learning for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferences is not beneficial, in reality learning from home is more beneficial because you are in the comfort of your own home, there are no distractions, and if you are absent, it is easier to get caught up.  There are many different factors on why learning from home is beneficial, for example, being in the comfort of your own home. I know many students who accumulate stress when interacting with people at school and would rather learn from home where they are most comfortable. Most of the time when I am at school, many different things stress me out. For example, I hardly ever raise my hand to answer a question because I have that fear of what if I get it wrong , then the whole class will laugh. If I was at home, where I am the most comfortable, I would not have that problem and there would not be other students that can judge me.  Another benefit by learning from home is that there are no distractions. There are probably hundred of distractions in a classroom, not even including the thousand distractions throughout the whole school. The distractions that distract me at school include: other students talking, someone making a funny noise and the whole class being off task, and now I even fear of a school shooter. A method that helps me is going into a smaller class for my Study Hall. I go into a smaller classroom, called Math Lab, to work on my math homework and ask questions. Sometimes I do not have math homework, but I still go because the smaller, more quiet environment is beneficial when getting work done. Math Lab is like my home and it benefits me because of the one on one helping and the little to no distractions in the room. When thinking about all these distractions puts a stop on your learning; however, when you are at home there are definitely less distractions and you feel safe.  Lastly, if you are absent a lot of the time, it is easier to get caught up and you do not have to worry about being behind. I know that in high school probably 75% of students are student athletes. This includes them going out of town to play their sport and them having to miss a couple days of school. That has been my life for the past 12 years because of my competitive cheer¬†I do outside of school. When you are a competitive cheerleader you are required to compete at all the competitions, including the ones out of state. When I go out of state for a competition, I always have to miss at least two days of school. In high school there is not one day you do not learn something new, so missing two days is a big deal and puts me behind. By learning online I would not have that problem because when I am out of state I can still learn from the hotel and never be behind on learning.  Others might say learning from home is not beneficial because physical human interaction with different teachers and students help a child learn more. That is not the case because in high school you strictly only learn. You walk into the classroom to sit down and not talk for 90 minutes. You hardly ever interact with the students around you because you are forced to learn. If you were learning from home that is exactly how it would be, but better because of the beneficial factors. The only difference is that there is a one centimeter screen between the teacher and student.  Would you rather be comfortable when learning with no distractions, stress, and fears? Well that is how learning from home by way of online or video conference would be like. Different factors from being at school pours into your learning abilities. You first start out your day with the struggle to wake up and leave the house because you are dreading to go to school. Then, when you get to school you have to sit in a hard, plastic chair for 90 minutes, while being distracted by your fellow classmates. Already half way through class you have the fear of missing an important part of the lesson because of all the distractions. Now, you have built up stress and there is no way of learning when you constantly have stress. Imagine having stress seven hours a day, five times a week for the nine months you are in school. Are you even comprehending anything you have learned throughout the school year then? Therefore, learning from home is the best route to go and will save many students from over thinking¬†and accumulating stress.¬†		0
Would students learn more at home rather than at school? This is a highly debated question in the educational world as many schools are considering adopting "distance learning" for their students. Some students who are sick or injured may benefit from a home environment. However, the majority would struggle due to distractions, distance between student and teacher, and the lack of an authoritative figure to keep them on task.  Many students are easily distracted in school, so in a room full of things much more interesting than classwork, there is an even greater chance for distraction. Along with this, for those students who's parents work outside of the home, there is no one to help keep them on task. That is a lot to ask for a young adolescent with distractions such as video games, pets, etc. Throughout the development of my education, I have discovered staying focused and on track to be one of the most difficult things to do, especially while in one's own room. Therefore, the addition of distance learning would create an epidemic of kids who are unfocused, adding to the already skyrocketing amount. In the past 10 to 20 years the quantity of kids and teenagers claiming or being diagnosed with ADD and ADHD has reached unprecedented heights. Adding these students or others to a home environment with toys, games, and a bed is just asking for problems.  One main issue with learning from home is the absence of the teacher. For, the only way for the teacher to reach his or her student would be through a computer screen. Video calls are a very useful piece of technology; however, from a teaching standpoint, they provide very little gratification, nor do they achieve the same goals compared to a face to face encounter. Depending on the time of classes and calls, the teacher and student may not always be available at the same time. This would expand the distance between the student and the teacher. Such a gap can cause a student to feel stranded in an ocean of equations, since there is no teacher to help save him or her. While most teachers hate to believe it, most students cheat. And in a room all by themselves, with internet access, there is no doubt many would cheat on tests and quizzes with ease. From personal experience, it is way to easy to find a classwork or homework assignment on a pdf document through Google.  Shying away from the learning portion of the debate, a school is a cultural hub where long lasting lessons and friendships are made. While many students feel they could go the rest of their lives without stepping foot in school again, the loss of such an important place would leave students with a weaker connection to friends and a poor social development. The lessons learned in school, don't always happen in the classroom; they can occur in the halls, the gym, or even the locker room. These lessons become part of who we are and how we continue to grow as students and humans.  Now, of course there are benefits to learning at home. A great portion of students today are sleep¬†deprived and also through personal experience, the lack of sleep greatly affects student's grades. So, with the idea of learning from home, many kids may be able to sleep in and gain some much needed rest. This alone could boost grades for lots of students. However, there is no guarantee students will obtain an increase in sleep through the change. As the amount of sleep a student gets, directly correlates to the amount of homework that is assigned. In other words, without a decrease in the amount of homework assigned, there will continue to be tired students who fall asleep during class and struggle to stay awake during long, boring lectures.  Overall, the incorporation of a distance learning option for students is not a good idea. With students who are still tired, cheating, and struggling to stay focused there seems to be little to no gain from the plan. However, an experiment could be done with a few schools to determine the true effectiveness of the program. But, until then the evidence and the conclusion is against the addition of long distance learning.¬†		0
 The electoral college is a system used in the United States to elect the president of the country. The system is made up of a group of electors who are chosen by the states to vote for a candidate. The total number of electors is equal to the sum of the number of senators and representatives each state has in Congress.  One of the main arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it gives each individual state an equal say in the election process. This means that smaller states have the same amount of influence as larger states, and that the president cannot win the election simply by winning in densely populated urban areas. In this way, the electoral college helps to ensure that candidates focus on winning the support of voters in states across the country, rather than simply concentrating on winning in a few key states.  However, one of the main arguments against the electoral college is that it can lead to a candidate winning the popular vote, but losing the election. This can happen if a candidate performs well in states with a large population, but poorly in states with a smaller population. For example, in the 2000 presidential election, Al Gore won the popular vote, but lost the electoral college vote and the election. This can be seen as a problem because it means that the candidate who receives the most votes overall may not necessarily become the president of the country.  Another argument against the electoral college is that it can lead to candidates focusing on winning in certain states at the expense of others. For example, in the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama won the election by winning in key swing states, but he lost several states that were expected to vote for him, including Georgia and Virginia. This can be seen as a problem because it means that candidates may be more focused on winning key swing states than on issues that are important to voters in other states.  In conclusion, the electoral college is a system used in the United States to elect the president of the country. The main arguments in favor of the system are that it gives each individual state an equal say in the election process and helps to ensure that candidates focus on winning the support of voters in states across the country. The main arguments against the system are that it can lead to a candidate winning the popular vote, but losing the election, and can lead to candidates focusing on winning in certain states at the expense of others. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the electoral college can depend on how well it works in practice, and how much it contributes to ensuring that the president is elected by the people.		1
In today's society, cars are seen as a necessity. We rely on them to get to work, school, and the grocery store. But what if we could live without cars?  There are many advantages to limiting car usage. For one, it would help reduce air pollution. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. By driving less, we can help to make the air cleaner and healthier for everyone.  Limiting car usage would also improve public health. Studies have shown that people who walk or bike to work have lower rates of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. When we get around on foot or by bike, we get more exercise and fresh air.  Limiting car usage would also save money. Cars are expensive to buy, maintain, and insure. If we drove less, we would save money on gas, parking, and car repairs. We could use that money to spend on other things, like travel or entertainment.  Finally, limiting car usage would make our cities more livable. When there are fewer cars on the road, it's easier to walk, bike, and take public transportation. This can make our cities more pedestrian-friendly and less congested.  Of course, there are some challenges to limiting car usage. One challenge is that it can be inconvenient. If we don't have a car, we may have to rely on public transportation or ride-sharing services. This can be time-consuming and expensive.  Another challenge is that limiting car usage can be difficult for people who live in rural areas. Public transportation is often not available in rural areas, and it can be difficult to get around without a car.  Despite these challenges, I believe that the advantages of limiting car usage outweigh the disadvantages. If we want to create a healthier, more sustainable future, we need to find ways to reduce our reliance on cars.  There are many things that we can do to limit car usage. We can choose to live closer to work or school. We can walk, bike, or take public transportation when possible. We can also carpool or rideshare.  If we all make an effort to limit car usage, we can make a big difference. We can improve our air quality, our health, and our economy. We can also make our cities more livable. So let's put away the keys and get moving!		1
Humanity believes this land structure is a face left by aliens, we will never know.  We have to find out and learn.  People have questions about this "face" on the moon, what does this mean, what next, how did this happen.  That will remain a mystery.  We have seen strange objects in the sky, strange "ships" and UFO's and what not.  But we have never had any proof that aliens exist.  we have never seen one, captured one or anything.  But we also have never seen them in space.  These mysterious objects on the moon are just a coincedince.  Until we have proof that we have captured, seen, or caught on camera a extraterestrial thing we cannot say this object was made by aliens.  This land structure could be a manmade structure and we would never know it.  We would never know if othe people made a trip to the moon.  Till we have proof this was not a human manmade structure, it will be a mystery till it is prooved.  There ar thousands of craters, dents and all kinds of odd looking things on the moon, what makes you think this could be made by someone or something.  It will remain a mystery till we know who or what did it.		0
When making an important decision, it's inparative to pick the better choice. How can one do this? By asking for advise, of course! Asking for advise, whether it be on something small or something very crucial, has not yet failed to deliver better and more detailed results. By asking for help, you can examine different mindsets, gain more knowledge on a topic, and possibly even learn about somebody's past experiences. Most of the time, all you have to do is to ask for assistance.  Everyone is different. Their choices are their own. More importantly, why they do what they do is different for each person. They might even share what they'd have done if they were in the same boat. Getting a different perspective can help you make the proper choice for you. No matter the form that it comes in, getting different points of view can help bring clarity into your thought process.  You wouldn't ask a barber to do a butcher's job, so don't ask the same of yourself. If there is somebody with more knowledge about the topic or has been in a similar situation before, you shouldn't hesitate to ask. Most likely, it's a question they've been asked timeless times before. Getting an expert's opinion on the situation may seem scary but the majority of people would love to share their thoughts and knowledge to every person they can.  Ever told somebody that they shouldn't do something that you just did? Well then, by giving advise to an unexpecting person, you might've just saved them. Asking people about their past experiences can mean the difference between succeeding and being another failure. Whether it be about calling somebody or eating terrible food, giving and receiving advisecan save somebody's bacon, especially if it was taught from personal experience.  Rulers have advisors for a reason.  Seeking multiple opinions on certain subjects can help a person determine the correct path for them and those affected by that decision. Getting different points of views, more information, and reviews about others' past experiences can greatly affect somebody's decision making process. Making an important decision can be stressful, but there are always going to be people willing to give free advise.¬†		0
I do not agree with this technolgy to read students expressions because its like forcing them to show their real emotion when they don't want to talk about or even show if they're sad or happy. Some student's come to school to help use get through with our emotion's through friends that they trust so if you bring that machine to a classroom and point out the person that is sad is clearly none of your busniess unless they wanna talk to you about it. This example "these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful" how can you tell if someone is being truthful through emotions? We all express our emotions differently, so differently that computers can't tell the difference. I think that the technology is useless and they should use their time to cure sicknesses or to help people besides telling their emotions through a computer. Instead of using their knowledge to make a computer telling the difference between emotion's they should put it into a good use like a cure to all sickness. I'm not calling them dumb or anything like that i'm just saying instead of investing their time and money on a computer they should invest their time to actually helping people.		0
 People often find themselves at a crossroads in life, trying to decide whether to follow their own decisions or seek guidance from experts and authorities. While there are certainly benefits to seeking guidance, relying on others too much can make you less self-sufficient and hinder your personal growth. In this essay, I will argue that people should make their own decisions and develop their own self-identity, rather than relying on the choices of others.  Firstly, relying on others can make you less self-sufficient. When you constantly rely on others to make decisions for you, you are not developing your own problem-solving skills or learning how to navigate life on your own. This can be especially problematic in situations where you are unable to access external help, such as in an emergency. Additionally, relying too heavily on others can make you feel like you are not in control of your own life, which can be demotivating and lead to feelings of helplessness.  Secondly, people who spend their whole life heavily relying on others develop no self-identity of their own. When you rely on others to define who you are, you are not developing your own unique perspective or values. This can make it difficult for others to truly understand you and can also make it harder for you to make decisions that align with your own beliefs. Furthermore, relying on others to define your identity can make you vulnerable to the opinions and expectations of others, which can be limiting and stifling.  Lastly, always becoming a person who does not have to rely on others for the sake of your own well-being can be detrimental to your overall happiness and success. While it is important to be self-sufficient, it is also important to recognize that you cannot do everything on your own. Seeking guidance and support from others can be a valuable resource, especially in situations where you are unsure or uncertain. Additionally, relying too heavily on yourself can lead to burnout and exhaustion, which can negatively impact your mental and physical health.  In conclusion, while seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be beneficial, relying too heavily on others can make you less self-sufficient and hinder your personal growth. People should strive to make their own decisions and develop their own self-identity, rather than relying on the choices of others. By doing so, they can become more confident,		1
Dear Principle,  I think that you should require all of the student body and your self perform community service. I think this because everybody should be willing to help our homes and town. This could help us. first we could get publicity and we will be good neighbors even make friends, Second we could all get active, Third it will help our environment, Last when were helping we could also be having fun.  First, if we all get out there and help I'm sure you will meet a lot of new people. Even make friends also you can make a good reputation for yourself. If we all get together and help eventually you will have tons of friends and partners in life.  Second, Every one complains about weight issues. If everyone got out there and helped work they/you will loose body fat and get muscle. So you would be helping the environment and also get a size 6 waist. Or if your a boy/man you can get the body of your dreams by getting out and helping. This will help the world and help you at getting a date.  Third, Everyone at one point wants to help animals. Well if you/we do community service you/we would be picking up trash and other things. Animals eventually eat trash and choke on it and die painfully. If we got all of the trash up then animals would be not dying for that reason. Also planting trees and flowers will help the environment, animals, and you/us by giving us oxygen and by making soil easier to grow in and by giving animals food and/or places to live.  Last, you could be cleaning out your favorite lake or pond that can be fun if you love the water. Or clean up your favorite place to play outside. I'm sure you at least have one.  In conclusion community service is a good thing it can help you, your body, the environment, and animals. That's why (principle) you should let us do community service.      		0
Driverless cars are the future. I feel that they are some of the coolest inventions since the invention of the smartphone. Just think about it, hopping into the car, telling it where to go, and not having to do anything along the way. To me, that sounds like the ultimate luxury. Lots of people feel this way, and this passage shows how driverless cars are amazing, such as increasing flexibility of the average person's day, and the ability to be entertained while being in the driver's seat of the car. I simply cannot wait until these machines become mainstream, and I will become one of the first to purchase one.  Driverless cars would increase the flexibility of the average person's day. If it was as simple as typing in where you want to go, I'm sure children would be able to operate the cars, also. This would allow the kids to get to their after-school activities easier and to school easier, too. This would widen opportunities for parents to be able to do more things everyday.  If driverless cars became truly driverless, imagine the multi-tasking opportunities that would be available in the car. Heck, I could work on homework in the driver's seat, and my dad could make business calls and paperwork while "driving." Parents could interact with their kids, and anyone and everyone could get more work done. They could also be entertained while in the car, and who doesn't like entertainment?  And last but not least, driverless cars are super cool, I mean, come on, they're DRIVERLESS cars! The concept is out of this world. I think it's totally amazing what technology can do these days, and I look forward to more inventions along the lines of these. These inventions make life easier, more fun, and a whole lot more productive, and to the best of my knowledge, these are all good things.  So, in conclusion, driverless cars are the bomb. They can make life easier, more fun, productive, and entertaining. The whole concept is spectacular, something right out of a sc-fi novel or TV show. I look forward for their breach into mainstream, where I will be waiting, waiting to purchase a driverless car.              		0
 I have always known that I wanted to be an artist. As a child, I was fascinated by the world of the performing arts and knew that I wanted to be a part of it. My family has always been supportive of my dreams, and I am grateful for their encouragement. My grandma, in particular, has always wanted to see me succeed in the world of theater. She would often take me to local performances when I was younger, and I could see the excitement in her eyes as she watched me participate in local shows every summer.  As I grew older, my love for the performing arts only grew stronger. I have always been drawn to the power of art to connect with people and evoke emotions. This is why I would like to visit the Art and Performance Center. I am particularly interested in the theater, and I believe that the center would offer me the opportunity to learn more about the art form and to develop my skills as an artist.  One of the things that draws me to the theater is the way that actors can transport their audience to another world. I am fascinated by the way that the lights, music, and dialogue can all work together to create a powerful and emotional experience. I want to be a part of that world, to create performances that can move and inspire people.  In addition to my love for the performing arts, I am also a hardworking and respectful person. I am committed to learning everything I can about the art form and to becoming the best artist I can be. I am not interested in simply playing around or acting in a boring way. I am serious about my craft, and I am excited about the opportunity to learn more about the world of theater at the Art and Performance Center.  Overall, I believe that visiting the Art and Performance Center would be a transformative experience for me as an artist. I am eager to learn more about the world of theater and to develop my skills as an actor. I am excited about the opportunity to be a part of such a prestigious and respected institution, and I am confident that I will be able to make the most of my time there.		1
Dear Principle,  I had just heard you are thinking about changing the grade to play sports to a B. I think this is not the best idea. Many students have problems at home, where projects and homework cannot be done, bringing their grade down a lot. Sports are what a lot of students depend on in school, as an after-school activity, a hobby, or even a profession. Most students are able to maintain an A or B average, but for some its just to much.  I understand that being able to play a sport is a privilege, and to earn a privilege you must do give something back. Having a C isn't bad, its average, and that's the best that some kids can do no matter how hard they try.  I think a C average is fine, and a B might be a little to much.  Another reason I don't think this is a very good idea is because for some kids being able to stay after school is a good way to meet new people and get away from whatever is happening at home that might be bothering them.  Another thing you might consider doing is, if a student doesn't get a high C, B, or higher on a test or exam they have to do something at practice, or not get as much playing time as the players that get good grades.  Thank you for your time, and I hope you choose what is best for the school.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
Many people live in the USA voting for the next president, but there are people who think that the election system need to change to become better. I personally think that the election system should stay.  First off, the founding fathers created the Electoral process. The Electoral process is a simple but complex system that holds up are government. The system protects us from people accidentaly picking a leader that may end up being a tyrent or worse. Many people may say "What about Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, or bob Dole." Well it's vary likely that there will be more people like that if we change the system and start a new.  Even though, citizens of the USA think that the Electoral Collage is Anachronism. That statement is not true. If the Electoral collage was outdated the U.S. would the government system would have fallen awhile ago. even if there may be ties between the Electoral collage the system will have a plan B. While I'm Electoral collages the representives of the state are chosen by the people if the wrong disison was made people should balm the people who chose that person.  In the end, the people are the one to blame not the system. The system may have a few flaws but the flaws are only made by the people vote. Some one may say "If the system was perfect there whould be no need for blame." but nothing can be purfect."  I think that we shouldn't change the election system    ¬†    		0
Dear Principal Smith,  I am writing to you regarding the proposal to require all students to perform community service. On the one hand, there are good arguments for making community service mandatory. Volunteering benefits society by addressing important needs, and it can teach young people valuable lessons about citizenship and helping others. However, after consideration, I do not think community service should be obligatory for all students.   Requiring community service risks taking away students' freedom to choose how to spend their free time. For some, extracurricular obligations like sports, music, or jobs are just as important for their growth and development as volunteering. Mandatory service could create resentment if students feel like their valuable personal choices are being taken away. Not all personalities and career interests are well-suited to community service either. For community service to be meaningful, participants should feel motivated from within rather than being mandated to participate.  Instead of making service compulsory, I think a better approach is to encourage it through education about opportunities and the positive impacts of volunteering. Recognizing student volunteers with awards or mention in newsletters could further inspire others to get involved. For those who want real-world experiences to strengthen college applications, requirements for a certain number of volunteer hours could be an option. However, students should not be penalized if community service does not fit their priorities or talents.    In conclusion, while I support the values of community service, I do not think it should be universally required. Students will benefit most by having the freedom to explore service and extracurricular activities that match their diverse passions and goals. Encouraging volunteerism through positive promotion, rather than mandates, will instill lifelong habits of engagement and citizenship for those who wish to participate. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue.  Sincerely, [Your name]		1
Limiting car use can be a good thing and a bad thing. In my opinion i think that people should be able to drive cars but only at certain times to limit polution. in europe as staded "while their have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs....".  in this storey you can teel that alot of these people in europe are not liking the fact that their is polution going on. "all of our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change" (paragraph 7). i can agree sort of with this because we focus on cars alot as one of our major ways of transportation. this is not a bad thing that we have cars but we need to make sure that we can keep the polution down by maybe using hybrid cars instead.  it also seems that people are starting to drive less nowadays, and in my opinion it is because either gas prices are too high or people cannot afford one."americas love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. when adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, acording to an analysis by doug short of advisor perspectives, an invesment research company as of april 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995" (paragraph 32). as you can see i was stating how the number of people driving has declined. also i believe the cause for this as i stated before is due to the number of people who can either not afford one or do not want one.  in this storey i have explained how the number of people driving cars have declined.  i have also said that europe does not really like the idea of the polution they are creating since they end up making so much smog. In my opinion maybe other countrys such as the U.S.A or canada and such should consider knocking down some of their driving privilages due to the fact that it is just too loud and not very safe as well as creating alot of polution.    		0
 The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a new technology that uses cameras and computer algorithms to analyze facial expressions and identify the six basic emotions of joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. While the FACS has been used for a variety of applications, including advertising and customer service, there are also potential uses for this technology in educational settings. In this essay, we will examine the potential benefits and drawbacks of using the FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.  On the one hand, the use of this technology could be valuable in helping teachers to monitor student engagement and emotional wellbeing. For example, the FACS could be used to detect when a student is struggling with a particular concept and identify the emotion associated with that struggle, such as frustration or confusion. This information could then be used by the teacher to tailor their instruction to better meet the needs of the student and provide additional support when necessary.  Additionally, the FACS could be used to provide real-time feedback to students on their emotional expression. For example, if a student is expressing confusion, the teacher may be able to use the FACS to indicate that their facial expression is not clearly communicating their understanding. This feedback could help students to develop more effective communication skills and improve their overall emotional regulation.  However, there are also potential drawbacks to using the FACS in a classroom setting. One concern is that the technology may be used to invade students' privacy and make them feel uncomfortable. Students may feel that they are being watched and monitored without their knowledge or consent, which could lead to feelings of distrust and discomfort.  Furthermore, the accuracy of the FACS technology is not always reliably consistent. For example, the technology may be affected by factors such as lighting and camera placement, which could lead to false readings of emotions. This could result in misinterpretation of students' true emotional state and potentially lead to misguided interventions.  In conclusion, while the Facial Action Coding System has the potential to be a valuable tool in monitoring student emotional wellbeing, it is important to carefully consider the potential privacy concerns and limitations of the technology. As with any new technology, it is important to thoughtfully evaluate its potential applications and limitations before implementing it in a classroom setting. Ultimately, teachers should prioritize creating a safe and supportive learning environment that fosters student trust and wellbeing.		1
Dear Principal,  I think that students are required to perform community service. If we don't then all of the students will focus more about themselves then others. A simple task, like picking up trash around the neighborhood, if not done then our streets will clog up the streets and it would be hard to get around from one place to another. Another example is tutor little kids with their work. If they don't get help then there is a slight chance that they will not get to higher grade levels. There is also some more consequences for not doing community service. Also I think we should offer some rewards like stickers or pencils. There are some people out in the community that need are help and we shouldn't just ignore it.  Some people even do community service, but they don't do their share of it. They just basically do some of the work then just leave to do other things they want to do. I think we should put consequences for the students that bail out of the service their doing. Some ideas for consequences should be more homework, stay after school for a little while, or put community service as a grade. If we do that then students understand why community service is important. So in conclusion, I think we should require all students to perform community service.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
"Social media has become an integral part of our lives, but it's a debatable topic whether it has a significant impact on societal norms and values. In my opinion, social media has a profound effect on how we perceive things and behave in society. The constant use of platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc., influences our thoughts, beliefs, and actions.  Firstly, social media promotes unrealistic beauty standards that often lead to body shaming and low self-esteem. People are constantly bombarded with edited images of models and influencers, making them feel inadequate about their own bodies. This has led to an increase in eating disorders and other mental health issues, especially among teens and young adults.  Secondly, social media also plays a significant role in spreading hate speech and cyberbullying. With anonymity being easy to achieve online, people can say whatever they want without facing any consequences. This kind of behavior not only affects the victim but also normalizes such toxic behaviors in our society.  Lastly, social media can be a great tool for activism and raising awareness about important issues. It gives a voice to the marginalized communities and helps in creating a more inclusive society. For instance, movements like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter gained momentum because of social media.  Therefore, I believe that social media does have a significant impact on societal norms and values, both positively and negatively. It's up to us how we use these platforms and what kind of content we consume and promote."		1
The idea that problems, both good and bad, can contribute to personal growth and self-development is an insightful and often overlooked concept. On the surface, many of us tend to view problems as undesirable and something to be avoided. We try to take the paths least cluttered with obstacles  ?and who could blame us? After all, who wants to put themselves through the stress and anguish of tough times that come along with hard problems? Despite this understandable instinct, problems of any kind can be used to our advantage.   Good problems are those that stretch our abilities and allow us to develop new skills. By pushing our parameters and pushing through what we may feel to be our limits, we open ourselves to a world of possibilities. These problems can lend to personal growth and self-fulfillment, and open us up to possibilities we may not have previously considered.   Similarly, bad problems can also be used as a means of learning and growing. By actively engaging challenges and putting effort towards their solutions, we learn invaluable lessons about ourselves and the world around us. We may come to trust our own resilience, or perhaps understand our position in society a bit better. Even when the immediate outcome of solving a problem is not what we had originally hoped for, the process itself can produce insight into our strategies and approaches that can be useful in furthering our personal development.   Both good and bad problems are vital to our journey of self-discovery. By embracing what may initially appear to be unpleasant tasks, challenges, or experiences, we can use these difficulties to our advantage. We can choose to see adversity as an opportunity to grow and become the best version of ourselves.		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME;  Imagine if a student has the best grades and is the most outgoing and logical student. She has just got excepted to Harvard Law school program but is unable to go because she has no community service records. Community service is very important because you are supposed to give back to your community and help out once in a while. Also it is the right thing to do because you feel good about yourself after it's over. I think all kids no matter what their grades are should perform community service because it is important for our futures. Kids have way to much free time, kids get in trouble when there not watched and its great for collage.  It is very important that kids perform community service because kids have way to much free time. Yeah there is your athletes who play five different sports but test have proven that two out of ten kids play sports. The other eight sit around and do nothing. The problem with doing nothing in this society is that kids have way to much access. Most kids have had facebook since sixth grade and get in a lot of trouble for it. Other kids sit home all day and play up to thirty hours worth of video games in one week. That is crazy because x-box and wii are not teaching you anything about the real world. Community service shows you have important it is to give back to people who have less then you do. Studies show that the worst thing that kids do after school is watch television. Most kids watch up to sixty hours worth of television each week. I highly doubt the Kardashians and Jersey Shore are teaching us the importance of helping our community.  Also kids get in trouble that is a natural thing in life kids get in trouble for fighting and cheating, but never smoking. Smoking for middle school's have gone up 20% since last year. Kids feel like they have nothing better to do in their lives so they just try a cigarette or even worse marijuana. But if kids donated more and helped out their community the number would go down dramatically from last year. Also, we are kids we make mistakes but so we don't make the same mistakes as the homeless people we need to learn how hard it is the make a living an do work, and this will teach us. I got in trouble last year for cheating on a test and instead of yelling at my mom took me to the homeless shelter and showed me how I was going to end up if I cheat and don't learn the information. I swore from that moment on that I would never cheat again, and I haven't. My mom scared me into studying and that is exactly what these kids need.  Lastly, community service looks great on a collage recommendation. My cousin didn't get into Princeton, Harvard or Yale because she didn't have a collage recommendation because community service wasn't required in her school. I know in our grade about 30% of kids aren't going to collage because they don't feel like they earned it and they don't feel good enough. That number can go down only if community service is required. Community service is not just helping clean up garbage or helping out in a soup kitchen, it could change someone's life. One of us could change a life forever but that is only if you agree to make community service mandatory in this school. I understand that kids are busy playing sports and in other activities. But that doesn't mean kids can't take one Saturday a month to help the community. I ask you TEACHER_NAME what do you think is the right choice to make?  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
The Facial Action Coding System should not be used in schools to help students. There are benefits to this system, but the bad outweigh the good. This technology used to reconize emotions will affect students in ways that aren't necessary, and cause unwanted problems in the classroom.  Firstly, the article metions this system being used on computers while students are working to analyze their emotions. The author writes " 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming comfused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'" (Alto 6). Having a computer watch students' facial expressions while working could make the students feel uncomfortable and give them anxiety. Being uncomfortable while working will effect the way a student learns. They will not be focusuing on the material they are learning, but instead the idea that they are being watched. This is a problem that's not needed in the classroom and can be avoided.  Secondly there are tons and tons of emotions a human can express. The author writes " Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS. Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles" (Alto 3). Having only classified six emotions, is not a very wide range. What if for example, a student were to show an emotion that the computer doesn't have programmed and reconizes it as somthing else, changing the lesson to fit the wrong emotion? This would cause the lesson to be changed when the student didn't need it to be. This creates a technology problem along with the problem of fixing the lesson and wasting time the student could be using to learn.  Lastly, having a computer analize a students emotions while working would leave the teacher with nothing to teach or help the students with. This might seem like a good thing at first, but teachers create the classroom atmosphere and keep students ingaged in learning. Why have a computer analyze student emotions when teachers have been doing it perfectly for years?  The Facial Action Coding System is a great advance in technology, but when it comes to schools, the System should not be used. It only creates problems that are not needed. These problems could be avoided by not using the system.		0
Many Americans today use cars to commute from one place to another, like work or going to school. However, in recent times, car usage has significantly decreased due to its beneficial effect on many communities. Based on the information given, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.  One of many advantages of limiting the usage of cars is that it can help the community. With lower car usage, the community's environment can potientally become much better. According to Source 2, France's partial driving ban caused its congestion to go "down 60 percent... after five-days of intensifying smog." This drastic change in France's car traffic prevented further pollution and smog, which hurts the community. Addtionally, limiting car usage can push more people into excercising more. In Bogota, Colombia, many Colombians "hiked, biked, skated..." during their car-free days (source 3). Also, many "parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city" (source 3). With an increase of excercise, the community's people will not only become healthier and fitter, but prevent any more damage to the community.  Futhermore, lowering car uage will benefit the community's patrons by providing a cleaner lifestyle. With limiting their car usage, the people of the community will save more money. According to Source 1, although cars aren't recommended, a car-owner may "buy a space, for $40,000, along with a home (source 1)." Normally, a decent size house is approximately $100,000 to $ 150,000 with parking as well. To add onto this, gas prices can become very expensive, especially to those to drive a lot. All this money spent on a pollution causing car can be put towards a child's education, or the community's benefit. Plus, the stress of ensuring a car's wellbeing at all times is eliminated as well, decreasing the amount of stress in citizens. Addionally, people are more happy with limited usage of cars. People like Heidrun Walter have said "I'm much happier this way (source 1)," because they feel safer and can provide more to the community. Happier people in the community leads a much cleaner, stress-free lifestyle where its inhabitants are able to thrive more.  The advantages of limiting car usage includes assisting the community and providing a cleaner lifestyle for its patrons. With a positive community, the future generation's lifes will be enhanced. The youth of a community with a great outlook on the world will provide futher citizens with another fantasic community with the potential to grow and change. However, without this, the community will not thrive nor grow.    		0
 While summer is meant to be a break from the regular school workload, having some academic activities over the summer can help students maintain their skills and knowledge. When it comes to summer projects, I believe they are best when designed by students themselves rather than being completely teacher-assigned.   Allowing students to design their own summer projects fosters independence and encourages creativity. When students have autonomy over their work, they are more invested in the learning process. They can choose topics that genuinely interest them rather than just fulfilling a teacher's requirements. This makes the work feel less like a chore and more like an opportunity for exploration. Students may pick subjects connected to their hobbies or extracurricular interests, maintaining enthusiasm for other areas of learning outside the classroom.  Furthermore, student-designed projects allow for flexibility. Every student has different strengths, weaknesses, and schedules over the summer. Some may have other commitments like summer camps, jobs, or family vacations that limit their time. By permitting students to tailor projects to their individual schedules and needs, no one feels overwhelmed or left behind. Students understand their own pacing better than teachers can from the outside.   Of course, completely unguided work risks students selecting inappropriate or low-effort topics. Therefore, there should still be guidelines and teacher approval for project ideas. Regular checkpoints also keep students accountable without being too restrictive. The role of teachers then becomes advising students and facilitating their self-directed learning, rather than strictly assigning tasks.   In conclusion, summer projects are most beneficial when designed by the students themselves within clear parameters set by teachers. This balances freedom with oversight, keeps students engaged, and treats them as autonomous learners ready to take responsibility for their education. Overall student performance and retention of knowledge is best supported through student-driven academic work over the summer break.		1
 Car-free cities are becoming more popular every year. These are cities where cars are limited or completely banned, and people are encouraged to use alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, public transportation, or electric scooters. Car-free cities have several benefits, including improved air quality, safer streets, reduced traffic congestion, and increased social and economic opportunities.  One of the main benefits of car-free cities is improved air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, releasing harmful emissions such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. By limiting or banning cars, car-free cities can reduce air pollution and improve the health of their citizens. This in turn can lead to a decrease in healthcare costs and an increase in lifespan.  Another benefit of car-free cities is safer streets. When cars are limited or banned, there are fewer accidents on the roads. This can lead to a lower number of injuries and fatalities, as well as a reduction in property damage. Furthermore, car-free cities tend to be more pedestrian-friendly, with wider sidewalks, better lighting, and more crosswalks, which can help to reduce the number of accidents caused by pedestrians and drivers alike.  Reduced traffic congestion is another key benefit of car-free cities. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, leading to long commute times, higher fuel costs, and decreased productivity. By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation, car-free cities can reduce the number of cars on the roads, leading to less congestion and more efficient transportation systems.  Finally, car-free cities can provide increased social and economic opportunities. By limiting or banning cars, car-free cities can create more space for public parks, community centers, and other public spaces. This can lead to an increased sense of community, as people gather together in these spaces to socialize and participate in community activities. Additionally, car-free cities can also create new economic opportunities, with more businesses catering to people who are not driving, such as bike repair shops, car-sharing services, and electric scooter rental companies.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer numerous benefits, including improved air quality, safer streets, reduced traffic congestion, and increased social and economic opportunities. While car-free cities are not a solution for everyone, they do provide a viable alternative for those looking to reduce their carbon footprint, improve their health, and engage with their communities in a more meaningful way. As such, car-free cities are worth considering for any city looking to build a more sustainable future.		1
They should do the program because in the program you will learn how to be a cowboy. Also you will learn how to travel the seas and survive in cold wheather. So being in the program could be fun because you will learn how to be a cowboy. Luke wants to be a segoing cowboy because he likes to travel the seas and he also likes to be a cowboy. Another reason is because he wants to have fun as a cowboy and he really wants to go travel the seas. He wants to have fun because he never has fun at his house so that is why he wants to have some fun. His house is probably boring so that is also why he wants to go outside and have some fun at the program because he wants to get out of his house and have fun. He wants to go outside and do the program so he can be a cowboy and have fun. To train to be a cowboy you have go through obstacles and overcome your fears so you can travel the seas. You also want to be able to ride the waves so you be brave and save people from your enemies. You also defenitely need to be strong so you can overcome your fears and fight bad guys so you can take them down so that is why you need to be strong. You also need to be brave so if you get put in a bad situation you will know how to get out of the bad situation so you won't get hurt while you are in the bad situation so that is why need to learn how to get out of a bad situation. You also need to learn how to stay calm in a bad situation if you do not stay calm then you will get hurt so that is why you need to learn how to stay calm in a bad situation. You need to watch out for the terrible situations in the terrible situations then you will get hurt. In the bad situations you usually will not get hurt or injured. So if you are a cowboy you need to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations because you will get hurt. So that is why you have to watch out for the bad situations and the terrible situations. So you have to at least tryout for the seagoing cowboys program because you never know what could happen at the program. You could have fun or you could get hurt or injured. So you have to watch out for that so you do not get hurt or injured. If you want to be a cowboy you have guns to protect yourself and when enemies try to shoot you then you can shoot them instead. So you might not get hurt if you carry guns on you for protection. 		0
Dear Principle, i feel that doing community service is a good thing to do but it is also a thing that you should choose to do like when OTHER_NAME went and did it she said that it was fun and when she had gotten done with it she said that she felt better and she felt like she had did a really good thing for her and for her community and also for her family I also feel like you should be able to choose if you want to help others because in school and in life you don't have allot of choices that you can make by your self and i feel that in middle school, and also high school you should be able to make choices and make good choices and feel good and happy about your choices also i think that if you made it a rule that every kid had to perform service it then i feel like you would have more problems with wanting to do it and having to do it because i feel that community service is one of those things that you should want to do not because you have to.  Another take that i have is that it is a good thing for people that are trouble makers and have no respect because it shows them that they are more fortunate for what they have and show them how good they really got it also i feel like it would change them as a person and it would change the way they act in front of other people and the way they act as a citizen so i feel that it is up to you weather or not you want to do good for others and even yourself.  sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
 Working with a group has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it allows individuals to collaborate, learn from each other, and be more social. On the other hand, it can lead to pressure, distractions, and a loss of individuality. When working alone, individuals have the freedom to work at their own pace, but may miss out on the benefits of collaboration and social interaction. Ultimately, the choice between working alone or in a group depends on the individual's goals, preferences, and circumstances.  One of the main advantages of working in a group is the ability to collaborate and learn from one another. When individuals work together, they can share ideas, resources, and expertise, leading to a more efficient and effective outcome. Additionally, working in a group can provide opportunities for social interaction, which can be beneficial for personal growth and development.  However, working in a group can also be challenging. For example, individuals may be pressured to meet certain deadlines or expectations, which can lead to stress and conflict. Additionally, distractions and interpersonal dynamics can arise, which can be difficult to manage.  When working alone, individuals have the freedom to work at their own pace and in their own way. This can be beneficial for individuals who prefer a more structured and focused approach to work. However, working alone can also lead to feelings of isolation and a lack of social interaction, which can be detrimental to personal well-being.  Ultimately, the choice between working alone or in a group depends on the individual's goals, preferences, and circumstances. Some individuals may thrive in a group setting, while others may prefer to work alone. It is important for individuals to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of each option and choose the one that best suits their needs.		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote. I believe that this change is necessary to ensure that our elections are fair and representative of the will of the people.  The Electoral College is an outdated system that was designed to give more power to small states. However, this system is no longer necessary or fair. In recent years, there have been several elections in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. This is undemocratic and unrepresentative of the will of the people.  In 2000, George W. Bush won the presidency even though he lost the popular vote to Al Gore by 543,816 votes. This was a close election, but it was clear that the majority of voters wanted Gore to be president. The Electoral College system prevented this from happening.  In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, but Donald Trump won the election. This was a much larger margin of victory, but it was still clear that the majority of voters wanted Clinton to be president. The Electoral College system once again prevented this from happening.  These two elections are just two examples of how the Electoral College has failed to represent the will of the people. I believe that it is time to abolish this outdated system and elect the president by popular vote. This would ensure that every vote counts and that the president who is elected is the person who the majority of voters want.  I know that some people argue that the Electoral College is necessary to protect the interests of small states. However, I believe that this is not a valid argument. The Electoral College gives more power to small states than they would otherwise have, but this does not mean that they are not represented in the government. Senators and representatives are elected by popular vote, so small states have a voice in Congress.  I urge you to support a bill that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the president by popular vote. This change is necessary to ensure that our elections are fair and representative of the will of the people.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, Your Name		1
The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and well-documented. Limiting car usage can help to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and promote physical activity. In addition, limiting car usage can save money and improve quality of life.  One of the most important advantages of limiting car usage is that it can help to improve air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and reducing the number of cars on the road can lead to cleaner air for everyone. In fact, a study by the Environmental Protection Agency found that reducing vehicle emissions by just 1% can save up to 4,000 lives each year.  Limiting car usage can also help to reduce traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can lead to a number of problems, including increased pollution, lost time, and stress. Reducing the number of cars on the road can help to alleviate traffic congestion and make it easier for people to get around.  In addition to improving air quality and reducing traffic congestion, limiting car usage can also promote physical activity. When people walk or bike instead of driving, they get more exercise, which can help to reduce their risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. In fact, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that people who walk or bike for transportation are more likely to meet the physical activity guidelines than people who drive.  Finally, limiting car usage can also save money. Car ownership and operating costs can be a major expense, and reducing the number of cars in a household can save a significant amount of money. In addition, people who walk or bike instead of driving can save money on gas, parking, and insurance.  In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can help to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, promote physical activity, and save money. If you are looking for ways to improve your health, save money, and reduce your impact on the environment, consider limiting your car usage.		1

### Limiting Car Usage: The Advantages  In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This movement has been driven by a number of factors, including concerns about air pollution, traffic congestion, and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  There are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. First, it can help to improve air quality. Cars are one of the major sources of air pollution, and reducing car usage can help to reduce emissions of harmful pollutants like nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Air pollution is a major health concern, and reducing it can have a significant impact on public health.  Second, limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can waste time, fuel, and money. Reducing car usage can help to ease traffic congestion and make travel more efficient.  Third, limiting car usage can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing car usage can help to reduce our impact on climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions are a major cause of climate change, and reducing them is essential to protecting our planet.  Fourth, limiting car usage can help to promote physical activity. When people walk or bike instead of driving, they get more exercise. Physical activity is important for good health, and promoting it can help to reduce obesity and other chronic diseases.  Fifth, limiting car usage can help to build community. When people walk or bike instead of driving, they are more likely to interact with their neighbors. This can help to build a sense of community and make neighborhoods more livable.  In conclusion, there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote physical activity, and build community. If we want to create a healthier, more sustainable future, we need to find ways to limit our reliance on cars.  In addition to the advantages listed above, limiting car usage can also save money. Cars are expensive to purchase, maintain, and insure. When people walk, bike, or take public transportation, they save money on these costs. In some cases, they may even be able to get rid of their car altogether, which can save them even more money.  Limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on the environment. When people drive less, they produce fewer emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. This helps to improve air quality and reduce climate change.  Overall, there are many good reasons to limit car usage. It can save money, improve health, and protect the environment. If we all make an effort to drive less, we can make a big difference for the planet.		1
The "four-day school week" idea has the potential to be both helpful and detrimental for students. In certain scenarios, the increased time for rest and relaxation could result in a decrease in student stress, allowing them to give their best efforts in class. However, the shorter school week could reduce the students' amount of time to complete other activities like sport or extracurriculars. Additionally, there is a chance that it may have a lingering negative impact on students' future success as fewer days in the school week could equate to less knowledge and a lack of preparation for college or the workforce.		1
Dear Principle,  Hello! I was wondering if you have made your decision on the community service projects. I think as a student I would not want to do the project but, as a person who is getting help from the students I would want the help from the students. As a student I think it would be a great opportunity to help people in need because some day you never know if you will need help. So if you are not going to require that students to do community service than you have made your decision and I can not change that. if you require community service than thank you. You have just helped a person in the community that needed help. One time when I was doing community service, one of the people that i was helping came up to me and thanked me for what i was doing and she said that i would be greatly rewarded someday. i think that you should require community service because not all people have the same things as us and they need to learn that life can be very hard. I want people to experience what it feels like to help someone in need. I know some people that already do community service and they love it they say that it is a good thing to do and they enjoy helping people in need. But other students want to sit around and be lazy and you don't want sluggish students do you, I don't.  Your Student,  STUDENT_NAME		0
The artical asked me if i could imagine a time when you no longer have to drive your car but rather that it drives it's self. I can imagine a car that drives it self, I can imagine a green sky and blue grass, I can imagine just about anything. What is really posible and how far is too far? When I ask my self the same question I say yes I can Imagine it but am not sure of it's fact. I wonder about how the car can navitgate at night, who is responsible if a collision occurs, and how much privacy is lost when driving one of these self driving cars.  The car that can drive its self sounds right out of a cartoon or some kind of science fiction book and it makes me conserned about how relivent it would acualy be on the streets in the real world. How can I feel safe in a car traveling at high speeds on a dark night with winding roads, and the chance of a wondering animal or person to cross the path of the self driving car? In my eyes our technology needs to drasticaly improve before self driving at night is thing that these cars do.  I the car crashes for any reason who is reponsible for the damage of life that may had been taken? Their will need to be a fully functioning self driving car no assistance needed, so good the the probibility of a crash is small as getting struck by lightning. Until this thing is thuroughly fool proof they should'nt be able one public road, street, ave, or any other driving path. They say the confusion could posibialy be stopped by putting a camera in the car showing who was in control of the vehical at the moment of the crash but hoe much of the story would that tell?  For me the idea of being watched by cameras through out the car is enough to lose my attention completely. I feel very stongly about personal privacy and would not want to be watched by complete strangers every time I am in my car. These cameras may be helpfull if they are only on at emergincies to help with understanding what has happened, but would'nt like the feeling of being watched on my everyday comute.  In all im pretty pesimistic about the self driving cars and a little curious to see if im totaly wrong or was I on to something and that these things are not the way to go. In the catigory of tough situations such as night time, collisions, and privacy improvement is necicary for the self driving cars to become a reality. I am looking forward to seeing how the self driving cars do and hope that the bugs get worked out so that self driving cars are a reality and it's not something I just imagine is real and well.		0
Many authors write about how we should do certain things even if they don't apppeal to us or seem possible. Authors are supposed to support their claims. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy puruit despite the dangers well.  First, the author talks about Venus is almost like Earth's twin. In paragraph 2, he states how Venus is similar to Earth in many ways. One way is how they have similar sizes and desities. He also says Venus is sometimes the closest planet to Earth.  Second, the author states the challenges and solutions to them. In paragraph 3, he states that, "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 900 degrees Fahrenheit..." His solution is to fly above the surface where its still pretty hot, but nothing compared to the surface. He also states how the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth's. His solution for that is also flying above it because high enough would be similar to Earths  Third, the author talks about how NASA is working on ways to vist Venus. In paragraph 7, the author states that NASA is testing things in atmospheres similar to Venus's. So far, they've stayed in a few weeks before being destroyed. He talks about how mechanical computers could survive it. Modern computers are destroyed easily with the extreme conditions of Venus, but mechanical ones that use cogs wouldn't be destroyed as easily.  The author has valid claims and supports them well. It's important that authors support their claims. Authors write about many different topics all the time.		0
 As a result of the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life, scientists have discovered a variety of unusual events and phenomena on the surface of Mars. One of the most intriguing discoveries made on Mars in recent years is the face-like structure located in the Valles Marineris canyon. This face-like pattern has captured the attention of many scientists and laypeople alike, leading to much discussion and speculation about its origins and potential significance. The face on Mars is a fascinating subject that has sparked many theories about the existence of intelligent life on the red planet, as well as the possibility of extraterrestrial forces at work.  The first image of the face on Mars was taken by NASA's rover, Opportunity, in 2005. The rover was exploring the Valles Marineris canyon, which is one of the largest canyons on Mars. As the rover moved through the canyon, it captured images of the Martian surface, including the face-like structure. Since then, other spacecraft, such as the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, have continued to document the face and take high-resolution images, allowing researchers to gather more information about its shape and features.  Despite the impressive features of the face on Mars, many scientists are skeptical of its origins. Some believe that the face is actually a form of natural sedimentation, caused by the movement of water and wind on the Martian surface. Others believe that the face is the result of volcanic activity, with eruptions and lava flows forming the patterns. Still, others speculate that the face may be a result of some form of extraterrestrial activity, with aliens either creating the patterns or leaving behind some form of technology on the surface of Mars.  One theory suggests that the face on Mars may be a form of artificial construction, created by an intelligent civilization that once inhabited the red planet. This theory is based on the idea that intelligent beings may have had the ability to terraform the Martian surface and create structures that could withstand the harsh Martian environment. Supporters of this theory point to the impressive scale and intricacy of the face, arguing that it is unlikely to have been created by natural processes alone.  However, skeptics of this theory argue that there is little evidence to support the idea that intelligent life ever existed on Mars. While some have suggested that the face may be a form of communication or warning from an extinct civilization, others argue that it is too simplistic to believe that aliens could have left behind such a structure with no discernible purpose.  Overall, the face on Mars remains a fascinating and mysterious subject that has captured the imagination of many people. While there is still much to be learned about the origins and significance of the face, it continues to inspire curiosity and wonder about the possibility of extraterrestrial life on the red planet. Whether it is a natural formation, the result of volcanic activity, or an artifact of an extinct civilization, the face on Mars is a testament to the ongoing search for answers to the age-old question: Are we alone in the universe? As we continue to explore the depths of the cosmos, the discovery of the face on Mars serves as a reminder that we have much to learn about the strange and wondrous phenomena that exist beyond our own planet.		1
The program will take high school students through an extensive overview of the possible career options available after graduation. We will discuss the pros and cons of each option, based on research of the job market, and the possible salary and benefits options that come with each career choice.   Additionally, the program will also focus on curbing drug, alcohol, and gang-related problems in teenagers. We will explore actionable solutions, such as parenting classes, handing out pamphlets on avoiding these issues, and educating teens on the potential consequences of these behaviors. Finally, we will discuss the importance of creating positive, productive activities for teens as they transition into adulthood.		1
In this artical, Driverless cars are coming, tells us about the technological development that we are able to come up with today. My standpoint on the driverless cars is that I am against them. Not only are they dangerous, but they can also be deadly. they can easly crash, they can put people out of jobs, and they would also take a lot of money to build firstly, the driverless cars can easly crash. If the driver is not paying attention, the car would not be able to navigate by itself, therefore causing a possible accident. The driverless car is still technically not a driverless car, it still needs human help, like backing out of driveways, navigating in difficult traffic construction, and also navigating through roadwork. if the driver is not alert, then the cr would not be able to turn itself.  secondly, they would put millions of taxy driver and other people out of work. if the problems are worked out of the car, them they will soon be on the road. the taxi services and other car makers will soon be out of work because then would the people of the usa want to drive themselfs around when they could just sit back and relax while the car does all the work.  thirdly, they will be a lot of money to build. Just to build one of them would cost millions and millions of dollers. this would then put the economy at risk because it is being taken out of state taxes. this would cause the government to start taxing everything to help get the taxes back up. with all of the sensors and technology put into the driverless car, nobody would be able to buy it, maybe millionairs.  in conclusion, the driverless car seens to be a good ides, but thinking about it now, with all the new styled technology bring put into it, you just have to weigh the risks and the good things involved with owning it. its a great idea, but it still seems to have some gliches.		0
As a high school student, I have witnessed firsthand the increasing use of social media platforms by my peers and the general public. While social media has its benefits, such as enabling us to stay connected with friends and family, it also poses a significant risk to our privacy. The amount of personal information shared online has increased dramatically, and this trend is likely to continue. Therefore, I strongly believe that there is a need for stronger privacy protections on social media.  One of the main reasons why we need stronger privacy protections on social media is to prevent identity theft. Cybercriminals can easily access our personal information, such as our full names, birth dates, addresses, and phone numbers, which we often share on social media platforms without giving it much thought. This information can then be used to steal our identities, open credit card accounts in our names, or commit other fraudulent activities. Stronger privacy protections would make it more difficult for cybercriminals to access our personal information, reducing the risk of identity theft.  Another reason why we need stronger privacy protections on social media is to protect our reputations. Many people share personal information, photos, and videos on social media without considering the potential consequences. This information can be easily accessed by employers, college admissions officers, and others who may use it to make decisions about us. If inappropriate or embarrassing content is shared online, it can damage our reputations and have long-term consequences. Stronger privacy protections would give us more control over who can access our personal information, reducing the risk of reputational harm.  Finally, stronger privacy protections on social media are needed to protect our mental health. Social media can be a breeding ground for cyberbullying, which can have serious consequences for our mental well-being. Cyberbullying can lead to anxiety, depression, and even suicide. Stronger privacy protections would make it more difficult for cyberbullies to target us, reducing the risk of mental health issues associated with social media use.  In conclusion, the rise of social media has led to an increase in the amount of personal information shared online, which poses significant risks to our privacy. Identity theft, reputational harm, and mental health issues are just a few of the potential consequences of sharing too much information on social media. Therefore, I strongly believe that there is a need for stronger privacy protections on social media to mitigate these risks. As users, we have a right to control who can access our personal information, and		1
Oil has been linked to numerous health effects and can adversely affect students ?performance in school. Studies have found that diets high in processed foods that typically contain trans-fats, saturated fats, and other unhealthy components due to the processing of regular oils can cause states of fatigue, difficulty concentrating in school and decreased academic performance. This is why some people believe that school cafeterias should not change their food.   On the other hand, replacing unhealthy processed oils with healthy, unsaturated vegetable oils, such as olive or sunflower oil, can contribute to better nutrition, leading to increased energy, mental clarity, and better academic performance. Consequently, many people argue that school cafeterias should update their offerings to include healthier alternatives in order to promote better nutrition and academic performance in school.		1
Dear, Florida State Senator  Right now there are many disputes and arguments over wether or not to keep the electoral college. Personally where I stand, I think that the electoral college should have less power, but not be totally rid. Reason for my opinion is that alot of times the electoral college has too much say, and we the people dont have enough say. For example, Barack Obama recieved 61.7% of the electoral vote compered to 51.3% of the popular vote. The electoral college had the most say and impact upon the outcome of the election. Most of the time electoral college makes mistakes on who they pick.  Everything they say is based of an intellectuall standpoint. The pick shouldnt be based off of all intellectuall. That doesnt mean the electoral college is bad, if it werent for them I think we the people are too stupid to make the decisons just ourselves. we need intellectual. Most voters dont even know much about who they pick. We shouldnt be trusted with all of the say in the election. Thats why we need electoral college to balance it out and make it right in the end. Alls im saying is dont give them all the say in who wins the election just lower it a bit to be 50-50.  Sincerely,  We the people ;)    		0

 Problems are opportunities for growth and improvement. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement because of several reasons. Firstly, if you don't take action to address a problem, it will only worsen and become more difficult to solve. Secondly, facing challenges can make you feel more competitive and motivated to overcome them. Lastly, having the support of friends and family can make all the difference in solving a problem.  When faced with a problem, it's important to take responsibility for it and do your best to find a solution. For example, if someone is constantly bullying you, it's important to take action and address the issue. Ignoring the problem will only make it worse and more difficult to solve in the future.  It's important to remember that you are not alone when facing problems. Having the support of friends and family can provide a fresh perspective and help you find solutions that you may not have considered on your own. Additionally, talking to someone about your problems can help alleviate stress and make you feel better.  In conclusion, problems are opportunities for growth and improvement. By taking action, staying motivated, and having the support of friends and family, you can overcome any challenge that comes your way.		1
Throughout our school career's projects are often assigned to extend learning during the summer break. Summer projects are more often created by teachers. These projects are rather extensive due to the months that are given to complete it. Those who may oppose¬†state that it is the teachers job to create these summer assignments and they are able to bring more structure¬†to the project. Although some may disagree that student projects should be designed by teachers, it should be known that this is not true.  Students creating their own summer projects can benefit them as students. Assignments that are completed by students are created by teachers, followed by a due date in which it is to be completed. After the assignment is completed the moving on to the next. Over time assignments become a chore and are less likely to be completed by students. Allowing students the chance to create their own summer project that they would truly excited to work. Through their own creation topics that students are interested about can be integrated into the summer project. Even though the summer project could be less structured it would completed time and time again. Having created their own assignments students would better understand what is to be expected in the terms of how to not only completed but also pass. Once on summer break students are unable to contact teachers if they have any questions about the project through having created it themselves this would eliminate the unanswered questions. If students were allowed to create their own summer projects it would give them a sense of control over their learning that is often lost throughout the school year. Some students can become detached from their learning with endless amounts of work that is assigned to them. Through the creation their summer projects it would also allow students to place their input and become more hands on within their learning.  Through creating their own assignments, students are able to build qualities that are helpful in a work environment. The process of coming up with rubrics and topics in which the assignment could be upon can be difficult. Team collaboration is vital for creating an assignment along side teachers and other students. Having the ability to voice an idea or criticism¬†can be useful not only within school but also in an work environment. Not only having to create but also complete their assignment helps develop a sense of work ethic that is¬†helpful in any situation. Students often rush to complete assignments very last minute and having formulated the assignment they would have a better understanding of how to space out their time to complete the summer project correctly. Along with school¬†assignments this skill can be applied to any work place.  Summer projects can help extend learning outside of school during summer break. Through students creating their own summer project there is a better understanding of the project but also an excitement to complete it. Having created their project a sense of control over students learning can be gained which is often lost throughout the school year. Those who oppose may state that teachers should create summer projects because they have more experience than students and that teachers are able to introduce new topics to students. Students are often detached from their learning; therefor, allowing them to create a project that could possibly worked on for months can help student regain their love of learning.		0
Dear Principal ,  I think you shouldn't require all students to perform in community service because some students may think differently from other students.  For Example some students like to work in community service but some don't. Some Students think that community service takes time away from there activities. I think that community service is for people that like to participate in there community activities and voluntear on them. Community service is a great thing because it shows us students to care more about other people and our community to make it better. Also community service helps us come all together to make our community a better place for the people that live in our community and that it helps us get along and work tall together to achieve something that we want to make better. I personally think that working in community service helps us a lot because we all come together and help each other to have a better place to live. Some of community services are really fun . For example you can help elementary school student or help the elderly people in the nursing homes because some of there families don't visit them a lot and there their in those nursing homes alone.		0
What do you do after school hours? A lot of students spend their time playing sports, doing homework, studying, and also hanging out with friends. My principal has recently added a new rule saying that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activty such as school sports, working on the year book, or serving for student council. I personally dont think this is a good rule for various reasons, school is enough for kids the way it is and students should be able to do what they want after school.  My main reason is that students already spend 7 hours every day at school and they shouldn't have to work more after school for things that might not even benefit them. I think studnets should be able to spend their time on whatever they like to do as long as they go to school alongside with it. Students should be able to decide what they want to do after school and can play sports and sign up for activitys if thats what they want to spend their time on but I dont think they should be forced.  Another reason why i think students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activitys is that most students are already stressed out with homework and studying outside of school. If students are already stressed out with outside activitys then why should they be forced to do another things on top of what they already have? A lot of students get stressed out over school related things and if the school makes them do more things outside of school it'll just make them more stressed.  Lastly, a lot of students dont just spend their time doing nothing all night, most students play a sport or play instrument or find something to do after school hours. And if they don't they're probably busy studying or working on homework. Students dont just sit around and do nothing all night so i think this rule is pointless because a lot of students are already busy doing things. And if some students have to do more things on top of what they already do then that will only cause more stress and might make grades drop because they don't have as much time for school things.  So what do you like to do after school? Does what you do take up most of your time or are you bored a lot? And most importantly do you think that students should be required to particicpate in extracurricular activitys? These are my reasons why i think we shouldn't.		0
Distance learning is becoming an increasingly popular option for students who are looking to attend classes from the comfort of home. There are a few key pros and cons that should be considered when deciding if distance learning is the right option for individual students.   One of the main advantages of distance learning is the convenience that it offers. Students have greater flexibility in terms of when and where they can attend class, making it easier for them to maintain concentration. However, there is still an element of distraction from the home environment, particularly when it comes to online shopping.   Another benefit of distance learning is that students have access to a wide range of learning materials, such as online books and videos, making it easier to acquire the resources necessary for their studies. Along with this, distance learning offers lower costs than traditional schooling, making it an attractive option for families with financial constraints.   Yet, one of the main disadvantages of distance learning is the lack of social contact with peers and teachers. Additionally, online bullying is a real issue, and it can be harder to detect and prevent than in-person bullying. For these reasons, some students may benefit from the increased support and social interaction of traditional schools.   In conclusion, distance learning is a great option for students who are looking to attend classes from home. That being said, it‚Äôs important to consider the various pros and cons before committing to a distance-learning course.		1
  Dear [State Senator],  I hope this letter finds you well. As you consider the matter of the Electoral College and the process of electing the President of the United States, I wanted to share my thoughts on why I believe it is important to retain this system.  One of the primary arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a more reliable and decisive outcome in the presidential election. As Judge Richard A. Posner notes in "In Defense of the Electoral College," the Electoral College system has produced only five instances of a tie in the electoral vote, and none of these have resulted in a catastrophic crisis for the country (Posner 3). In contrast, a popular vote system would leave the outcome of the election vulnerable to manipulation and fraud, as we saw in the 2000 presidential election. The Electoral College also provides a sense of certainty and finality to the election process, as the candidate who receives the most electoral votes is guaranteed to be the next President.  Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages presidential candidates to campaign and pay attention to a wide range of states, rather than solely focusing on heavily Democratic or Republican areas. As Bradford Plumer notes in "The Indefensible Electoral College," this forces candidates to consider the concerns and needs of voters in various regions of the country, instead of simply relying on their base of support (Plumer). This helps to promote a more inclusive and representative government, as candidates must take into account the views and concerns of a diverse range of voters.  Furthermore, the Electoral College has a long and storied history in the United States, with roots dating back to the founding of the country. As Posner notes, the Electoral College has been		1
Extra curricular activities give students an opportunity to be on a team or with a group of people with shared interests as them. They are very beneficial for students, but many kids don't participate¬†in after school activities because they are to busy with school.  Because some parents force there kids to spend little to no time with there friends and hours studying. Their kids may end up with little social skills and poor mental health. Though excessive time studying may seem beneficial; to much time studying actually harms the students. Mandatory extra curricular activities would help to give students more control over their lives and let them to have a social life. Many adults would have never thought to try any after school activities if their school didn't force them to, yet so many parents don't allow there kids to participate in those activities that they once loved as a kid. A lot of students feel at ease when doing a sport or playing their instrument, and they never would have thought to try it if they had no reason to. Making students participate in extra curricular activities is beneficial for their physical and mental health because it helps students make more friends and find their passion.  Since there is so much pressure for student to maintain a high GPA, some students make studying more of a priority than their social life. It gets so extreme to the point where some students spend all there time doing homework, but spend little to no time hanging out with their friends. This makes students struggle socially. Extra curricular activities give students a chance to take a break from homework and be in a group of people with the same interests and same goal as them. Pushing students to do extra curricular activities would help them to spend less time studying and more time spent on an activity that they love. There are a lot of students that are strong academically, but many of those students can't communicate with other people or work in a team, so no matter how smart they are they wouldn't excel in any job. Because every job requires communication and social skills, students need to develop those skills while still in school to get a secure job in their future. Increasing communication and teamwork is not the only reason that after school activities are beneficial.  There are many adults that would have never found their passion if there weren't activities for them to try. Since stress is only increasing for students, they tend to spend more time studying trying to improve already good grades then doing an activity that they love. Students feel so stuck feeling like they can only do school work, but when they have other activities it can really clear their head; as well as make them realize that they work well in a certain field. For example if a student were to join the SCA and like it they could realize that they want to take on more leadership roles and one day run a company. If that student was forced to study and had no free time to be on the SCA they may have never realized how much they like leadership roles. They may have never gotten the chance to start the company and there life would be so different. Plus students are more likely to get accepted in a good college for continuing with an activity that they love with a slightly lower GPA then having a perfect GPA, never have participating in any extra curricular activities, so after school activities are also helping students to get into college.  A lot of extra curricular activities are offered, and by making them mandatory it will make many students realize that they are passionate about some things. Whether that activity be a sport, an instrument, or a leadership role. While there is something out there for everyone students wanting to participate in an activity isn't as common as many may think. Pushing students to find their activity will help them in their future. There is no way out of communication and teamwork so giving students the opportunity to learn those skills in school only benefits them. By not enforcing extra curricular activities on students, many students futures are being harmed. By not letting kids have social lives or giving students the opportunity to find their passion students are going to struggle in their future adult life a lot more then they ever needed to struggle. This can be avoided by just simply making after school activities mandatory; having students focus on things other then school and studying.		0
 The electoral college is a group of electors appointed by the political parties who ultimately decide the outcome of a presidential election in the United States. The system has been in place since the founding of the country, and it is a contentious topic that has been debated for decades. Some argue that the electoral college works well, while others argue that it is outdated and should be abolished. In this essay, I will explore both sides of the debate and determine whether the electoral college system is effective or not.  On one hand, supporters of the electoral college system argue that it works well because it gives weight to the votes of each state based on its population. The system reflects the will of the people, and it ensures that no one state has too much influence over the election. In this way, the electoral college ensures that political power is distributed more evenly throughout the country.  Furthermore, proponents of the electoral college argue that the system helps to prevent the election from being dominated by large urban areas. Instead, it gives voters in rural and urban areas an equal voice in the election. As a result, the country as a whole gets a better representation in the White House.  On the other hand, opponents of the electoral college system argue that it is outdated and doesn't reflect the will of the people. They claim that the system is now skewed towards the states with the highest population, and that smaller states are being unfairly ignored. This can lead to candidates concentrating their efforts in states with larger population concentrations, leaving other states without the same level of representation.  Furthermore, opponents of the electoral college argue that the system does not accurately reflect the will of the people because it can result in a candidate winning the popular vote nationwide but losing the election. For example, in the 2000 presidential election, Al Gore won the popular vote by over 500,000 votes, but he lost the election because he didn't win the electoral vote in Florida.  In conclusion, the electoral college system is a contentious topic that has been debated for decades. While supporters argue that the system works well and reflects the will of the people, opponents argue that it is outdated and doesn't accurately reflect the will of the people. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the system will depend on the political climate and the values of the people.		1
  Dear [State Senator],  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen and student of politics, I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and effective method of choosing the President, and I urge you to support its continuation.  One of the main arguments against the Electoral College is that it is undemocratic and unfair to voters. However, as Bradford Plumer argues in his article "The Indefensible Electoral College," the winner-take-all system used in most states means that candidates only focus on swing states, ignoring the needs and concerns of voters in other states. In contrast, the Electoral College requires candidates to have a broader appeal, as they must win votes from across the country to be elected. This leads to a more diverse and representative candidate pool, as candidates must appeal to a wider range of voters (Plumer).  Another argument against the Electoral College is that it can lead to a tie in the electoral vote, resulting in a congressional decision. However, as Judge Richard A. Posner argues in his article "In Defense of the Electoral College," this is unlikely to happen, as the total number of votes is an even number. Moreover, the Electoral College ensures that a candidate must receive a majority of votes, rather than a plurality, to be elected. This prevents the situation where a candidate wins the popular vote but loses the election due to a lack of support in key states (Posner).  Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign extensively in all states, rather than focusing solely on swing states. This means that voters in all states are more likely to receive attention and information from the candidates, leading to a		1
There are many ways a person can get from one place to another whether it is by bus, plane, train or car. Car and truck transportation is one of the leading causes in air pollution. reducing the use of cars will be beneficial to the public, not only on the streets, but to the citizens themselves.  To start off, the reduction of cars on the streets will cause less stress to the people who drive them. For example, in Source 1 it shows how a woman is happier and the loss of her car has changed her life for the better. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," she says. The tension of being in a car and waiting in traffic can be stressful and cause people to get impatient, grumpy, and even irritated. The woman proves that her life has changed because she doesn't have to go through that anymore. Her carless life is the one that makes her happy.  Besides that, not only does car reduction cause better mood for people, but it also lessens the air pollution and makes the environment cleaner and better for people to live in. According to Source 4, "If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants." This proves that when cars are being used less, there is also less carbon emission into the air and that is helpful to the environment. This benefits and makes the air cleaner and safer to breathe.  Now with every thing good, there is always a bad. In source 2 it is explained how the delivery companies were complaining of lost revenue. Yes, this will be a problem with the delivery companies, but there are other ways of transporting goods to their destination such as by train, boat etc. Also in Source 2 there were arrangements made for the the cars to go out on certain days, so the delivery companies' problems were not all that bad. The reduction of cars benefits the public more than it what it hurts.  The results of limiting car usage has been greatly proven through studies done in source 4 and it is believed that it should continue to be limited and or reinforced. The people are happier, the environment is safer and the air is clean. There is more help than there is hinder and soon it will be seen throughout the world that cars are better in the garage.		0
Dear Principal,   I am writing to provide my perspective on the school's cell phone policy options under consideration. Of the two possibilities, I believe Policy 1 is the better choice as it allows a reasonable use of technology while still supporting an effective learning environment.  Policy 1 respects that cell phones are now an integral part of students' lives outside of school. For many students, keeping in touch with family and friends during free periods is important. By permitting phones during lunch and breaks as long as they are off in class, this policy accommodates modern communication needs while also enforcing focus on schoolwork when lessons are taking place. A strict ban under Policy 2 is unrealistic given how intertwined phones are with daily life now.   Additionally, allowing controlled phone use per Policy 1 can help students feel more trusted and responsible. If given guidelines rather than prohibitions, students are more likely to properly follow the rules. By contrast, an outright ban may cause unintentional rebellion or disobedience. Treating high schoolers with appropriate freedom balanced with structure fosters maturity and citizenship.     Of course, limiting cell phone distraction during academic time remains key. Policy 1 directly addresses this concern by requiring phones be off in class. This balanced approach supports learning while still acknowledging communication needs. An absolute prohibition seems excessive and could damage student-administrator relations.  In conclusion, I believe Policy 1 offers the wisest path forward. It empowers students through reasonable trust but also maintains focus on school priorities when most important. Overall learning, well-being and school culture are best served through this balanced, pragmatic option. Thank you for considering my perspective on this important topic.		1
 The electoral college is a system used in the United States to select the president and vice president. It is a process that has been in place since the founding of the country and has been a subject of debate and controversy for many years. The question of whether the electoral college works has become even more prominent in recent years as technology has allowed for more accurate and timely tracking of voter turnout and preferences.  There are some who argue that the electoral college is an outdated and ineffective system that no longer represents the will of the people. They argue that the system is biased in favor of certain states, such as those with smaller populations, and that it doesn't give equal weight to the needs and preferences of every citizen. They also argue that the system can lead to the candidate "campaigning" only in a few key swing states, ignoring the needs and concerns of voters in other parts of the country.  Others, however, argue that the electoral college is an important part of the democratic process. They argue that it provides a stable and consistent system for selecting the president and that it helps to ensure the president is elected by the entire country, not just by voters in a few key states. They also argue that the system allows for smaller, more representative electorates, which can help to prevent the dominance of big cities and states in the selection of the president.  While the debate about the effectiveness of the electoral college is ongoing, there is no denying that it has played an important role in the history of the United States. It has allowed the country to elect a president and vice president who are elected by the entire country and not just by a few key states. The system may not be perfect, and there may be areas where it needs to be improved, but overall, it is a system that has served the country well for over two centuries.  In conclusion, the effectiveness of the electoral college is a complex issue that has been debated for many years. While there are certainly valid arguments to be made on both sides of the debate, it is clear that the electoral college is an important part of the democratic process in the United States. As such, it is important that any proposals for reforming the system take into account its strengths and weaknesses and work to create a system that represents the will of the majority of the country's citizens.		1
Dear: principle  We the students want for you too not change school policy because so some students are complaining that is not fear fore s too have a B or a C . Like many peoples have low grades. But you can make a difference by telling them that doing there work they can participate on all the activities and they can have at less a D  But if is lower then a D then they cant participate on the activities. But if you put more electives they would have too do there work and that's how they would do there work and you would be a good principle and the students will be learning a lot, but if you don't make that happed then all the students will get mad because if we don't get too participate in the activity, they would not do there work no more and they are going too get in treble.  Sincerely:STUDENT_NAME		0
I believe that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. There are several reasons why I take this position.   Firstly, dress codes help to promote a sense of equality and fairness among students. When all students are required to adhere to the same dress code, it eliminates the pressure to wear expensive or trendy clothing. This means that students from different socioeconomic backgrounds are less likely to feel excluded or marginalized based on their clothing choices.  Secondly, dress codes can help to reduce distractions in the classroom. When students are dressed appropriately for school, they are less likely to be preoccupied with how they look or what they are wearing. This can help them to focus on their studies and be more productive in class.  Lastly, dress codes can instill a sense of discipline and professionalism among students. By requiring students to dress in a particular way, it sends a message that school is a place for learning and that students should take their education seriously.  For example, when our school implemented a dress code last year, we noticed a significant improvement in the overall behavior and attitudes of our students. Fewer distractions, improved focus, and a more professional attitude created a more positive learning environment for everyone.  In conclusion, while some students may not like the idea of a dress code, I believe that the benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks. By promoting equality, reducing distractions, and instilling discipline, dress codes can be an effective tool for creating a positive learning environment in schools.		1
The author in this story has a totally different persepective on studying Venus than most people probably would. He tries not to focus on the negatives since we all know that it's humanly impossible to step foot on Venus. He feels that hummanity shouldn't just give up on the mission forvever becasue it's dangerous and we have doubts on the mission. He looks at it as motivation and a challenge, rather than impossible. You never know what we could discover there so it's always good to have a strong imagination even if people think you're crazy, because those people change the world.  NASA is still looking into this research. They understand that they can't send humans to the planet, but they have a plan to send scientists in space to float above Venus and do their research from up there. Obviously their information wouldn't be as valid from being up above the planet rather than being on the planet, but it's the closest they can get to this day. In the future they hope to be able to create technology and machinery that is strong enough to withstand the preasure and heat from the burning planet. Resaerchers believe that long ago Venus was a lot like Earth, and was covered with a lot of similar features like valleys, mountains, and craters. This planet is looked at as Earth's twin, and long ago was once covered with large bodies of water and was able to support life just like Earth. That's why they want to keep learning about the planet becasue of how similar it really is to our own.  In the end, I think that with the way NASA's technology is adavancing, they will soon one day create a device that can gather information from Venus and send it back here. They have been testing electronics made of silcon carbide and placing them in Venus like conditions. Over time, they are slowly able to start lasting longer. This shows that they're only going to get smarter and keep advancing over the years. It is probably going to take some time but in my eyes I dont think I see humans ever going there, but I do see AI making the trip up there eventually. 		0
 Thomas Jefferson's statement, "Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing," emphasizes the importance of being active and constantly striving towards something. By always working towards a goal, we can discover new things and become more aware of the world around us.  Jefferson's belief in the value of hard work is evident in his statement that "working hard to get something feels so much more cherishable." This suggests that the satisfaction we get from achieving our goals is greater than the satisfaction we get from simply waiting for things to happen.  Furthermore, Jefferson's statement that "not doing anything is bad because you are just wasting your time and sometimes other peoples time too" highlights the negative consequences of inactivity. When we are not working towards a goal, we are not making progress and we are not using our time effectively.  An example of the benefits of being active is when a student works hard to improve their grades in order to get into a better college. By striving towards this goal, the student is able to achieve a higher level of education and potentially open up more opportunities in the future.  In some situations, inactivity may be necessary, such as when someone is going through a difficult time and needs to focus on their mental health. However, in general, being active and working towards a goal is the most ideal approach.  In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson's statement highlights the importance of being active and constantly striving towards something. By working hard and making progress, we can achieve our goals and discover new things about the world around us.		1
Graduating high school in four or three years has potential advantages and drawbacks that must be considered when making the decision to pursue the shortened schedule. Summer classes are an option for those looking to graduate early, but it is important to weigh the reasons one might not want to take courses during the summer, such as exhaustion from taking classes during the school year or wanting to pursue other interests such as a job or a summer internship.   Elective classes are a great way to round out a high school educational experience. Electives may include art, music, foreign language, and other courses not typically part of the traditional curriculum. These classes may have an advantage in terms of helping a student stand out in the college application process.   Additional factors influencing student decisions include working to save money for college and the cost of supplies such as textbooks. Graduating high school early could ease the financial burden, but the amount of coursework students may miss could have a negative impact on their college readiness. Ultimately, students must consider potential financial, time, and educational implications when determining how valuable an early graduation timeline will be for their academic future.		1
In this essay I will be telling you why we should explore Venus. In The Challenge of Expolring Venus there are many dangers to it but I stll think that we should try every thing in are power to explore Venus.  I think that we should still explore Venus because it would help us out in the long run becuase we the Earth become over popluation we would need some where to go so if we can inhabit different plants like Veuns it would help man kind live longer and fully explore are solar system. In paragraph 8 supports my idea becuase it states that " Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has Valus, not onlye because of the insight to be gained on the planted itself, but alos becuase of human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating enedeavors."  In conclusion I told you why we should try to Explore and inhabit Venus and why it is a good idea for man kind in the long run.                  		0
Hey there, it's me, an average 8th grade student! üòÖ For my essay, I'm gonna talk about how asking multiple people for advice can be super helpful when you're facing a problem.  So, let's say you're trying to decide which new video game to buy. You could just go with your gut and pick the one that looks the coolest, but that might not be the best choice. By asking your friends, family, or even a gaming influencer on social media, you can get a bunch of different perspectives and opinions. Maybe one of your friends has played it and can tell you if it's any good, or maybe a gaming influencer can give you a more objective view since they've played a bunch of different games.  But it's not just about video games! Asking multiple people for advice can be helpful in any situation. Like, let's say you're trying to decide which club to join at school. You could just pick the one that seems the most fun, but by asking other kids in the club or even a teacher, you can get a better idea of what it's actually like. Maybe you'll find out that the club you thought was the most fun is actually super competitive and stressful, or maybe you'll learn that the club you never considered is actually really chill and fun.  Another cool thing about asking multiple people for advice is that you can get a more well-rounded view of the situation. Like, if you're trying to decide what college to go to, you could ask people who went to different colleges and get a feel for what it's like at each one. Maybe you'll find out that one college has a great program for your major, but the campus is really small and you wouldn't have as many opportunities to meet new people. Or maybe you'll find out that another college has a super fun social scene, but the classes are really hard.  So, in conclusion, asking multiple people for advice is super helpful because it gives you a bunch of different perspectives and opinions. It can help you make a more informed decision and find the best solution for you. Plus, it's always good to get other people's thoughts and ideas, it can help you see things		1
My opinion on using cell phones at school is positive. I think that phones should at school because it is needed for kids to call their parents to pick them up after school. Another reason is because what if one day a student finds somebody that needs help and need to call the ambulance. That student could save that persons life I say that for experience. Also in any type of emergencies like when your guardian or your friend, neighbor etc drop you of and forget something they could just call you so the guardian doesn't have to stop where their going and go all the way to the office to give them your stuff. Also the students would to check on their family when somebody is sick.  Another reason is if the principal is nice and cool enough to let us use our phones during free time. We will consider the kind ness to us and respect the knew rules. It would get us closer to the teachers and all staff. We would be like having the coolest school ever. If we are allowed to use our phones at school we would consider the principal understanding that we want to entertain ourselves when we are having free time somehow.		0
Distance learning can provide many benefits to students and teachers. I feel, students should have the choice of deciding if distance learning or traditional learning is the right fit for them. Almost, every student will be eager to take their classes online. Not everyone will agree with my opinion, but here is why I strongly believe students should follow through with distance learning. By taking classes online, students will benefit by being given the choice to waking up when they desire. It will teach students better time management skills. As well as, being able to take their time on learning a new unit without feeling rushed. I think students will excel and benefit from attend school online rather than physically attending school  To begin, a benefit from attending class from home is, waking up whenever you desire. Students should have the choice to get out of bed when their body is well rested enough to start the day. For example, some schools start at 7:15 a. m. meaning, in order to have a well breakfast, time to get ready, and arrive at school on time, will expect the student to wake up even earlier to have time to complete their morning checklist. Once they arrive to school, they will not be physically and mentally prepared to fully function once the school day has started from the lack of energy they have. If students had the to choice to wake up when they are ready to wake up, they will have more energy to complete their assignments and get their work done. Some may say, if you allow the student to wake up whenever they desire, they will not complete their work and will put it off until they are behind in their academics. This is where time management comes in play.  Some believe, by allowing the student to decide how they want to manage their day will result in major issues in failing to complete their academic work. But on the contrary, by giving students the responsibility to complete their online assignments on time and by managing their own personal life, will give them the advantage to create a schedule that fits them the best. Not every student is the same. Every student carries busy and different lives, some include: sports, work, training and other extracurricular activities. It will teach students problem solving skills in determining how they should manage their own time. Once being able to balance out their schedule, students can not only use this skill for the present but for future purposes as well.  Lastly, distance learning will allow the student to move at their own paste. It will provide the student the ability to take their time on a certain subject that requires more time an attention for them to fully grasp the information they need to know. A personal example, I struggle in math class. As a class, we learn something new each class and from that, we build on from the prior class. If I didn't understand the material taught to us from the prior class, it will be hard to grasp the new material from the next class. Because of this, I struggle to comprehend the unit while also, being ready on time to take the exam with the rest of the class; even if I end up understanding the unit, I now fall behind on my other class work that needs to be done as well. It not only interferes with my set schedule but also my own extracurricular¬†activities as well.  I believe, students will benefit from attending school online to provided for a well rested mind, improvement in time management skills, and also being able to understand the material at their own paste. Many students will excel and enjoy their high school¬†experience¬†with having the opportunity to take take their classes online. It will beyond beneficial to those students who carryout very busy lives and to those who rather just prefer to take their classes online. If all schools offered distance learning as an option for students to attend their classes online or video conferencing, I believe many students will excel in not only their academics but in their future life as well.		0
Hey there!  So, you know how there's this whole debate going on about whether high school should be three years instead of four? Like, I know some people think it's a good idea and some think it's not, but I think it's like, really interesting to think about the impact it could have on us students.   Okay, so, like, the main advantage of having a three-year high school is that it would give us more time to focus on our interests and passions. I mean, think about it, if we had an extra year to explore different subjects and activities, we could be like, super prepared for college and stuff. Plus, it would be like, way easier to balance schoolwork and extracurriculars, you know?  Like, I know some people who are already feeling super stressed out about trying to do everything, and a three-year high school could help with that.  But, like, there are also some disadvantages to consider. For example, some people might be like, "Uh, I don't know if I want to be in school for three years instead of four. That's a long time!"  And, like, some teachers might be worried about how it would affect their jobs and stuff. I mean, they're like, invested in us and everything, and they might not want to see their jobs change.   And, you know, there are other factors that could have a significant role in the decision to pursue a three-year high school. Like, what if the school district couldn't afford it? Or what if it's not allowed by the state or something?  It's like, important to think about all the potential impacts, you know?  So, like, in conclusion, I think a three-year high school could be a good idea, but we need to think about all the pros and cons and stuff. And, like, it's not just about us students, it's about the teachers and the school district and everyone involved.  It's like, a big decision, but it could be really cool to explore and learn more about it.		1
Have you ever wanted to participate in a extracurricular program?  Students must participate in at least one sport, work on the year books,or serve on the student council. This will help the students stay healthy,caleberate with others,or educate the students in different understandings. This way the students can be perductive in their time. Extracurricular programs help the students stay healthy,caleberate with others,educate them with different understandings, and have a perductive time.  Have you ever wanted a yearbook? yearbooks have many memories, and excitment . You can be apart of this exciting journey. The yearbook is a man made iteam that you help make. The yearbook also shows how you've grow up over the years. The yearbooks price will be 15$.You can capture the excitment,the memories, and the price of 15$.  Have you ever wanted to play a sport? Sports have been on this planet for many years. Their's so many options you can choose from like basketball,soccer,baseball, pingpong,cricket,or even swimming. These are all good ways of staying active. Sports have been alive for many years , they also keep you healthy so you can live an easy life.  Have you ever wanted to be apart of the school council? The school council is a great program. They all you the make statments for the schools. This is one of many choices to be a leader.

I agree with the princapal to make students be involved with extracurricluar prgrams. Sports is an easy way to be involved by saying healthy and being perductive. Yearbooks is a great ways be involed and to make a memorial of the schools years. Student council is a great way to help when needed and to make the school a better place.		0
First impressions are often the initial judgments we make about a person, place, or thing. They are formed quickly and can be difficult to change. However, research has shown that first impressions are not impossible to change. In this essay, I will explore the effects of culture, practice, and adjustment on first impressions and present evidence to support the idea that first impressions can be altered.  Culture plays a significant role in shaping first impressions. Different cultures have different norms, values, and beliefs that influence how people perceive the world around them. For example, in some cultures, it is considered impolite to make direct eye contact, while in others, it is seen as a sign of respect. If someone from a culture that values direct eye contact were to meet someone from a culture that sees direct eye contact as impolite, they may form a negative first impression of each other. However, with practice and adjustment, this first impression can be changed. For example, if someone from the culture that values direct eye contact were to spend time with someone from the culture that sees direct eye contact as impolite, they may learn to adjust their behavior and make indirect eye contact, leading to a more positive first impression.  Practice also plays a crucial role in changing first impressions. When we encounter new experiences or people, our brains form initial judgments based on the information available to us. However, as we continue to interact with the person or experience, our brain processes more information and can adjust our first impression accordingly. For example, if someone meets someone who they initially thought was rude and aloof, but who later proves to be kind and caring, their first impression may change. This change in first impression is due to the practice of continuing to interact with the person and processing more information about them.  Adjustment is also an essential factor in changing first impressions. When we encounter new experiences or people, our brains form initial judgments based on the information available to us. However, if we later learn that our initial judgment was incorrect, our brain can adjust our first impression accordingly. For example, if someone meets someone who they initially thought was unintelligent, but who later proves to be highly intelligent, their first impression may change. This change in first impression is due to the adjustment of their initial judgment based on new information.  In conclusion, first impressions are not impossible		1
 Dear Senator,  I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College as the current method for electing the President of the United States. While I understand the arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College system provides several important benefits that make it a preferable choice.  First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures that every vote counts. In a popular vote system, the candidate who wins in a few large, densely populated states could potentially win the popular vote, even if they fail to win the electoral vote. This could result in a candidate who does not represent the will of the majority of the American people being elected President. Under the Electoral College, however, a candidate must win the support of a majority of the electors in order to be elected, which means that every vote counts, regardless of where it is cast.  Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in all 50 states, not just in a few key swing states. This ensures that candidates are not only focused on winning the support of voters in a few key regions, but are also paying attention to the needs and concerns of voters across the country. This diversity of focus is an important aspect of a healthy democracy, as it ensures that candidates are not only focused on winning the support of a few key groups, but are also considering the needs and concerns of a broad range of voters.  Furthermore, the Electoral College system provides a level of certainty in the outcome of the election. While it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the electoral vote, this has only happened in a handful of rare instances. In contrast, a popular vote system could potentially result in a situation where no candidate wins a clear majority, leading to a protracted and uncertain period of time before a president can be elected. This level of uncertainty is not desirable in a democratic system, and the Electoral College provides a level of certainty that is lacking in a popular vote system.  In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College system provides several important benefits that make it a preferable choice for electing the President of the United States. It ensures that every vote counts, encourages candidates to campaign in all 50 states, and provides a level of certainty in the outcome of the election. While there may be arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a more effective and equitable method for electing the President of the United States.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Dear Principal,  Imagine you were a kid at school, and you forgot it was a shortened day. You need to call your parents but, no, you can't because your principal decided to ban cell phones all together. Now what? For this reason, I strongly support Policy 1. In case of emergencies or even to make sure of an after-school event, phones could be in great use. With Policy 2 in act, you could be staying in school for many hours until your ride picks you up.  In case of an emergency, a phone would be great to have. What if, during lunch, my friend breaks a bone or gets an asthma attack. There would be no time to call a teacher for help and even if they did come, what would they do for help? Any student's first instinct would be to take out their phone and call 911. Once your done with that, you tell your friend to call a teacher from somewhere so that they can handle the situation. "Whew," you say. "thankfully I had my cell phone."  Another reason why having a functional mobile at school would be nice to have: a ride. I forgot I had basketball practice at the gym after school and what should I do? You can simply call your ride and telling them they need to come later. What if your ride was your mom and you didn't have your phone because you didn't want any phones in your school? Well I can almost imagine what will happen next: my mom comes to pick me up, she doesn't find me, and every mom's first reaction to this mishap will be, "MY SON/DAUGHTER HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED!" This "exciting" commotion happened because you decided to go with Policy 2.  Please consider this letter because if you don't, before you know it, our school's phone bill will increase because students will be needing to use school phones to call people. With this, our budget will decrease, leaving the school left with no money for more important reasons.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
 Should students have partnerships with companies that align with their career goals? Students often believe that working with various businesses is beneficial to their future prospects. If a student is uncertain about their career path, partnerships with companies can help them gain clarity and direction. Students should form partnerships with companies because they can gain valuable skills and knowledge about their desired career, learn more about the industry they are interested in, and determine if the job they want is truly the right fit for them.  First, partnerships with companies can provide students with the opportunity to gain practical experience and skills relevant to their desired career. By working alongside professionals in the field, students can learn how to apply theoretical concepts to real-world situations. They can also gain insights into the day-to-day operations of a company, which can help them make more informed decisions about their career path.  Second, partnerships with companies can provide students with a deeper understanding of the industry they are interested in. By working with a company, students can gain a more nuanced understanding of the industry, including its challenges, opportunities, and trends. This can help them make more informed decisions about their career path and prepare them for the challenges they may face in the future.  Third, partnerships with companies can help students determine if the job they want is truly the right fit for them. Similar to the other two points, this helps them, but not only if they want to pursue in that job. Also, they can find a backup plan if that business is not the right one for them. They can go see if it's a bad business, if it helps with the future, and if it's the job they want to go after. They can't focus on that one thing if they don't see it for themselves, they're going to find something that they want to do not what they need to do.  In conclusion, partnerships with companies can be a valuable resource for students looking to gain skills, knowledge, and experience relevant to their desired career. By working with a company, students can gain practical experience, a deeper understanding of the industry, and determine if the job they want is truly the right fit for them. While there may be those who argue that working with a company will not provide any value, the benefits of partnerships cannot be overstated. Students who take advantage of these opportunities are more likely to make informed decisions about their career path and		1
Climate change has become a significant issue in recent years, with many arguing that governments should take immediate action to address it. While some believe that this is a problem that needs to be addressed urgently, others argue that there are other more pressing issues that require attention. In this essay, I will argue in favor of the idea that governments should take immediate action to address climate change.  Firstly, the effects of climate change are becoming increasingly evident, with rising sea levels, increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, and changes in weather patterns. The impact of these changes is felt not only in the environment but also in the economy, with industries such as agriculture, tourism, and fishing being affected. If governments do not take action to address climate change, the situation is likely to worsen, and the effects will become more severe.  Secondly, the cost of inaction is likely to be much higher than the cost of taking action. The economic costs of natural disasters and the damage caused by climate change are already significant, and these costs are likely to increase if nothing is done. On the other hand, taking action to address climate change may require an initial investment, but it is likely to be much less than the cost of dealing with the consequences of inaction.  Finally, taking action to address climate change is not only necessary but also presents opportunities for economic growth and development. Investing in renewable energy sources and promoting sustainable practices can create new jobs and boost economic growth. It can also promote innovation and technological advancement, which can have far-reaching benefits for society.  In conclusion, the issue of climate change is a significant problem that requires immediate action. Governments must take action to address this problem, not only to mitigate the effects of climate change but also to promote economic growth and development. While there may be costs associated with taking action, the cost of inaction is likely to be much higher. Therefore, it is essential that we act now to address climate change and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.		1
Dear, TEACHER_NAME  I am making this argument based on the fact that you are willing to change the schools policy so that way us students may not be capable with participating in any school activities unless we have a B average grade. I do believe that you should not change anything because of the fact that most of the kids here don't care bout there grade as much as I do and that's putting a affect toward my fun time.  i am trying my best to succeed in all of my subjects but just because of the fact that you are not satisfied with the other kids behavior and their grades i do not think that you should take out all of you anger on the kids that are actual good students but their class work just might not be on point as the other kids. I just really hope you take as much time as you need to think this through because most of the kids would be mad well at least the ones that care the most. This is really a great opportunity to consider doing what you doing but i also think you should let us all sit down with you and the president, state treasure, and vice president of us kids and have a meeting just to discuss your decision. I think that would only be fair for us the kids because even though you are grown lady i completely understand that but u would also have to take time out and realize that i takes a lot of effort and work to change the school policy.  Thank you for your time sincerely, STUDENT_NAME		0
Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:  Pros and Cons of Allowing Schools with Older and Younger Students  As I sit here thinking about the topic of schools with older and younger students, I can't help but think of my own school experience. I've been in middle school for a few years now, and I've seen my fair share of younger and older students. Some schools have programs that allow younger students to attend, while others have programs that allow older students to come in. But what are the pros and cons of these programs, and how can we make them successful?  One pro of having schools with older and younger students is that it can help with socialization. Younger students can learn from older students, and older students can teach them important life skills. For example, older students can teach younger students how to play sports, how to study for tests, and how to be responsible. This can help younger students feel more comfortable in school and make friends more easily.  Another pro is that it can help with academic achievement. Older students can help younger students with their schoolwork, and younger students can learn from older students' experiences. For example, older students can help younger students with math problems, and younger students can learn about the importance of hard work and dedication.  However, there are also some cons to having schools with older and younger students. One con is that it can be difficult for older students to focus on their own schoolwork. They may feel like they have to take care of the younger students, which can be frustrating for them. Another con is that younger students may not take the older students seriously, which can lead to disruptions in the classroom.  To make a successful program, I think schools should have clear rules and expectations for both older and younger students. For example, older students should be expected to help younger students, but they should also be given time to focus on their own schoolwork. Younger students should be taught to respect older students and take their help seriously.  In conclusion, having schools with older and younger students can be beneficial for both groups, but it's important to have clear rules and expectations in place to make the program successful. By allowing older and younger students to learn from each other, we can create a more		1
If you were able to take online classes wouldn't you take them. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. Distance¬†learning is a program that allows you to take classes by way of online instead of physically¬†attending a class. Taking online classes has many benefits that contribute to your personal life and also your student life. Online classes allows you to work at your own pace, have more time for yourself, and be able¬†to work without any distractions. I believe that distance learning is a great option for schools to offer students.  Physically attending a class can sometimes be stressful. Teachers only have a certain amount of time to teach you what they have plan for that day and they tend to rush you. But what some teachers don't understand is that everybody doesn't learn at the same speed. It takes some students longer to understand what they are teaching. If you take online classes you wouldn't have to worry about anyone rushing you, because you can work at your own pace.  When you attend a class you really don't have time to take care of yourself, especially if you have multiple classes in one day. When its time to leave school you probably have to go straight home because you have to write an essay or have other homework to do. Also if you play a sport that makes it harder, because you have to balance your life, school, and the sport that you play. With online classes it makes it so mush easier because you can get your work done early in the morning instead of waiting for school to start for you can go to class. Just think about the extra time that you could have.  Having classes with other people can be very distracting. In all your classes there's always going to be someone or something that is keeping you from focusing. At home you don't have to worry about anyone distracting you. With online classes you can do your work peacefully.  More schools should start offering distance learning to students. I believe that students would do better in school if they had online classes. Online classes gives them the chance to work alone and not be distracted by anything. Schools should allow students to choice if they want to take online classes. Everyone doesn't work at the same pace.		0
 Today, I would like to discuss the topic of student participation and academic requirements.  Many students express dissatisfaction with the current policy that requires a minimum grade of B to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. As a student, I believe that this policy is unfair and should be changed.  Dear principal, I urge you to reconsider the current policy of requiring a minimum grade of B to participate in sports or other extracurricular activities. This policy is not fair to all students, as some may have other responsibilities or challenges that make it difficult to maintain a B average. Additionally, many students believe that sports and other extracurricular activities are an important part of their education and personal development, and should be accessible to all students regardless of their academic standing.  In my opinion, the current policy is not fair to all students. Some students may have other responsibilities or challenges that make it difficult to maintain a B average. For example, some students may have to work part-time or take care of family members, which can make it difficult to maintain a high academic standing. Additionally, some students may have learning disabilities or other challenges that make it difficult to maintain a high grade point average.  Furthermore, many students believe that sports and other extracurricular activities are an important part of their education and personal development. Participating in sports and other extracurricular activities can help students develop important skills such as teamwork, leadership, and discipline. Additionally, these activities can be a fun and enjoyable way for students to socialize and make new friends.  In conclusion, I believe that the current policy of requiring a minimum grade of B to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities is unfair and should be changed. I urge the principal to reconsider this policy and make it more accessible to all students, regardless of their academic standing. Thank you for your attention to this matter.		1
Have you ever been told what your emotional expression is by a computer. A new software has been made that can recognize emotions. It has been made to develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.  First, it constructs a 3-D model of the face and the muscels in the software must move like human muscles. It makes an exact replica of your face and your face muscles. It shows you your emotion by using the location of your face muscles. For example in paragraph 3 it states," Your frontalis par leteralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you're surprised."  Second, It can tell you if you have mixed emotions. It can calculate exact emotions while we can partialy do this. In paragraph 5 it states that " You can probally tell how a freind is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc." The computer can show you this.  Third, The computer can help you by knowing what your emotion is. It can see when your happy looking at something so it can show you more stuff like that. It can see when your sad so it wont show you more stuff like that. It can see when your confused at something and so it can explain it to you differently so you wont be confused.  In conclusion, The computer constructs and exact replica of your face and your face muscles. It can tell you your exact emotion or mixed emotions. It can help you feel happy by showing you what you want to see and not showing you what you dont want to see. It can help teach you things that you differenly by showing it to you differently if it sees that you are confused. The technology to read a students expression in a classroom is valuable.		0
 Car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular in recent years. Many cities around the world have implemented traffic reduction programs and initiatives to create a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation system. These efforts have shown promising results, with reduced air pollution, decreased noise levels, and improved public health.  One example of a successful car-free city is Copenhagen, Denmark. The city has invested heavily in bike infrastructure, including bike lanes, bike parking, and bike rental stations. As a result, more than half of the city's residents commute to work by bike, and the city ranks highly in bike-related safety and comfort.  Another successful example is Barcelona, Spain. Barcelona implemented a congestion pricing policy, where drivers have to pay for driving in the city center during peak hours. This policy has resulted in a significant reduction in traffic in the city center and has encouraged the use of public transport and bikes.  Car-free cities have numerous benefits beyond just reducing traffic congestion. They also have the potential to improve public health. Research has shown that exposure to traffic and air pollution can lead to respiratory problems, heart disease, and other health issues. By removing cars from the city center, car-free cities can reduce these health risks and improve overall well-being.  Furthermore, car-free cities can also boost economic growth and tourism. With fewer cars on the road, businesses in the city center can focus on pedestrians and cyclists, creating more opportunities for tourism and local commerce.  In conclusion, car-free cities are an excellent solution to the current transportation challenges we face. They can reduce traffic congestion, improve public health, and boost economic growth. As more cities around the world implement car-free initiatives, we can work towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future.		1
Hey, so I'm gonna write this essay about honesty and stuff. Like, it's pretty important to be honest with your family and friends, you know? I mean, it's not cool to lie to them all the time, 'cause it can mess up your relationships and stuff.  First of all, let's talk about the advantages of being honest. When you're honest with your family and friends, they know they can trust you. Like, they know you're not gonna lie to them or try to trick them. And that's important, 'cause trust is like the foundation of any good relationship. If you can't trust someone, you don't wanna be friends with them. It's just not worth it.  And it's not just about trust, either. When you're honest, you feel better too. Like, you don't have to worry about keeping track of all your lies or trying to cover them up. You can just be yourself and be done with it. And that's gotta be a lot easier, right?  But there are also some disadvantages to being honest. Like, sometimes people don't wanna hear the truth. They might get mad at you or get upset, and then you're in a weird position where you're like, "Uh, sorry?" And that's not fun.  And sometimes, people might not believe you. Like, if you tell them something that's not true, they might not believe you even if you're being honest. And that's gotta be tough, 'cause you wanna be able to rely on people to believe you when you're telling the truth.  But even though there are some downsides to being honest, I think the benefits outweigh them. Like, when you're honest, you build trust and you feel better. And that's gotta be worth it, right?  So, in conclusion, honesty is important. Like, it's not always easy to be honest, but it's worth it in the long run. You gotta be able to rely on your family and friends, and they gotta be able to rely on you. And that's only gonna happen if you're honest with them.		1
Dear principle, work, work, work, you say you want us to try our best on projects but it is had without phones. There are clubs and plenty of other things to do after school. Without a phone if a club meeting is canceled we can still get a ride home. I think it would be sensible to let us bring phones to school.  A lot of kids are in clubs, if the club meeting is canceled then how are we going to get a ride home; the solution to that is to let us bring phones to school. If we can't bring phones to school then a lot of parents wouldn't let kids join after school clubs. You say that you don't want kids on the street, so if we have a phone we can join after school clubs, and not be on the street.  So without phones we can't join after school clubs. I learned that phones can be a problem, but can also help us out a lot to. So that is why phones should be aloud. So I believe that it would be in the best interest of us to let us have phones at school.  A concerned student		0
Dear Principal,  I am writing to express my thoughts on the proposed policy change that would require students to have at least a grade B average in order to participate in sports or other activities. While I understand the reasoning behind this policy, I believe that it would be unfair to many students who may struggle academically but excel in extracurricular activities.  Firstly, not all students are gifted academically, but they may possess talents in other areas such as sports or music. If this policy were to be implemented, it would deny these students the opportunity to showcase their skills and talents. This would be a great loss to the school and the community.  Secondly, extracurricular activities such as sports are a great way for students to learn important skills like teamwork, leadership, and time management. These skills are not only important in sports but also in life. If this policy is implemented, many students who are not doing well academically may lose out on the chance to develop these skills.  Lastly, extracurricular activities provide a great way for students to relieve stress and maintain their mental health. For some students, sports or other activities may be the only thing that keeps them going to school every day. If this policy were to be implemented, it would take away this outlet for many students and could potentially have a negative impact on their mental health.  In conclusion, I believe that this policy change would be unfair to many students who may struggle academically but excel in other areas. I urge you to reconsider this policy and find other ways to motivate students to improve their grades without taking away their opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
As a student, I think it is a great idea for kids to participate in an extracurricular activity. The reason I say this is because children need to be more active, social with people and peers, and also should take pride in their school and community. An extracurricular can help students become more interactive and confident when encountering with the society.  One extracurricular activity you can participate in would be a sport. Over the course of years students have became more obsessed, which also can mean less active. Being obsessed can affect a persons health. In the last five years children ranging of ages 10-17 have became more and more less active. So by playing a sport you can become more active and healthier. However sports can help with more than activity. When playing a sport, you will want to get better at a objective in the game. When you are wanting to get better that is known as a goal. When having goals you are having to work harder to reach for that specific accomplishment. Setting goals while not only help you in sports but also in the future.  Helping with school yearbooks is another extracurricular activity. Doing yearbooks can mean a lot to your school because your are taking pride in your school. Taking pride in your school can mean a lot because it not only makes the school look good it makes you look good as a person. If you are doing yearbooks that means you are creative and have good unique ways of doing things. Being creative and able to¬†think of new ideas can mean a lot in your future also because many businesses are looking for people who can bring big and better ideas to the table.  Lastly, being a student council takes a lot of responsibility and respect. Having this extracurricular activity you never know who you will or may encounter on a daily. When being a student council you should always try your best to be professional. Being social is another main concept¬†because you are talking to people all the time. So being a student council takes a lot of effort and respect.  As a result, I think it is a good idea to let kids have extracurricular activities. These activities will help children be more interactive and prepared for the future. Helping students be more successful and active will help are society. Therefore, kids need to get good grades in order to take part in these activities. If you play a sport and your grades aren't good then your chances are lower to go to college for that specific sport. You could be the best leader, player, artist, or even have the best ideas but if you don't have good grades a college most likely won't except you. However, I think having extracurricular activities would really make students more confident and prepared for the society.¬†		0
In the matter of the electoral college, being either abolished or kept intact, i take the side of keeping it intact for the reason that even though you are technically not voting for the president, but for a slate of delegates that are loyal to the candidate, it is in fact very useful. First, the number of electoral votes are given by the population of each state, and second, there is a near certanty of a outcome because of the winner take all system.  To begin with, the electoral college is based on the population of the state, meaning, that the bigger the state population, the more electoral college represantitives they get. So, if California has the biggest population in the U.S, and the district of Columbia has the smallest, then it isn't fair that they get the same number of votes, either small nor large, because there are more people in one state then the other. Although people say that the electoral college is a bad thing, and think that it is an anarchism, it is not, for it is one of the things that keep our counntry in near perfect shape.  Another reason that the Electoral College should be kept, is that there is a near certainty of a outcome. Take the 2012 election between Obama and Romney, where Obama recieved 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to the 51.3% populatrity vote cast to him. People argue that the electora l college has a diaster factor, or that the system allows for much more to happen that doesn't. Thats the problem. It hasn't happened and most likely won't happen, because if were going to happen then it would've already happened and Congress wouldve revised it and made sure that it didnt happen or that it could be delayed so that a solution was made possible, and that the election went as continued.  To conclude, even though the electoral college has many flaws that are yet to be shown and or fixed, it is the only way we have to elect presidents, and thats how it should be, because you can't have a perfect thing without flaws that have to be fixed    		0
As the threat of global warming becomes more imminent, it is increasingly important to find ways to conserve energy and resources. Doing so can help reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. There are numerous benefits associated with conserving energy and resources. These include reduced costs and environmental damage, improved public health, and increased reliability of the energy supply.  At the same time, there are some disadvantages to conserving energy and resources. One of the most significant is that the transition away from traditional energy sources can be challenging and costly. In addition, government regulations and other initiatives may result in higher costs for businesses and consumers in the short term.  To effectively conserve energy and resources, it is essential to have a plan. This plan should incorporate existing and emerging technologies, as well as economic and political factors. It should strive to reduce waste and promote energy efficiency. Examples of such plans include providing incentives for energy-efficient appliances and vehicles, incentivizing renewable energy production, and encouraging public transportation. In addition, it is important to promote education about the importance of conserving energy and resources throughout the population. Together, these measures will help ensure we have a sustainable energy and resource system for the future.		1
In todays world we have trains, city buses, charter buses, bicycles, and ferry boats.¬† With all of these available transportation services there is no need to own or use a personal car.¬† Without personal cars you would be saving money, saving our ecosystem, and decreasing traffic congestion.  To begin, by limiting the usage of personal cars you are allowing yourself to save a tramendous amount of money.¬† With most average cars you fill the gas on it almost twice a week Which could cost upwards to 100 dollars a week. That is just about 50,000 dollars a year just on gas!¬† You also have to worry about servicing your car every once and a while, which you also pay for.¬† This isn't even including the down payments you put on the car or monthly payments.¬† When most cities offer a bus pass for about twenty-five dollars a month top ride it as much as you want within the time that it is valid.¬† For these reasons alone there is just no benefits to owning or using a personal car.  By eliminating the usage of personal cars you will be saving our ecosystem.¬† According to source 1 "passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."¬† In certain parts of the United States gas emissions from personal cars make up half of all the polution going into the green house effect.¬† If you just take a city bus or train you are not only saving the worlds atmosphere but you are also saving you pockets.  Finally, if you are someone that gets up and early and drives to work and hits morning rush hour that is because you all have somewhere to be.¬† So instead of having one person in each car why not save time and reduce traffic by taking a bus that holds upwardas to thirty people.¬† Also with less cars on the road the less chances you have to getting in an accident.¬† By reducing personal car usage you will be getting to work on time and saving yourself from potential harm.  To conclude, without the usage of personal cars you will be saving money, the ecosystem, and reducing traffic congestion.    		0
Extracurricular activities are very important to not only your success at school but also your success in life. Not only does being in a club or sport help you grow, it also affects how colleges and bosses see you as a person. Participating in extracurricular activities can open many doors such as, acquiring new skills, becoming a more well rounded person, and meeting new people which can also lead to new opportunities.  In life your going to meet many people, some will stick with you and some won't, but you will learn something from each and everyone of them. Extracurricular activities will lead you to meet all of the different people in your school that may share some of the same interest as you. For example maybe a student decides to join the lacrosse team and none of your friends do. The student ends up meeting lots of people who also like trucks and fishing and hunting. If the student would not have participated an extracurricular activity, they would have never met their new friends. Another way doing clubs and sports will help you is the teachers or coaches getting to know you. For instance say an eight grader joins the art club, the art teacher never really knew you before. But, since you have been going to the club the whole year, the art teacher loves your attitude and thinks you are very talented . Then you are picking you classes for high school and you want to do a photography class, but you need you are teachers recommendation. The student that was in¬†the club is more likely to get a recommendation than the kid who just took art. Meeting new people who also may give you new opportunities is a essential and will help throughout life.  Accumulating a new skill happens almost everyday to everybody. A skill can range from a way to write a story to a new way to shoot a basketball. In life you obtain so many skills and being in different clubs or activities can help you¬†share them among many people. For example, a student joins the yearbook club. The student has never really been very good with computers, but is really good with cameras. Many of the students who are in that club are great at editing, but dont have great camera skills. With both of the student skills put together they work perfectly, but also the can teach the skills to one another. Another skill that is¬†acquired through any club or sport you decide to do is, how to interact with others. There are many shy people but also many loud people. A shy person can view a very actively talking person and find new skill and maybe they wont be as shy because they know how to start a conversation and since they are in a extracurricular activities with people that share the same interest as them, they will be able to talk about club related subjects. Lastly, someone can learn how to play a sport. A large number of people play a sport, but usually not every sport. So, a student could give a different sport you don't play a shot. Maybe there is a student that runs track, swims, plays soccer and field hockey. But, they decide to play volleyball. Since they are required to do a club or sport they made this decision, but if they were not required to they most likely would have not tried anything new. Once they started playing the learned many skills and ended up being one of the best on the team. Making extracurricular activities mandatory could be beneficial to a lot¬†of students and might even help hem find their true talent.  A well-rounded human being can have different definitions, but usually it means someone who can balance. Not the kind of balance of standing or walking across a tightrope, but more like having loads of work¬†to do and getting it done quickly and quietly. It also means to be someone who helps others, which can range from friends to your whole community. At some schools there is Student Council Association and Youth Volunteer Corps. Both Student Council Association¬†and Youth Volunteer Corps help the community and are extracurricular activities. These two clubs usually have people that are caring and want to help others in it, but they¬†also have good grades and manage to do¬†other activities. Another way student are well rounded is when they have multiple friends. While they usually have a few close friends they are also friendly and easily can make friends with anyone who sits with them. With extracurricular activities they could make even more friends or just be nice¬†to someone¬†new. They could also share their actions with new people who might decide¬†to be more like the well rounded student. Finally, they can be friends with the teachers. To build a relationship with the teacher you can join a club that is run by a teacher. It is hard to talk to teachers during class and get to know them. But, once it is the club time and they can talk to a student with fewer people and where the don't have to teach, the student can actually get to know the teacher. This can be helpful in many way, they can understand your way of learning and be able to help you better and like what was mentioned before they can help with a recommendation for school or¬†even maybe a job. Without extracurricular activities people wouldnt be able to be as well rounded as they could potentially be because they wouldn't be able to connect with others.  Extracurricular activities could help so many people in all kinds of ways. While their could be some problems with depletion of time, obtaining the skill or even the amount of school work they have to do after. There is ways around those kind of problems and they could easily be fixed. Joining clubs and sports teams can be very beneficial to everyone involved and learning new skills, meeting new people and becoming a well rounded person is just a few reasons to make extracurricular activities mandatory.		0
Some schools are offering distance learning for students to attend class from home. With online or video conferencing . I support thus idea of distance classes Because you can wake up anytime you want, Go in a slow speed to no overwhelm yourself, no one can bother you while you study.  First of you can wake up anytime you want so you can have the right amount of hours in case you work at night and you dont get seven to nine hours of sleep every night. Also you can do classes later in the day in case you want to work in the morning instead of the night. So you can have a career and have time to study to make your future come closer. It's also a good thing for people that have to stay home to look at after their sick parents or little brothers they won't have to worry at school if they are okay because they will be home taking classes and making sure everything is okay while studying.  Therefore they won't be overwhelmed about missing days or which classes he needs to make up a test or if he/she has a project coming up in class because all of that info is going to be in his/her phone or laptop. Its a better thing to have online classes doesn't take up half of your day you dont get overwhelmed with new info for like 4 different classes in one day. So you wont be stressed out as much that (study shows most kids that drop out is because they are being stressed out with so many info in just one day for like 4 different blocks in a single day). Online classes are better from what i heard it help's you better cause it teaches you what the state want's you to know instead of things you dont need to know like some side stories that teachers say to make you try to remember but end up getting lost in the story.  Finally when you do your work no one can bother you about the answer or what problem you in and they cant cheat off of you and you end up getting in trouble because they didnt stop asking or taking to you. Its also a good thing because if you don't¬†understand you can go back a lesson to relearn it again in case you forgot how to do the problem. thats why Online classes are more proffered then actual class when you have to wake up early and go to school all tired cause you only slept a little staying up because of work or studding for the next unit so you cant fall behind or re doing a new untie while going into a new one. So i support the idea of distance learning for students and that schools are thinking about doing it would be a great idea.		0
School is very important in our lives, in fact we pretty much need school to succeed in life. I know most students hate waking up in the morning and catching the bus everyday, it gets annoying after awhile. Also some students just do not cope well with teachers. Distance learning or learning from home would be a great way for students to learn and stay focus without having a teacher on their back all the time. They are also in a comfortable environment by being at home as opposed to being in school with kids they barely know, now lets get into more depth about this.  Some students do not like listening to teachers, they think they are always telling them what to do. Most students do not like that, and they get defensive and start arguing and as grown adults teachers are not going to let adolescent boys and girls yell at them so they yell back, it is just human nature to do so. So to avoid pointless confrontation on a daily basis just let the student be at home while learning there is no telling the student what to do, no share with the class, and no asking when to use the bathroom just straight learning.  Also students hate waking up early just to catch a bus, school should be able to start anytime of the day not just the morning time. A lot of kids miss the bus a lot too which causes them to be late and get a tardy. With some school policies if a lot of tardies add up it can lead to a referral and who wants one of those just for being a couple of minutes late or even a suspension which causes you to miss school anyway isn't that dumb. Now if you were at home learning you would not have to go through any of that because you can start your lesson on your own time. sounds great to be at home right.  You would not have to deal with administration either, that is a big one lets be honest kids are going to be kids especially boys so horseplay is going to come in to action. With administration in the building though kids cannot do that the administration is going to stop them some might even give a referral just because they have that position of power and will use it to their advantage. If you are at home though you can do whatever you want without anyone telling what to do besides your parents, but most parents cut slack on their kids because they know how their kids are. So lets avoid all of the drama and make everyone lives easier.  In conclusion, distance learning seems to be a better and easier way for teachers and students to communicate with each other. Most kids would rather be at home anyways they could play video games for a hour and learn a new formula the next hour. Distance learning is the way to go you will see everyone much happier with themselves and everything more easy going So online teaching sounds just about right.		0
Finishing high school in three years is an intriguing proposition that has gained significant traction in the last few years. On the one hand, completion ahead of schedule is an attractive concept to many students who are eager to begin college and make an impact on the world. Additionally, many students are self-directed and mature enough to handle the rigors of completing high school early. On the other hand, however, there are a few potential drawbacks to consider. The most significant concern is that students may miss out on important experiences, such as extracurricular activities or even friendships, if they leave high school too quickly. Furthermore, without these experiences, students may struggle to develop the very skills necessary for academic and professional success.   Overall, whether or not completing high school in three years is a good idea is a decision that will vary from person to person. While it may be a great option for certain individuals who are ready to move on to the next phase of their lives, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and ensure that students are still able to enjoy and benefit from the high school experience.		1
I think that policy 1 sounds like a good idea but i would suggest a tip to having your phone on vibrate. Now you have to think is having a cell phone that bad as long as it off during your classes to stop causes of distraction. A majority of kids who have a cell phone use it during school regardless if it's restrictive or not. So allowing it in school couldn't make it any worse because to have to stop a class to take a phone away or even arguing with a kid to see if they were using it or not would make it stop most likely. They would be able to check or take a phone call out of class instead of in a class room were kids are trying to learn. Policy 2 on the other hand would make things worse because some kids parents and single parents work late and when they come home with no phone or maybe even key incase of a emergency.		0
 Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel. With the increasing focus on safety and technology, driverless cars are becoming more and more popular. In this essay, we will discuss some of the benefits and challenges of driverless cars.  One of the main benefits of driverless cars is the increased safety. These cars use advanced sensors, cameras, and machine learning algorithms to detect obstacles and make driving decisions in real-time. This eliminates the risk of human error, which is a major cause of accidents on the road. Additionally, driverless cars can communicate with each other, reducing the likelihood of accidents caused by miscommunication between drivers.  Another benefit of driverless cars is increased productivity. Without the need to focus on driving, passengers can use their time for other tasks, such as reading, working, or relaxing. This is especially beneficial for those who have long commutes or work in professions that require a lot of concentration, such as doctors or lawyers.  However, there are also some challenges associated with driverless cars. One of the main challenges is the cost of the technology. Driverless cars require a lot of expensive equipment, such as sensors and cameras, which can drive up the price of the vehicles. This may make them less accessible to the general public, who may not be able to afford the higher cost.  Another challenge of driverless cars is the potential for job loss. As driverless cars become more common, there may be a decrease in demand for human drivers, particularly in industries such as taxi and trucking. This could lead to job loss and increased unemployment in these sectors.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to bring a lot of benefits to society, including increased safety and productivity. However, there are also challenges associated with the technology, such as cost and job loss. As driverless cars become more common, it will be important to address these challenges to ensure that the technology is accessible and beneficial for everyone.		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the president of the United States by popular vote.  The Electoral College is a system that awards electoral votes to each state based on its population, with each state having a minimum of three electors. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska, which award electoral votes by congressional district.  This system has been in place since the United States was founded, but it is no longer relevant in today's society. The Electoral College gives disproportionate power to small states, and it often results in the election of a president who did not win the popular vote.  In the 2016 presidential election, for example, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College and became president. This is not the first time that this has happened. In the 2000 election, George W. Bush won the Electoral College even though Al Gore won the popular vote by more than 500,000 votes.  The Electoral College is unfair to voters in states that are not considered to be "swing states." In these states, the candidates know that they have no chance of winning, so they do not bother to campaign there. This means that the voters in these states have no real say in who becomes president.  The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus on winning a few key states, rather than trying to appeal to voters across the country. This is because the Electoral College system gives all of the electoral votes in a state to the candidate who wins the popular vote in that state. This means that a candidate can win the presidency by winning a few key states, even if they lose the popular vote overall.  The Electoral College is a flawed system that no longer serves the needs of the American people. It is time to abolish the Electoral College and elect the president of the United States by popular vote.  I urge you to support this important reform.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
 In recent years, there has been a significant amount of progress made in the development of driverless cars. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we travel and make our cities safer and more efficient. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of driverless cars and some of the challenges that need to be addressed in order for this technology to become widely adopted.  One of the main benefits of driverless cars is the increased safety they provide. Human error is the cause of a majority of accidents on the road, and with driverless cars, this risk is significantly reduced. The cars are equipped with sensors and cameras that allow them to detect obstacles and potential hazards, and the onboard computer can take control of the vehicle to prevent an accident. Additionally, driverless cars are designed to communicate with each other and with traffic systems to reduce congestion and improve flow.  Another benefit of driverless cars is the increased efficiency they provide. With no need for a human driver, the cars can navigate traffic more smoothly and travel at a faster pace. This can reduce the time people spend commuting and improve productivity. Additionally, driverless cars can be designed to be more fuel-efficient, further reducing their impact on the environment.  Despite these benefits, there are several challenges that need to be addressed in order for driverless cars to become widely adopted. One of the main challenges is the high cost of the technology. While the cost of the technology itself is decreasing, the cost of installing the necessary infrastructure, such as cameras and sensors, is still relatively high. Additionally, there is a need for ongoing maintenance and updates to the software to ensure that the cars are safe and reliable.  Another challenge is the need for public acceptance of the technology. While many people are excited about the potential of driverless cars, there are also concerns about job loss and safety. It will be important for car manufacturers and policymakers to address these concerns and work to build public trust in the technology.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel and make our cities safer and more efficient. While there are several challenges that need to be addressed in order for this technology to become widely adopted, the benefits are significant. With continued investment and innovation, it is likely that driverless cars will become a common sight on the roads in the not-too-distant future.		1
 Car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular, and for good reason. With the rise of pollution, traffic congestion, and health problems related to air pollution, many people are looking for alternative ways to get around. Here are some of the benefits of car-free cities:  1. Reduced air pollution: One of the main benefits of car-free cities is the reduced air pollution. Cars are a major contributor to air pollution, and by reducing the number of cars on the roads, cities can improve the air quality for their residents.  2. Reduced traffic congestion: Car-free cities can also help reduce traffic congestion. With fewer cars on the roads, there is less traffic and fewer delays. This can lead to shorter commute times and a more efficient transportation system.  3. Improved public health: In addition to the benefits of reduced air pollution and traffic congestion, car-free cities can also improve the public health. Walking or cycling instead of driving can lead to a healthier lifestyle, with regular physical activity and fresh air.  4. Increased economic benefits: Car-free cities can also have economic benefits. With fewer cars on the roads, there will be less infrastructure needed for roads and parking, which can save money. Additionally, cities can invest in other forms of transportation, such as public transportation or bike-sharing programs, which can create jobs and encourage economic growth.  5. Better community engagement: Finally, car-free cities can help foster a sense of community engagement. By encouraging walking and cycling, residents can interact with each other and get to know their neighbors better. This can help create a stronger sense of community and social cohesion.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer many benefits, including reduced air pollution, less traffic congestion, improved public health, economic benefits, and better community engagement. As our world becomes more sustainable, more and more cities may consider becoming car-free.		1
 Employers are always looking for specific qualities in potential employees. These qualities include being responsible and doing a good job. However, many times, employers look for people who have experience, even if they don't have the necessary qualifications. Many people seek employment opportunities without experience, hoping to learn new skills and improve their lives. In many cases, employers make hiring decisions based on a person's ability to perform the job, even if they don't have experience.  Firstly, most people do not have the opportunity to study because they are not working or don't have the financial means to pay for it. Employers can offer new opportunities for people to gain experience and improve their lives. When employees work hard, employers are pleased, and this can lead to opportunities for growth and advancement. For example, employees who work hard and demonstrate their potential may be given more responsibilities or a raise.  Secondly, being responsible is an important quality that can lead to opportunities for growth and advancement. Employers value employees who take their work seriously and are accountable for their actions. Employers also appreciate employees who are respectful and have good manners. These qualities are essential for success in any job and can help employees stand out from the competition.  Some may argue that people without experience cannot work, as they may have a bad conduct or lack the necessary skills. However, employers often misjudge people based on their lack of experience. Many people are eager to learn and improve their skills, and working can provide them with the opportunity to do so. Employers should consider a person's potential, rather than their lack of experience, when making hiring decisions.  In conclusion, many people need opportunities to showcase their potential and improve their lives. Employers should consider a person's ability to perform the job and their potential for growth and advancement, rather than their lack of experience.

 Introduction: The planet Mars is home to several unique and fascinating features, including the Face on Mars. While some people believe that the Face is a creation of extraterrestrial beings, there is strong evidence to suggest that it is a natural landform. In this essay, I will present arguments and evidence to prove that the Face on Mars is simply a natural formation.  Body: The Face on Mars is a large, flat area located in the northern hemisphere of the planet. Some observers have described it as a giant face looking back at Earth. However, a closer examination of the region reveals that it is simply a massive valley formed by the erosion of volcanic lava. The Face is surrounded by craters and volcanic formations, which are consistent with its geological origin.  Furthermore, geologists at NASA have analyzed satellite images of the Face and found no signs of activity or movement that would be indicative of a biological or artificial presence. In fact, the Face appears to be completely inert and lifeless, which is consistent with the idea that it is a natural formation.  Finally, scientists have discovered a large amount of water ice in the area surrounding the Face, which is an unusual feature for a volcanic region. The water ice is likely to be a result of the planet's thin atmosphere and the presence of water-ice asteroids that hit Mars in the past. The water ice is also consistent with the idea that the Face is a natural landform, as it would be formed by the action of water over time.  Conclusion: In conclusion, there is strong evidence to suggest that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. The Face's flat, volcanic shape is consistent with its geological origin, and there is no evidence of activity or movement that would indicate an extraterrestrial presence. Additionally, the discovery of water ice in the region is consistent with the idea that the Face is a natural landform. While some people may continue to speculate about the Face's origins, the preponderance of evidence suggests that it is simply a unique and fascinating geological feature on the planet Mars.		1
Over the last two decades, cell phones have become very popular. Today, almost everyone has a cell phone, especially if they are old enough to drive. Cell phone use while driving has become a big controversy over the last few years and many people have faced the consequences of texting, calling, or searching their cell phones while operating a vehicle. With that being said, there are several reasons why people should not use their phones while driving. These reasons can be classified into a couple of different categories, including safety and legal reasons.  The first reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in injury or death for the driver or someone else. This could pose a safety hazard and would therefore fall under the safety category. Statistically, there are 1.6 million car crashes that are caused by texting and driving each year. Almost 390,000 injuries each year from accidents involve a cell phone or other device. Also, 1 out of every 4 car accidents are caused by texting and driving in the U.S. Therefore, there is always a risk that an accident will happen as a result of cell phone use and could harm anyone involved in the accident.  The second reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in property damage for the driver or someone else, which could pose a safety hazard but could also result in someone pressing charges. Therefore, this could be classified under the safety category and the legal category. As mentioned above, crashes due to cell phone use while driving are very common in the United States. It can cause damage to other vehicles, houses, and or company buildings. Whatever your insurance doesn't cover you have to pay out of pocket and these damages can get really expensive. Any insurance claim could also cause your monthly payments to go up.  The last reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it is against the law in many states such as Georgia, which would fall under the legal category. On July 1, 2018, Georgia passed a Hands-Free law that basically says that anyone driving a motor vehicle on a highway in Georgia is not allowed to hold a phone with any part of their bodies. A first-time offense for using a cell phone and driving is $50, the second is $100, and the third is $150. Each offense after the third one is also $150 each. Every offense is a misdemeanor that would go on your permanent record.  There are multiple reasons why you should not use your phone while driving. This distracted driving can lead to car wrecks that could cause harm to you, to someone in your car, or to anyone else involved in the accident. An accident could also cause damage to your car, to someone else's car, or to homes, buildings, and other property damage. It is also illegal in many other states so if you are caught you could be fined up to $150 and it would go on your permanent record. Because of these potential safety hazards and legal issues, it is best to not use a cell phone while driving a vehicle.   		0
The author explains to us how worthy it is to study Venus for example in the articel he claimes that Venus has so many features like earth for example like an ocean or a mountain he alos said there could even be some type of life form that could live there. There has been more and more people wanting to study this because of the fact that this one day might become another earth that we can live on and form some type of life on there but people have to test it out to see if we are able to live there for example to see if any animal life form can live there or even start bringing other to Venus for some testing. The big issue though is that the tempture gets really high like around 800 degrees for example it siads that "Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volecanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightn skrikes to probes seeking to land on its surface." For example in paragraph 5 it saids " The National Aeronautics and space administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. NASA's possible solutions to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Vesusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms , a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of there way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface , temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be plentiful,and radiation would notexceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable enough for humans."  l		0
When you go out in the streets have you ever seen a driverless car? Are you safe with letting your children in the streets knowing there is a car with no need of a driver to drive it? well , i dont argue with driverless cars. Why would anyone want a driveless car that still needs a driver?  One of the reasons for not agreeing with the driverless car is safety. Safety is a big part the world and specially in the streets. There really is no need for driverless cars because in the paragragh it says " In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless " The human driver must remain alert an be ready to take over when the situation requires. If its a driverless car we dont need to pay attention because it would be driving on it own. Yet, the car still needs our help in situations it can't do it self.  Also, it says in the paragraph " Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert driver." So, when driving a driverless car you dont have to steer, accelerate, and brake. But you have to still pay attention. Driverless cars should not be allowed in the streets, An malfunction can happen at any second on the road an whos to blame? The driver or the driverless car? "The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge," admits Dr. Werner HUber, a BMW project manager driver. Theres always gonna be a challenge but we dont need more of a challenge when something isnt working in our driverless car.  Lastly, Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Which mean driverless cars are not safe, i mean not all cars are safe but really think about it , would you want you child out in the streets knowing the law is letting driverless car drive around? Because i know my children wouldnt be out. As a result , in most states it is illegal even to tesr computer driven cars. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe. Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault?  My conclusion is that driverless cars should not be allowed on the streets because of safety reasons , and failures on streets. Nobody knows when, where, and at what time an accident can happen due to driverless cars. All cars always needs to be driven by a human not a computer. Laws are made for human drivers not computers.		0
Freedom to chose our leader is nothing more than an illusion. Voters have absolutely no saying in who shall take their place on the presidential seat. This is what the Electoral College does. It is an archaic system and unreliable system in which the whole of the presidential election is decided by the bias of the few whom are "pledged" to a certain party but at the end can choose whoever the like the most. This is not the Democracy we so dearly hold in our hearts like Americans and it goes well against the principles our forefathers taught us as free pople. Undeniably the Electoral College negates any concept of the democracy of America, making the impotance of the will of the people meaningless and nothing more than an illusion.  Deep into our history is the recaunting of how such a terrible system as the Electoral College came to be. It was originally a settlement on the dispute of how the president should be elected, either by the people or by Congress. Now the first option would have been the perfect one, but there are always those who would firts dei to loose their power to the pople of our country. And the clash of interest was so large it could have broken the nation in two as we have seen happened a few times in history. As such a great many years have passed since this whole argument and at every election poeple are realizing the faults of this flawed concept. At its core the system is Useless. It is the most antidemocratic idea ever to have been in practice and one that still is in use. It overpowers the will of millions with the will of a few hundred. That is why such a monster should be abolished.  The year is 2000. Al Gore and George W. Bush clash for the seat in the white house. The election draws to an end and the votes are counted. There is a clear discrepancy in the votes, making Al Gore the winner, and by all means, the next president of the United States of America. But somewhere else there's also a clear discrepancy. Back at the Electoral College the counting says Bush won against Al Gore even though Al had already won the poeple of America. On that election 5 pople choose the fate of an entire nation. 5 people only. Such a thing is outrageous, and we are lucky it hasn't happened again nor more frequently. But thing is it shouldn't happen at all. That's ehy the POEPLE should choose insted of 538 what'stheirfaces. This endevour proves one thing and one thing only.  Unreliability. It is illogical that one wins the masses of the common citizens but looses because of five well dressed ones.  The Electoral College is a monster. A wild dice which at one moment can favor you and at the next one destroy you. This isn't how America works.		0
Have you ever wondered what are some of the true dangers of exploring Venus? Venus is a broiling hot planet due to it being the second farthest planet from the Sun, which is our closest star.  Scientists have created multiple technological devices, but have they created enough for them to explore planets, such as Venus. Did you know people say Venus is a female planet.  In case the reader has not yet figured it out, this essay is about the planet in our solar system known as Venus.  Venus has a bad reputation and for a pretty good reason. No spaceship has ever landed there, neither has a space craft and survived for more than a few hours. This is because of the toxic gases that suround Venus. Its been three decades, thirty years, since scientists attempted to try to land another spaceship on Venus. This is because those toxic gases that suround Venus are ninety-seven percent of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acids, which is deadly for any living organisms' lungs from planet Earth. Planet Venus's toxic atmosphere makes it difficult for us humans to explore Venus.  Venus has many other dangers to explore this planet as well. Weather, Natural Diasters beyond what Earth's people has ever seen, heat, and its's atomospheric pressure. Venus may be farther away from the Sun by Mercury is the first closest planet to the Sun and is cooler than Venus. Venus's average temperature is over eight-hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any other planet in our entire solar system. Venus has an atmospheric pressure that is ninety times greater than what we experience on Earth, our home planet. Venusian geology shows Venus has natural diasters including erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequently occuring lighting strikes. The lighting could easily get to Venus's surface.  Venus has many other dangers to explore this planet as well. Weather, Natural Diasters beyond what Earth's people has ever seen, heat, and its's atomospheric pressure. Venus may be farther away from the Sun by Mercury is the first closest planet to the Sun and is cooler than Venus. Venus's average temperature is over eight-hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any other planet in our entire solar system. Venus has an atmospheric pressure that is ninety times greater than what we experience on Earth, our home planet. Venusian geology shows Venus has natural diasters including erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequently occuring lighting strikes. The lighting could easily get to Venus's surface.  Despite these life-threatening dangers for scientists, it would amazing to explore Venus because it is something no human has ever done before. 1st sentence. It would be a worthy pursuit for sure. It would also be a lot of hard work just to discover how any human would be able to survive landing on Venus to explore it. It would be amazing as well to do something like this because future generations of people would know if they believe and work hard enough that they can do anything they set their mind to do. Anything is possible.  This essay was on Venus, a very dangerous planet. Venus is a dangerous planet becaus Venus is toxic. Venus is also full of hot weather and natural diasters. Those natural diasters are much more extreme than anything Earth has experienced or the people on Earth has and will ever see. Mercury is even cooler than Venus and Mercury is even closer to the Sun. Venus is a dangerous planet, but it would be well worth being able to finally explore.      		0
What has the work come to? When parents and grandparents were young, no one would have ever dreamed of such a thing. A driverless car is something that not many people thought they would see happening in their life time. Technology is going farther and farther.  They call it "catching up to the dream." Technology is starting to do some amazing things, but also doing some not so good things. Everyone always hears their parents or grandparents say " We didn't have that when I was a kid." The sad part is, it's true. Technology has come a long way since they were younger. They didn't use to have phones, gameboys, Xbox, or anything kids have now. In 2000 they did not have the technology to make a driverless car, but now in 2016. We do, we have all the technology needed. In fact we have too much technology. It's what our society runs on. Driverless cars will be a big hit, sadly.  It's amazing what people have come up with. Touch screens, cars with built-in wifi, cars that can stop themselves if in danger, and now driverless cars. A driverless car would be amazing if you're too tired to drive, but it could also lead to many accidents. People keep forgetting that technology can fail. If that technology fails, you could be in some serious danger. They say the car will have a way to keep you alert. The only way to be alert is if you're in control. People are getting lazy and this proves it. Everyone around the world have been driving for years upon years. They did not have any problems with it. If we were to tell our grandparents about a driverless car, you better bet they would go crazy and give you the speach about "when they were young..." for the hundredth time. I can agree that it's crazy. We should be at the point to let technology control everything. One day it may go to far. By then I hope I'm my grandparents age to give the speach about how it was when I was younger. Technology can be a great thing when it comes to researched. Technology can also be a bad thing because it's taking over and kids now have iPhones at 6 years old. They should be outside with water balloons or playing ball.  Driverless cars aren't a good idea. That's just another thing to show kids how to not be kids. Honestly, let technology stay where its at for a little longer. I'm a teenager and I dread the day technology is all people car about. I know parents that are on their phones more than their kids and their kids would give anything for their parents to ask how their day was or even talk to them. Driverless cars is just another thing that will lead to more and more lazy things. I rather actually have to learn to drive than to have a car drive for me. What's the fun in that? There is none.  I know people will keep making bigger and "better" things, but a driverless car will cause more wrecks than there already is. Which means mor lives that will be taken. Technology fails. Driverless cars can too.		0
 I have always been fascinated by the art of singing, and I believe that joining a chorus class would be an excellent way for me to improve my skills and express my passion for music. By participating in a chorus class, I can practice my singing abilities, learn from other talented singers, and perform in front of an audience.  I understand that to fully enjoy the chorus class, I need to have a solid foundation of singing skills. Therefore, I plan to stay after school to practice more and seek help from the teacher or other students when necessary. I believe that consistent practice and dedication are crucial to achieving my singing goals.  Moreover, I believe that learning from others is an essential aspect of the chorus class. If I encounter a skill or technique that I am unfamiliar with, I can ask my fellow singers for guidance. I can also observe their singing style and incorporate it into my own to improve my own performance.  Finally, I understand that performing in front of a large audience can be intimidating, especially for someone who is new to singing in public. However, I believe that with enough practice and exposure, I can overcome my fears and become a confident performer.  In conclusion, joining a chorus class would be an excellent opportunity for me to develop my singing skills, learn from other talented singers, and perform in front of an audience. I am excited to embark on this journey and see how far I can go in the world of music.		1
I think policy 2 is better because many student would just brake the rule of keeping your phone turned off during class, so if their going to brake the rule might as well not let them use it during school. These days student are just always on their phone and they aren't trying hard enough in school, either because they are distracted to much, or they are just spending their time on their phone chatting with their friends. The principle should banned student from using phones during school is in session until the principle sees the students test scores are getting higher up. Not allowing student to use their phone during school is a great idea because now students are going to be more focused on school studies then just spending their time on their phone. Phones are a great invention but I think it would be better to keep them out of schools for the students education. Most parent's of students would probably agree with me. I consider phones distractions inside of a school campus. If I were to go to school and offer a student a phone, or an education the student would most likely choose the phone. My opinion is that the most important thing a student should get is a education, but if they cant get it because a phone is more important to them then i think that is just sad. Most people in the United States would consider a phone a distraction for the mind of a student.		0
