 The cowboy who rode the waves is a captivating symbol of the Wild West's adventurous spirit. This cowboy is not just a rider of horses, but a rider of the waves, a fearless surfer who rode the waves with ease and confidence. This cowboy's unique lifestyle and mindset made him a standout among his peers.  The cowboy's journey to becoming a professional surfer began in California, where surfing was a popular culture. From a young age, he was fascinated by the surfers' graceful movements on the water and their ability to conquer the waves. He was determined to become a surfer like them, and he spent years studying the ocean currents, wave patterns, and techniques.  As he grew older, his passion for surfing only grew stronger. He spent every spare moment out on the water, honing his skills, and learning from various surfing instructors. His dedication paid off, and he quickly became a skilled surfer, able to ride the waves with ease and confidence.  The cowboy's transition into becoming a professional surfer was not an easy one. In the beginning, he faced many challenges and setbacks. Some people were dismissive of his dream, believing that he did not belong on the water. Others told him that he was too old to become a professional surfer, too set in his ways, and incapable of learning the ropes.  However, the cowboy remained steadfast in his pursuit of happiness, determined to become a successful surfer. He persisted through the challenges, believing in himself and his abilities. Eventually, his hard work paid off, and he became a respected member of the surfing community.  The cowboy's unique lifestyle and mindset made him a standout among his peers. He was a cowboy in the truest sense of the word - proud, rugged, and independent-minded. However, he also had a laid-back, carefree attitude that was perfect for the relaxed, carefree lifestyle of a professional surfer.  His journey from cowboy to surfer highlights the fluidity of identity and the importance of following your passions. It teaches us that anything is possible if we are willing to work hard, believe in ourselves, and persist through setbacks. Ultimately, it is the cowboy who rode the waves that will forever be known as a true adventurer, brave enough to face the unknown and embrace the beauty of the world around him.		1
Dear principal,  I would prefer if you choose policy 1.  The reason why I would like policy 1, is because we are never aloud to have our phones out at the school day; although a lot of kids do anyway. I would like it because i would be at lunch and free times and what's the big deal about that? It's not like we would be hurting anybody. the only trouble would be if you dropped it and someone stepped on it, or if you left it on the table and somebody took it. Although if someone took it would be your fault.  For an example what if you forgot your gym clothes or your lunch money? If you had your cell phone then you would be able to call a mom or dad or anybody to pick up your stuff and bring it to the school. Or if you had an F in a certain class, and you left your project that would get you a B in that class, you could call someone to drop it off.  The bad thing about it though is that you probably never be concentrated on any of your classes or maybe just about anything. Another bad thing is that if you have any kind of text that day, you could go onto your phone or the internet on your phone and get the answer, plus if you get caught you would be in really big trouble, you would fail the test, and your teachers probably not trust you forever, or atleast for a long time. I just listed some bad thing, but remember in the beginning of the letter I listed a whole bunch of good stuff? That is what you need to focus on the most, not the bad stuff. Also i bet that a lot of kids would agree with me when i tell you this; teenagers need their cell phones or they will die.  well not actually but the thing is to a lot people's lives, their cell phone is like their lives. and without it, they will fall apart  I just do not see a lot of bad things about cell phones. Well that is about all I have to say. Take care and please try to think this whole thing through, THE END.  from a student		0
Venus is called the ''Evening star"  is one of the brighest points of light in the night sky and it also our solar system venus is the second planet from our sun. While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth. It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. It's important that if we study about venus because it help us to know about happed in the world and it help us to know where the sun come from without the sun we won't be able to live long, and it's important to know about the earth. The venus's reputation as a challenging planet for human to study despite its proximity. In the text paragraph 8 it said "the venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself , but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally in intimidate endeavors. Venus is the closest planet to earth in term of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth,venus, and mars, our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to venus. Because venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud drapped world. Today, venus still has some features that are anlogous to thoses on earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters. I think that the studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers its presents is the venus is to help to stay safe.		0
Decision-making is a crucial aspect of life, and it becomes even more important during the high school years. From choosing which classes to take to deciding which college to attend, young adults must make tough decisions that will impact their future. In this essay, I will analyze the role of decision-making in life from high school to 18 years old and provide three examples.  The first decision that many high school students must make is which classes to take. High school curriculums offer a variety of courses, and students must choose which ones will best prepare them for their future. For example, a student who is interested in pursuing a career in science may choose to take advanced science courses, while a student who wants to become an artist may choose to take art classes. These decisions can have a significant impact on a student's future, as they may determine which colleges they are accepted into and what careers they are able to pursue.  The second decision that high school students must make is which college to attend. This decision can be incredibly challenging, as there are so many factors to consider. Students must consider the cost of tuition, the location of the school, the programs offered, and the reputation of the school. Additionally, students must also consider their own personal preferences and goals. For example, a student who values a small, liberal arts school may choose to attend a smaller college, while a student who wants to pursue a career in business may choose a larger, more prestigious school.  The third decision that young adults must make is what to do after graduation. This decision can be even more challenging than choosing which college to attend, as there are so many options available. Some young adults choose to enter the workforce immediately, while others choose to pursue further education. For example, a student who is interested in pursuing a career in engineering may choose to attend graduate school to earn a master's degree, while a student who wants to become a teacher may choose to enter the workforce and start teaching right away.  In conclusion, decision-making plays a crucial role in life, and it becomes even more important during the high school years. From choosing which classes to take to deciding which college to attend and what to do after graduation, young adults must make tough decisions that will impact their future. By carefully considering their options and making informed decisions, young adults can set themselves up for success and achieve their goals.		1
 Car-free cities are a growing trend in urban planning across the world. The idea is to make cities more pedestrian-friendly, improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and promote a more sustainable way of life. In this essay, we will explore the benefits and challenges of car-free cities.  One of the biggest benefits of car-free cities is that they promote a more active lifestyle. When people have to walk or use public transportation to get around, they are more likely to exercise and move around more often. This not only improves their health but also contributes to a overall healthier society.   Another benefit is the improvement of air quality. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution, which can improve the air quality of the city. This not only makes for a cleaner and healthier city, but it also makes for better touristic attractions as people come to cities with clean air to relax and enjoy the sights.   Car-free cities also eliminate the problem of traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities and can cause a lot of disruptions to daily life. By removing cars from the streets, traffic congestion is greatly reduced or eliminated, leading to smoother transportation for everyone.   However, car-free cities also present a number of challenges. At first, the loss of cars from the streets can lead to a decrease in revenue for some business owners, as tourists and residents may be deterred from visiting or relocating to a city that lacks a convenient way to get around. As with any urban planning measure, the implementation of a car-free city strategy requires careful planning and consideration for the needs of the community.   Additionally, some people may find it difficult to adapt to a car-free lifestyle. For those who are accustomed to driving, walking or using public transportation may be new or inconvenient. However, this can be overcome through education and preparation, as the benefits of a car-free city can far outweigh the short-term discomfort.   In conclusion, car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular as a way to improve urban life. While they present a number of challenges, the benefits of a walkable, sustainable, healthier, and cleaner society are too great to ignore. With careful planning and consideration, car-free cities can be a great way to build a better future for our urban communities.		1
Dear, Florida Senators  I believe that the Electoral College is a good way of voting for a President and Vice President because the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by  a single vote in Congress. The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors is the meeting where the electors vote for there President and Vice President. Plus the majority of the 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President of the United States. The United States entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation. One each of the memebers in the House of Representives plus two of your Senators. In our state, each citizens have there own group of voters that vote for a President and Vice President of there chose. Some even vote for candidates that are going for a person running for President or Vice President. Our state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. '  Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If I lived in Texas, for example, and wanted to vote for [Adam] Pis , I'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Pis. On the note, that those electors won the statewide election, they would goto congress and Pis would get 34 electoral votes. There are a lot of questions that people ask, who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state that some citizens are living in because some states can have picked electors and some dont even pick electors so, it must depends what state the citizen lives in.  Perhaps worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representive from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representives from California, who represents 35 million voters. Its hard to think about this but some are right, abolish the electoral college!  By PROPER_NAME  MONTH_DAY_YEAR                    		0
in the story the author explains several resaons on why studying venus is fasinating and interesting despite of the danger it presents. venus is a very earth-like planet and has many features like earth. researchers still to this day are working on innovations that will allow the machines that they send to venus last longer. this shows that many people still have an interest of visiting venus and learning more about it. there are still ways this can happen.  in the story "the challenging of exploring venus" the author belives that studying venus despiting the dangers presented is a worthy pursuit. in the text the lists his reasonings for his belief. he states that venus is a "earth-like planet in our solar system , he describes earth-like features that venus has still till this day. "the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, moutuntains, and craters". he also explains that venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.  in conclusion of this there are possible ways that venus could be studied overcoming the dangers that might come with it. 		0
The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. This is not a face created by aliens. The picture taking in 1998 revealed it was a natural landform, if NASA would have said it was aliens they would recieve more funding, however they said it was an illusion of a face, and in 2001 the picture taken clearly shows that it is a natural landform.  In 1998 NASA captured a pictue of the face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. The picture revealed that it was just a natural landform, just like NASA had said in 1976. Also, when the original picture was taken in 1976 it was revealed to be an illusion of a face by NASA. If NASA chose to call the landform work done by aliens, they would recieve more funding. However, NASA was very truthful in there fundings and they didn't have any reason besides the truth to say it was a natural landform. Finally, the clearest pictue of it taken in 2001 clearly shows a natural landform that couldn't be mistaken for anything else. A quote from the article is,"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. 'As a rule of thumb, you can dicern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,' he added, 'So, if there where objects in this picture like airplanes... or Egyptian-style pyramids... you could see what they were!'" This quote proves that the best picture ever taken so far of the Face clearly shows that it is a natural thing. The natural landform could not be mistaken as anything else in the pictures we have.  It is clear that the Face is a natural landform because the picture in 1998 revealed it, NASA comfired it was a natural thing which caused them to not get extra funding, and the picture taken in 2001 is the clearest one we have and it is very obvious that it is a natural landform. These reason show how the Face is a natural landform and not an alien made thing.		0
  Dear State Senator,   I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I believe it is still an important part of our democratic process.  One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a more accurate reflection of the popular vote. Unlike a direct popular vote, where a candidate could win an election with a plurality of votes rather than a majority, the Electoral College requires a candidate to receive a majority of votes to win. This means that the candidate who wins the most votes nationwide is more likely to win the presidency. As Bradford Plumer of Mother Jones points out, "the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong," and the Electoral College has prevented a candidate from winning the presidency despite receiving more individual votes (Plumer).  Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it ensures that presidential candidates must appeal to voters across the country, rather than just focusing on a handful of swing states. As Judge Richard A. Posner argues in "In Defense of the Electoral College," a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president, as voters in other regions will feel disenfranchised (Posner). By requiring candidates to campaign nationwide, the Electoral College encourages a wider range of views and policies.  Critics of the Electoral College argue that it is unfair to voters, as some states have more influence than others in the election. However, Posner argues that the winner-take-all system used in most states means that even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory, ensuring that every vote counts (Posner		1
Our solar system has always been something that humans can not fully comprhend; the concept of infinitety, space, and even other life forms. Through human curosity, we have made progression and answered many of our own questions about space, but we have yet to learn about the endevors of Venus, the ¨ Evening Star¨. Because of it's rough conditions, it has brought many challenges to scientist, but despite them all, many people believe that Venus is worthy the pursuit.  Venus has been know as the Earth's ¨twin¨ for many years. It has many harsh conditions such as the temperature, atmospheric pressure, and clouds that contain sulfuric acid. These are conditions that are far too extreme for any human to handle. According to the passage, ¨, such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our ocean and would liquefy many metals.¨( Paragraph 3). If such hard conditions, why would scientist even want to go to Venus? With powerful earthquakes, erupting volcanoes, and frequent lightning strikes, how would this benefit human science?  According to the author of ¨The Challenge of Exploring Venus¨, astronomers are facinated by Venus because at one point in time, it was probably the most similar planet to Earth. Scientist believe that Venus was once covered by large oceans that could have supported numerous life forms remensient to Earth. From the information we have gathered, Venus has similar surface features to Earth, such as valleys, craters, and mountians. The questions futher about future missions to Venus- how can astronomers construct a plan that will safely bring humans back home while receving worthy information?  NASA has been trying to solve this problem for a long time. They have found possible soultions such as making devices to have astronuts float above the planet or even upgrade old technology that could with stand these harmful conditions. The author of this passage gave other ways that they are trying to solve this problem. One way would be having some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that would be able to stand strong in Venus' environment. The author says that this would be a good subsitute for humans because not only has it lasted 3 weeks in chamber stimulations, but we can still gather useful information that scientist can use to make valid objections.  The world we live in is nothing compared to the universe that we live in. Humans have adapted to the earthly conditons that have surrounded us from the begging of time. As time has advanced, human's have advanced with it. Now that we have been able to go to space, we want to know about it all- even the harsh conditions and dangers of it all. The ¨Evening Star¨ is always something that astronomers will be curious about, but with the advancments that we can make from going to this planet, will all the dangers be worth the risk?		0
Cellphones in the Classroom: A Double-Edged Sword  As an 8th grader, I have witnessed the impact of cellphones in the classroom firsthand. While some argue that allowing students to have and use cellphones in class can enhance academic success, I believe it can have a negative impact on students' academic performance. Here are three key effects of having a cellphone in the classroom:  Firstly, not listening to the teacher can be a major distraction. When students are glued to their phones, they might miss important instructions or notes, leading to confusion and poor grades. Moreover, constant notifications and social media updates can divert their attention, making it challenging for them to focus on the lesson. As a result, students might struggle to keep up with the class and fall behind in their studies.  Secondly, not using cellphones properly for educational purposes can hinder academic success. While cellphones can be a valuable tool for learning, such as accessing educational apps and websites, students might misuse them by playing games, watching videos, or texting their friends. This can lead to a significant decrease in productivity and academic achievement. Furthermore, excessive phone use can lead to a lack of face-to-face interaction with peers and teachers, which is essential for building social skills and a supportive learning environment.  Thirdly, disturbing the class with cellphone use can disrupt the learning process. When students are constantly on their phones, they might disturb their peers or disrupt the lesson, leading to a negative impact on the overall academic atmosphere. Moreover, excessive phone use can lead to a lack of respect for the teacher and the learning environment, which can result in disciplinary actions.  In my opinion, people should not use cellphones in the classroom for non-educational purposes. While cellphones can be a valuable tool for learning, they can also be a distraction if not used properly. It is essential for students to understand the importance of staying focused and using their phones for educational purposes only. By doing so, they can maximize their academic potential and achieve their academic goals.  In conclusion, while cellphones can have some benefits in the classroom, their negative effects on academic success outweigh their advantages. It is crucial		1
 Life is short and it's important to make the most of it. Many people work hard and strive for success, but what truly matters is finding happiness in what they do. While some may believe that happiness comes from material possessions and financial stability, this is not always the case. In fact, many people who prioritize their work over their own happiness may find themselves feeling unfulfilled and unhappy in the long run.  Take, for example, a recent graduate who landed a job at Toyota. While they were initially excited about the opportunity, they soon found themselves feeling burnt out and unhappy with their job. It wasn't until they took a break and went on vacation that they realized the importance of taking time for themselves and pursuing their passions. During their vacation, they stumbled upon a flower farm and were inspired to start their own.  At first, they continued to work at Toyota part-time while also building their flower farm. But as time went on, they realized that they were happiest when they were working on their farm. They began to spend more and more time on it, and eventually decided to leave Toyota altogether to focus on their flower farm full-time.  This decision was not an easy one, as they had to give up a steady income and the security of a job. But they knew that their happiness was more important than their financial stability. And in the end, it was worth it. They were able to turn their passion into a successful business, and were able to live their life on their own terms.  In conclusion, it's important to prioritize your own happiness and find fulfillment in what you do. While it's important to work hard and strive for success, it's equally important to take time for yourself and pursue your passions. Whether it's starting a flower farm or pursuing a different career altogether, the key is to find what brings you joy and fulfillment.		1
Venus, otherwise known as the "Evening Star", is the closest thing to Earth as far as the base planets go. It is often called Earth's twin, even if it doesn't seem that way. The surface temperature is nearly 800 degrees Fahrenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of Earth. This being said, scientists are still fascinated by Venus, as it could have been just like Earth long ago. Despite the dangers it presents, studying Venus is a worthy persuit because it could lead to many scientific discoveries, and set foot on another planet and gather data, and see what happened to Venus and possibly find out how to prevent it from happening to Earth.  Even getting to Venus may seem like a stretch, but keep in mind that it is at times the closest planet to us, which is important considering the long time frames of space travel. Furthermore, even with the harsh surface temperatures, there's a way around it. A vehicle hovering Venus would still be able to get data about the planet without burdening itself with the the tough conditions. Even if this can only provide limited insight, scientists are working everyday to on technology that lasts long enough to be able to get meaningful samples such as soil, rock and gas. For example, NASA has developed simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in Venus-like conditions, and they lasted about 3 weeks in the harsh temperature and pressure. Another project is looking to the past to mechanical computers, computers that don't use electronics, but use gears and levers to make calculations. They could be made to withstand the conditions of Venus, while also taking data and making calculations for study.  Although there are many challenges that need to be overcame and scientific breakthroughs that need to be discovered before we even think about sending anything to Venus, studying Venus is a worthy persuit because of the discoveries it could hold. From regular rock and gas to preventing a catastrophe, scientists should continue to study our sister planet, and see what's really beneath the surface. 		0
 Car-free cities have been gaining popularity in recent years, and the trend is only expected to continue in the near future. The idea of a car-free city may seem like a utopian concept, but it is a practical solution to a variety of problems that our society faces. From reducing air pollution to promoting public health, car-free cities have the potential to transform the way we live and work.  One major benefit of car-free cities is the reduction of air pollution. Cars are one of the most significant sources of air pollution, with tailpipes releasing harmful chemicals into the atmosphere. In cities that have implemented car-free measures, there has been a significant decrease in air pollutants, leading to improved air quality for residents.  Another advantage of car-free cities is the promotion of public health. Air pollution is a major public health hazard, and inhaling air pollutants can lead to a variety of health problems, including respiratory issues and cardiovascular disease. By reducing air pollution in cities, we can help to protect the health of residents, particularly those who are most vulnerable, such as children and the elderly.  Car-free cities can also help to reduce traffic congestion, which is a major problem in many cities around the world. Traffic congestion not only leads to longer travel times and increased stress for drivers, but it also contributes to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By implementing car-free measures, cities can help to reduce traffic congestion and make it easier for people to get around.  Of course, the idea of a car-free city may seem unrealistic to some, but there are already many cities that have taken steps towards this kind of transportation model. In fact, some cities, such as Copenhagen, Denmark, have already implemented car-free measures and have seen significant benefits as a result.  In addition, there are many creative solutions being proposed for car-free cities, such as bike-sharing programs, walking and cycling infrastructure, and public transportation systems. These solutions can help to make car-free transportation more accessible and convenient for residents, making it easier for them to embrace this way of life.  In conclusion, car-free cities have the potential to bring a variety of benefits to our society. From reducing air pollution to promoting public health, they can help to solve some of the most pressing problems that we face today. While the idea of a car-free city may seem daunting, the solutions that are being proposed are creative and accessible, making it easier for cities to embrace this kind of transportation model. As we continue to move towards a more sustainable future, car-free cities are one of the most promising solutions for creating a better, healthier, and more livable world.		1
Art classes, such as drama, acting, or music, have been a staple in many schools for years. However, I believe that these classes should not be a requirement for students. While art classes may have some benefits, they are not as diverse, fun, or interactive as other electives. Additionally, making art classes a requirement would not be beneficial to students in the future.  Firstly, electives offer a wider range of options for students to choose from. Electives are designed to allow students to explore their interests and passions, and they come in many different forms. This means that students can choose from a variety of subjects, including art, sports, music, and more. By allowing students to choose their electives, they are more likely to be engaged and interested in the subject matter, which can lead to better academic performance.  Secondly, electives are often more fun and interactive than traditional art classes. In traditional art classes, students may spend most of their time sitting in a classroom, listening to a teacher lecture. In contrast, electives often involve hands-on activities, group projects, and collaborative learning. This can make the learning experience more enjoyable and engaging for students.  Finally, making art classes a requirement would not be beneficial to students in the future. The job market is constantly changing, and students need to be prepared for the jobs of the future. This means that students should have the freedom to choose which electives they take, so that they can develop skills that are relevant to their future careers. For example, if a student is interested in pursuing a career in technology, they may choose to take an elective in coding or robotics, rather than an art class.  In conclusion, while art classes may have some benefits, they are not as diverse, fun, or interactive as other electives. Additionally, making art classes a requirement would not be beneficial to students in the future. Students should have the freedom to choose which electives they take, so that they can develop skills that are relevant to their future careers. By allowing students to choose their electives, we can help ensure that they are engaged, interested, and prepared for the future.		1
In 1976 NASA scientists took a picture of a landform on Mars. Many people thought it looked like a human face. Some other people knew that it was just a landform that was common on Mars. I am here to tell you that is was just a natural landform. NASA has evidence that will backup this statement. In the following paragraphs I will tell you about the evidence, the camera technology, and how the media affected the responds of people.  Many people will argue that the mesa on Mars is a face. Although it may look like a face, it isn't. In paragraph 1 it says, "Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia..." This quote tells us that the scientists were used to seeing these large landforms around the region. NASA wouldn't release these images if they thought aliens were involved. The object you see in the picture is simply a landform with shadows in just the right spot.  Back in 1976, the camera technology wasn't great. Many of the cameras had large pixles that made the pictures blury. In paragraph 10 it says, "Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo." This quote proves that the camera technology has improved greatly. Some conspiracy theorists aruge that even though the picture was not at high resolution, you can still see a face. This may be true,but you can also clearly see the shadows that made it look like a face.  The media had a significant impact on the Mars event. In paragraph 5 it says, "It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows...and grocery store checkout lanes for 25 years." This shows that the media has made people believe that there is a face on Mars.  After going back and taking a picture of the face years after the original photo was taken, you can no longer see the face. In paragraph 10 it says, "Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution." This goes onto prove that NASA was right the whole time about the "Face" on Mars. This statement also shows that NASA was working on this mystery too.  After looking at all the evidence and photos you can clearly see that the "Face" on Mars is just a landform. If you think there is life on Mars, think again. The face has entertained many people for years, so it is nice to finally put this mystery behind us.		0
 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a new technology that uses the movements of a person's face to identify emotions. This technology has been developed with the intention of reading facial expressions accurately and identifying emotional states. However, while this technology has shown promise in its development, it raises questions about its usefulness in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author explores the potential of using FACS to enhance the learning experience of students. This essay will argue that while FACS has the potential to be useful in reading the emotional expressions of students, it has limitations that must be considered before its implementation in classrooms.  One of the key benefits of FACS is its accuracy in identifying emotional states. The technology relies on the analysis of micro-expressions, which are subtle and brief movements of the facial muscles. According to the article, FACS can identify these movements with up to 98% accuracy. This accuracy means that teachers can get a sense of what their students are feeling without intruding on their privacy.  In addition, FACS can provide real-time feedback to students and teachers. By identifying emotional states, teachers can adjust their teaching methods to better suit their students' needs. For example, if a student is feeling anxious, a teacher can provide them with additional support to help them relax. Similarly, if a student is feeling bored, a teacher can adjust their lesson plan to make it more engaging.  However, there are limitations to the use of FACS in classrooms. One of the most significant limitations is privacy concerns. The article notes that FACS requires access to a student's face, which raises ethical concerns about surveillance and tracking. Without proper safeguards in place, the use of FACS in classrooms could lead to a violation of students' privacy rights.  Another limitation is the accuracy of emotional identification. While FACS claims to be highly accurate, it is not foolproof. The article notes that FACS can struggle to identify emotions that are not easily visible on a person's face, such as empathy or sadness. Additionally, cultural differences can affect how facial expressions are interpreted, which could lead to misinterpretations.  In conclusion, FACS has the potential to be a valuable tool in identifying the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. However, it is important to consider the limitations of the technology, such as privacy concerns and the accuracy of emotional identification. Before implementing FACS in classrooms, schools must develop proper safeguards to protect students' privacy rights and ensure that the technology is being used accurately to identify emotional states.		1
Dear principal  I think many students want to help planet Earth in many ways. I help the planet by picking up trash or by helping animals, sometimes my friends throw trash on the floor and i tell to pick it up and throw it away. Many kids want to help the planet Earth but sometime they don't show it, they look like they don't want to help but they do. I think helping planet Earth is very helpful but sometimes it cant take time from you like you have to do something else but you can because you have to help the planet. Kids don't know that you can help planet Earth at least 3 times a week you don't have to do it every day. People like adults help the planet every day hey just don't know it. I tell my parents to tell their friends to help the planet Earth and i tell my friends to tell their friends to help the Earth because its very important to help our planet because we want to protect it and keep it safe we want to go GREEN. The word green its very important because it means that we want to recycle and help the Earth, people use that word a lot like they would say "Go green" This word helps a lot because it means helping and people like to help. If i were a principal i would do this for my students and for planet Earth and i would try to help to.		0
 Dear Senator,  I am writing to you as a concerned citizen of the United States, advocating for the retention of the Electoral College as the current method of electing the President of the United States. While I understand the concerns of those who argue for a popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College system provides several important benefits that should not be ignored.  Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome in presidential elections. While it is possible for a candidate to receive the most popular votes nationwide but lose the election, this has only happened once since 1888 (in 2000). The winner-take-all nature of the Electoral College means that a candidate must win a majority of the electoral votes to be elected President, providing a clear and decisive outcome.  Secondly, the Electoral College requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal. This means that candidates must appeal to voters across the country, rather than just focusing on their own region or state. This ensures that the President is elected by the entire nation, rather than just a particular group or region.  Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states. This means that candidates must pay attention to all states, not just the ones they are likely to win. This ensures that all voters have a voice in the election, and that candidates are accountable to the entire nation, not just their own supporters.  Fourthly, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political system. Large states, which often have a disproportionate amount of political power, are given more weight in the election through the Electoral College. This ensures that the voices of all Americans are heard, and that no one group or region has too much power.  Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This has only happened once since 1888, and the Electoral College provides a clear and decisive outcome, avoiding the need for a run-off election.  In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the Electoral College system, I believe that it provides several important benefits that should not be ignored. The certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, swing state campaigning, balance in the political system, and avoidance of run-off elections all make the Electoral College an important part of the American democratic process.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1

Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the president of the United States by popular vote.   The Electoral College is a system in which each state is allocated a number of electors equal to its total number of seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district.  The Electoral College was created in 1787 by the Founding Fathers as a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by Congress and those who wanted the president to be elected by a popular vote of the people. The Founding Fathers believed that the Electoral College would protect the interests of smaller states by ensuring that they would have a voice in the presidential election.  However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary to protect the interests of smaller states. The current system gives more power to voters in less populous states than to voters in more populous states. This is because each state has two senators and at least one representative in the House of Representatives, regardless of its population. As a result, a voter in Wyoming has more than three times the voting power of a voter in California.  The Electoral College also leads to the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016 when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes but lost the election to Donald Trump.  The Electoral College is an outdated system that no longer serves the needs of the American people. It is time to abolish the Electoral College and elect the president by popular vote.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
February 28, 2011  Dear Principal,  Many have noticed your idea to bring the grade, to participate in sports and other activities, to B average instead of keeping it at a C. I, personally, am against it. One thing I would like to point out is a B grade stands for above average and C stand for average. If you bring the participation grade to a B you will probably lose a lot of the students because of their grade. Losing students will most likely reduce the amount of players on the football team which will decrease school pride. This is probably just an old wives tale, but I have heard that if your school has a lot of school pride, crime rate, in school, goes down. People would actually be proud to be at this school. Those that are C students may be discouraged at that fact that you have set the bar above them and believe that they will never reach that level. This may bring down their grades and set them off course of a college degree. Now I plead with you, think through this idea before you accept it. Thank you.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
Texting and Driving  Majority of the world's population has a cell phone. Most people who have a cell phone use their phone daily. However how many people use their phones while driving? According the New York Post a servey showed that 90% people still use a smart phone while driving despite the laws against it. People should not be distracted by phones while driving.  Being distracted while driving is very dangerous. According to edgasnyder. com, people are six times more likely to cause an accident by being distracted than being drunk. Think about this, you are in the car driving, going sixty. There's no one around for miles and you get a text asking when you are going to be home. However instead of pilling over and answering it, you take fifteen to thirty seconds answering it. Thinking you can reply quick without any worry. Little did you know in that short time frame you spent answering a text you have traveled past the length of a football field. Now let's say as soon as you had pressed send and you looked up from your phone there was a deer, standing there, in the path of your car. However, since you where texting you had no Idea it was there. You have little time to react. Jerking the wheel trying to get out of its path, however you were not fast enough. You still hit the deer. Shattering your windshield, and your car flipping from jerking the wheel and killing you. All because you took that time to answer a text.

People don't stop and consider the dangers of texting and driving until they are out of the car. Whenever they are in the car and their phone lights up with a new text message, they don't stop to think that this could end my life. Instead they answer it. Ignoring the road. Anything could happen on the road and they wouldn't know about it until the last second and have very time to react. Texting and driving is extremely dangerous and everything that is texted isn't important enough to end your life over. Every text can wait until you get where you need to be.                               		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing as a constituent and student to share my view on an essential part of our democratic process, the Electoral College. Given the diverse opinions that exist on this topic, I urge your consideration of both perspectives.   The Electoral College, mandated by our founding fathers, facilitates a process of electing the President involving selection of electors, their voting for the President and Vice President, and the counting of these votes by Congress (Office of the Federal Register). The intention was to form a bridge between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and by popular vote of qualified citizens (Office of the Federal Register).  However, the Electoral College is susceptible to complications. It has sometimes led to scenarios wherein the President-elect does not hold the majority of the popular vote (Plumer). An example of this is the 2000 election, where Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency (Plumer). A significant issue associated with the College is when electors defy the people's will (Plumer).   Despite these instances, the rationale for retaining the Electoral College is strong. Judge Richard Posner outlines five practical reasons to maintain our current system: Certainty of Outcome, Everyone’s President, Swing States, Big States, and to Avoid Run-Off Elections (Posner). The necessity of the Electoral College's regional appeal, its attention to larger states, and the navigability around a majority-vote quandary provide a distinct and integral structure to our nation's electoral process.   Without a doubt, the Electoral College is undemocratic by contemporary standards (Posner). Voters cast their ballots for electors rather than the Presidential candidate directly (Posner). Yet, the emphasis the College places on securing political balance and ensuring clear electoral outcomes validates its implications to our democratic system (Posner). However, the plight of potential voters in politically one-sided states, who feel their vote won’t sway their state’s majority, might lead to a decrease in voter turnout (Posner).  Therefore, although shifting to direct popular vote could provide a straightforward, every-vote-counts approach, the complexity of our nation requires the buffer that the Electoral College offers between pure popular sentiment and the selection of the President. Consider the implementation of a proportional system nationwide, similar to the one used by Maine and Nebraska, to address the issue of one-sided states and enhance the inclusivity provided by the Electoral College.  Thank you for considering my perspective on this critical matter. I believe we share the common goal of wanting a fair, effective process to elect the President of our beloved democracy.   Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Dear Principal,  I think that we should not change the policy so that you can only play sports if you have a B average. I think that many students and parents will complain about this for similar reasons that I have. I also think that if this policy goes into effect then their will be very few people on the various sports teams and the teams would not be as good.  I have many reasons for why I don't think that this policy should go into effect. My main reason is that a lot of the people who are very athletic and good at almost all sports have trouble concentrating in a classroom because they just want to be out doing something, anything. I think that if you took away the ability for them to play sports with their friends from school, the majority of the kids would start to do even worse in the classroom because they just don't care anymore. Yes, some would work harder to get better grades, but who knows if they even could. They probable have never really tried before, so it would be a great struggle for them.  Another of my big reasons is that as the Principal of our school, you should care about how the different sports teams are doing in their various seasons. If the kids who were better at sports could not play because their grades weren't so hot, then the teams would probably be not very good or their would be no team at all because there were not enough people to play on the team. Then the kids who did want to play would not get the chance to and then them and their parents would be mad at the school and you.  My last reason is, who would coach? All of the good coaches are generally a parent of one of the kids on the team, one of the good kids on the team. So if all the kids who were good at that sport could not play, then their parent would not want to coach if their kid wasn't on the team.  So as you can see it is a very bad idea to change the policy to a B average instead of a C average. There are many rock solid reasons not to change the policy above. I advise you to read over them thoroughly and make your decision. Please make the right choice, and remember if the knew policy does go into effect then it won't just be me that you are hearing from.  Sincerely,  Your anonymous sports fanatic		0
As an eighth-grade student, I believe that changing the policy to require a minimum grade of B to join school sports teams is a positive change. While there are some potential drawbacks to this policy, the benefits of improved grades, increased physical activity, and increased college acceptance outweigh the negatives.  One of the main benefits of this policy is that it will encourage students to work harder to maintain their grades. By requiring a minimum grade of B to join sports teams, students will be more motivated to study and improve their academic performance. This will not only benefit them in the short term by allowing them to participate in sports, but it will also benefit them in the long term by increasing their chances of getting into a good college.  Another benefit of this policy is that it will increase physical activity among students. Participating in sports is a great way to stay active and healthy, and by requiring a minimum grade of B to join teams, more students will be encouraged to participate. This will not only benefit their physical health, but it will also benefit their mental health by reducing stress and improving mood.  Finally, this policy will increase the chances of college acceptance for students who maintain a minimum grade of B. Many colleges look at academic performance when making admissions decisions, and by requiring a minimum grade of B to join sports teams, students will be more likely to meet the academic requirements for college admission. This will not only benefit the students who maintain the minimum grade, but it will also benefit the school as a whole by increasing the number of students who go on to college.  While there are some potential drawbacks to this policy, such as the possibility of excluding students who are struggling academically but still want to participate in sports, the benefits of improved grades, increased physical activity, and increased college acceptance outweigh the negatives. By requiring a minimum grade of B to join school sports teams, students will be more motivated to work harder academically, stay active physically, and increase their chances of college acceptance.		1
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on the positive and negative aspects of technology as an 8th grade student:  Technology, oh technology. It's like, everywhere. In our pockets, on our wrists, in our homes, and even in our schools. It's like, we can't escape it. And honestly, I think that's both good and bad.  The good things about technology are like, obvious. We can communicate with people all over the world with just a few taps on our phones. We can learn new things and get answers to our questions with just a quick Google search. And we can play games and watch videos and stuff, which is like, super fun. I mean, who doesn't love Fortnite? 😂  But then there are the bad things. Like, technology can be really distracting. Like, have you seen how much time kids spend on their phones during school? It's like, crazy. And sometimes it's hard to focus on what we're supposed to be doing because we're so busy scrolling through Instagram or something. And don't even get me started on cyberbullying. That's like, super mean and it can really hurt people's feelings.  Another thing is, technology can be really addictive. Like, I know people who can't put their phones down for more than five minutes without getting withdrawals. And it's not just phones, it's like, all the other devices too. Laptops, tablets, watches, you name it. It's like, we're all hooked on technology or something.  But even though there are some downsides to technology, I think it's still pretty cool. Like, we can use it to learn new things and explore the world in ways we never could before. And we can connect with people from all over the world and learn about their cultures and stuff. It's like, pretty amazing when you think about it.  So, in conclusion, technology is like, complicated. It's got its good points and its bad points. But I think we can all agree that it's here to stay, so we might as well learn how to use		1
When asking for advice, it is important to talk to multiple people so you can get different opinions. Getting different opinions helps the person make a wise choice, instead of making a rash decision and using only one person's opinion. Asking for advice is basically doing research, because for both you use multiple opinions, whether from people, websites, or books, to conduct smart research or to make a good decision. For example, if I was doing an essay for school, I would use multiple websites and many different books on my topic so that my essay would be factual and outstanding. If all of my information came from one source, my essay may not be as factual because I would not have any other source to compare it to. Doing research is similar to asking for advice because if I wanted to know what people thought about a certain restaurant, I would get multiple opinions by asking friends and reading reviews online.  Having multiple opinions makes the person more knowledgeable about what they are seeking advice for. For example if you were thinking about buying a hand soap, you would probably ask for advice before you bought the hand soap. If you asked a friend that had received a defected bottle, they may tell you that the product is terrible because of their experience with the product. But if you ask another friend who had a great experience with the hand soap, they will probably tell you how terrific the soap is and how beautiful it smelled. The person that had a bad experience will be biased to say that the product is bad, but the review is the opposite for the person that had a great experience with the hand soap.  I have personally made the mistake of not seeking advice from multiple people when I decided to buy a pair of shoes. I had asked a friend what his thoughts were on a pair of shoes and he said that they were great. I then asked him if I should wait to see if they go on sale, but he said the shoes were so amazing that I should buy a pair right away. So I bought the shoes at the store, and when we returned a week later, the shoes were discounted for 20%. If I had asked for multiple opinions on whether I should or shouldn't buy the pair of shoes I may have saved $15 that day. That event always reminds me to seek advice from many people to receive multiple viewpoints and make a wise decision.		0
Dear Principal,  I understand that you are trying to decide whether or not to require all students to perform community service. I would have to side with,  I do think that you should require all students to do community service, because community service is very important, it helps others, and you get a great feeling after you have done service.  First of all, community service is very important. It is a chance for people who live in a community to show that they care for their environment and each other as well. There are lots of ways to provide community service. Whether it being, you babysit for a neighbor, or plant new flowers, or mow a neighbors lawn.  It shows that you care and that you are willing to help so that you can live in a happy community.  Next, community service helps others.  For example if you mow and elderly persons yard, maybe that person can no longer do the job themselves because of an injury or problem that they might have. So it is very nice to help that person whether they know it was you or not. When you do community service, you should not expect anything in return. That is why it is called service. While you do service you should have a good attitude and put your best foot forward.  Lastly, after you have done community service you will feel great. You will know that you have done good and have helped some one or done something for the community.  If you decide to require all of the students to do community service it could improve their attitudes, because they are happy about what they have done. Service can be small things or big things, but it still counts. If you are happy, have made some one else happy, or have done something to clean up the environment, then you have done service.  In conclusion,  I do think that you should require all students to do community service, because community service is very important, it helps others, and you get a great feeling after you have done service. It could help with the attitude of students. And will make students happy and after they do it they will know what it feels like and will probably want to do it again.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME         		0
When it comes to life advice, it is always wise to get opinions from multiple people. Drawing from a variety of sources and perspectives provides a robust set of ideas to consider and helps to ensure that no stone is left unturned. As an example, if you’re trying to make the important decision of whether to go back to school and pursue a new degree, consulting with your family, mentors, or friends can be helpful in understanding different angles and potential outcomes.   Having multiple people weigh in on a decision can provide the support and confidence necessary to move forward; hearing different perspectives also reminds us to be flexible and to remain open to new possibilities, while keeping sight of our own personal values and goals. This is especially true in instances when a single opinion or valued opinion may not be sufficient. For example, if you are planning to make a career change you may need to talk to people who have successfully gone through the transition in order to recognize potential obstacles and create a realistic plan.   Getting advice from multiple people allows us to benefit from everyone’s individual experiences, paving the way to a knighted path of informed decisions. All in all, leveraging feedback from multiple sources can be a rewarding and incredibly enriching venture on our life journeys.		1

Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,  This is STUDENT_NAME saying that i think it is ridiculous to change the sports policy to a C average. I have gotten support by this idea from many students who play sports for the school. I have done some studying on most of the student grades and most students at our school are making low C' s - high B' s. I don't think this new policy is fair because we will lose amazing players that make C+ average. It is possible that We will lose a lot of students on our campus as well. I think that we should at least discuss this issue with the students who participate with school sports. I have also taken study on other school websites and most of their sport requirements are high C' s. Most of us here at SCHOOL_NAME really do think that you are taking this to far. Even some of the teachers are agreeing on my input, they have all signed my partition on lowering the policy. Please TEACHER_NAME, except our agreement on what we students of SCHOOL_NAME say. It would really make myself, my peers and the teachers here very happy.  Thank you,  Your students.		0
Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students learn by different ways now especially with advances to technology. Many find learning from home appropriate and the best option for their leaning experience. The opposition wrongly believes students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because of learning disabilities and also if a student has possible questions that need to be answered. Although some believe students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, it should be known students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home.  Students who attend classes from home are able to stay on task due to internal skills. One internal skill a student achieves from working at home is being more productive. To be productive means simply staying on task to get work done faster. An example of being productive is a student while attending school at home is given multiple assignments. However, the student exemplifies a sense of purpose and works to their fullest potential to get the work done in an orderly fashion. Next, students who attend classes from home are able to obtain time management. Time management means being able to work while using the time a person is given wisely. For example, a student might take classes at home but has to also make time for house cleaning, and their job. However, the individual creates a schedule to make sure they have time to do all of these tasks in a timely fashion. This shows that a student can gain time management skills because they are able to get basic house work done and at the same time prioritize school work. Finally, students who attend classes from home are able to obtain responsibility. Being responsible means doing the assigned work without being told to do it. For instance, a student who is assigned work does the work without being reminded by teacher or professor. This shows responsibility because some students realize that online school is an advantage that should not be taken for granted.  Students who attend classes from home are able to stay on task due to external benefits. One external benefit a student has from working home is less distractions. Distractions are people, animals , or things that limits and individuals way of staying focus. For example, students who take classes at home some might live by themselves. However, in some cases a quiet environment allows a student to focus and understand what they are learning. This allows them to get work done faster because at school there are multiple distractions around a person so its easy to get off task. Next, students who take classes at home benefit because it can potentially increase their grades. This means grades in a particular class would rise. For instance, a student might have a problem taking classes in school because they can not get decent grades. Therefore, they take classes at home which motivates them and because of that they have a different attitude and they start applying themselves. Which is the the turning point for them increasing their grades. Finally, students benefit from taking classes at home because they are able to work ahead of everyone. Working ahead means doing required work ahead of time before it is due. For example, a student doing grad point might take extra classes at home to get more credits. In doing this students are able to take classes ahead of others and once they get their required amount of credits they can possibly graduate early.  Even though some believe students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, it should be known students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Opponents incorrectly think, students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because of just pure laziness and a lack of motivation a person has. However, students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home due to internal skills a student will achieve like productivity, time management, and responsibility. Additionally, students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home due to external benefits like a chance at higher grades, less distractions, and being able to work ahead. Students should understand taking classes from home can argued as one of the greatest advances in today's society. Being able to work at home allows students to build skills needed for future careers and learn proper work ethic needed for certain jobs. Individuals should not take opportunities like this for granted and should work to their fullest potential if given this great opportunity.		0
Have you ever wanted to ride the waves? Well, I did. I was a seagoing cowboy. My name is Luke. I think you will like seagoing Cowboys because you can visit cool places, have fun with other crew mates, and see cool things. Here is why you can see cool places.  When you are a seagoing cowboy, that means that you get to move cattle around on a boat and visit neat places. When I was a seagoing cowboy, I went to places like China and Greece. It was pretty cool, and I think you would like it if you try it. Now, I will tell you how to have fun with other crew mates.  After you drop the cattle off, you have some free space. To use that free space, me and my crew mates did a lot of fun activities. We boxed, we played baseball and volleyball, as well as table-tennis tournaments. It was really fun. Now is why you will see cool things.  When you are visiting places like China and Greece, you get to see cool things in those places. In Greece I saw the Acropolis. I also visited Venice, Italy, and went on a gondola ride. It was wonderful. I will now start to end.  While being a seagoing cowboy, you can see neat places. As well as neat places, cool structures. And, you can always have fun while doing this. I think that you should be a seagoing cowboy, it'll be the most fun you've ever had.		0
Cars have been a part of our lives for over a century now. They have made our lives easier and more convenient, but they have also come with a number of negative consequences. One of the biggest problems with cars is that they contribute to pollution. Cars emit greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, and they also release pollutants into the air that can cause respiratory problems.  Another problem with cars is that they can be dangerous. Car accidents are a leading cause of death in the United States, and they can also cause serious injuries. In addition, cars take up a lot of space. This can make it difficult to find parking, and it can also make it difficult to walk or bike around.  There are a number of things we can do to reduce our reliance on cars. We can walk or bike whenever possible, and we can take public transportation or carpool when we need to travel further distances. We can also support policies that make it easier to walk, bike, and take public transportation.  Limiting car usage has a number of benefits. It can help to reduce pollution, improve public health, and make our cities more livable. It can also save us money on transportation costs.  If we want to create a more sustainable and healthy future, we need to start thinking about ways to limit our reliance on cars. Walking, biking, and public transportation are all healthier and more sustainable forms of transportation. Let's make them the new normal.  In addition to the environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on our communities. When people are able to walk, bike, or take public transportation, they are more likely to interact with their neighbors and build a sense of community. This can lead to a more vibrant and livable community for everyone.  Of course, there are some challenges to limiting car usage. One challenge is that it can be difficult to change our habits. We are used to driving everywhere, and it can be hard to break that habit. Another challenge is that our infrastructure is designed for cars, not for people. This means that it can be difficult to walk, bike, or take public transportation in some places.  Despite these challenges, I believe that limiting car usage is the right thing to do. It is good for our environment, our health, and our communities. We need to start thinking about ways to make it easier for people to walk, bike, and take public transportation. If we can do that, we can create a more sustainable, healthy, and livable future.		1
When faced with an important decision, it is wise to get different perspectives before making a choice. Talking to more than one person allows you to gather various insights and viewpoints that you may have otherwise overlooked on your own. Multiple opinions can help in a few key ways.  First, different people often have different experiences and backgrounds that shape their advice. What worked well for one person in a similar situation may not be the best approach for you. By hearing from more than one source, you increase the chances of getting advice tailored specifically to your own circumstances. No one person can anticipate all the factors that might impact your unique choice.   Second, multiple opinions help balance out biases. When we only seek counsel from one individual, their advice may be unconsciously skewed by their own preferences or beliefs. However, listening to a few trusted people reduces the influence of any single bias. Common themes across different perspectives start to emerge as preferable solutions. Contradictions also serve as useful flags to reconsider certain options.   Finally, considering advice from more than one person spurs more thoughtful reflection on your decision. You have to think critically about how each viewpoint relates to your situation and priorities. Investigating various recommendations prevents you from making a snap choice or being too easily swayed. The decision becomes your own, informed choice rather than passive acceptance of a single recommendation.   In conclusion, weighing options thoughtfully requires input from more sources than one. Seeing an issue from multiple sides offers a well-rounded understanding to guide your best choice. While any advice may still involve some risk, diversifying your counsel minimizes that risk through a broader range of lived experiences and balanced viewpoints.		1
A good attitude is a crucial aspect of our lives that can have a significant impact on our personal and professional growth. It is the foundation upon which we build our relationships, our achievements, and our success. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of having a good attitude and provide a personal example of how it can help us achieve our goals more efficiently.  Firstly, having a good attitude can improve our lives in many ways. A positive attitude helps us to see the world in a more optimistic light, which can lead to better mental and emotional health. It can help us to overcome challenges, reduce stress, and increase our overall happiness. Additionally, a good attitude can improve our relationships by making us more approachable, empathetic, and understanding. It can also help us to build stronger connections with others and create a more positive and supportive environment.  Secondly, having a good attitude can help us to learn more effectively. When we have a positive attitude towards learning, we are more motivated to engage in the process and are more likely to retain the information we learn. This can lead to better academic performance, increased creativity, and a greater sense of accomplishment. Furthermore, a good attitude towards learning can help us to develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and a growth mindset, which are essential for success in any field.  Lastly, having a good attitude can give us better results than having a bad attitude. When we approach tasks with a positive attitude, we are more likely to be persistent, focused, and productive. This can lead to better outcomes and a greater sense of accomplishment. Additionally, a good attitude can help us to overcome obstacles and setbacks more effectively, which can lead to greater resilience and a more positive outlook on life.  Personally, I have experienced the benefits of having a good attitude firsthand. When I was in high school, I struggled with my studies and often felt overwhelmed by the workload. However, I realized that my attitude towards learning was holding me back and decided to make a change. I started to approach my studies with a more positive attitude, focusing on the progress I was making and the knowledge I was gaining, rather than just the grades I was getting. As a result, I became more motivated, engaged, and productive, and my grades began to improve significantly.  In conclusion, having a good attitude is essential for personal and professional growth,		1
Extracurricular activities, such as playing sports, instruments, and joining after school clubs are highly encouraged by adults and teachers for growing adolecents. Recently, the principal of the Generic_School stated all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I believe forcing students to join a club activity will be unnecessary, unproductive, and inefficient considering the cost and the effort. There is not enough data and evidence to ensure that all students will like their activities, it will create a fair cooperation and competition environment among diverse groups of students, and finally to prove that every student will enjoy extracurricular activities.  My first argument is that it will force students to participate in an activity that they might not enjoy which is unhealthy. My current school, Generic_School, does not have unlimited budget, faculty members, and space for different club activities. With very limited resources, the school will much prefer to establish more popular clubs than smaller clubs. Options that the school offer may not serve everyone's interest, but students will still need to choose an unappealing activity because it is mandotary. For example, when I was at a camp last summer, I was asked to choose five different activities. However, they did not offer all the courses I wanted and I ended up joining the swimming class which is my least favorite sport. From my own personal experience, I concern how some students might lose their interests or end up disliking their chosen clubs activities.  Secondly, the plan seems unfair for certain group of students and will develop an unhealthy competition environment. It will simply create a disparity betweeen students who can afford private lessons or tutorings to get better at the activity and those who cannot. For example, a clarinet player who receives private lessons and plays in a local band will be able to perform much harder music and eventually be placed in a more advanced band than his peers who cannot afford the cost. This allows an environment where certain group of students will continue to get better and others cannot. Not only will it pressure the students with unnecessary stress, but it will also burden their parents financially.  Lastly and most importantly, it does not necessary have to be an extracurricular activity as far as the students are passionate about the activity. For example, some people might be passionate about learning foreign languages and cultures or solving creative math problems which are not considered extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities are meant to help students find their hobbies and interests. However, for students who already have hobbies that are not necessary defined as an extracurricular activity, such as reading books or writing creative stories, it is not right to force them to do something that they are not interested in when they have already found their interests. Everyone is born with different talent and interest. For instance, I enjoy public speaking and joined the Generic_School Debate team, whereas others might fear giving speechs in front of their classmates during civics class. Extracurricular activities may not be the best option for all students.  Although extracurricular activities are known to promote adolecents' overall well-being in general, there seems to be more disadvantages than benefits to this plan. Because the school board has limited resources to offer, it will be practically difficult to make extracurricular activities mandotary and ensure all students could benefit from this plan. We also cannot make sure that everyone will like the activities and create health and only necessary competition among the students. I value some benefits of this proposal but believe that it is more disadvantageous towards students and that is the reason why I disagree with this plan.  		0
In my opinion i think that having driverless cars is a good idea. Many people are very distracted during car rides and do not know how to pay attention to the road. Having drivereless cars will be a good thing for the community becuase it can help nervous drivers get through traffic safetly, help stop texting and driving, and it notifies people of their surrounding so that they will not run into things while driving.  Driveless cars allow people to be notified of their surrounding so that they will not run into things. For example, " GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object." This feauture allows the driver to know when it should stop reversing by adding vibrations to your seat so that they will not hit anything. When the driver feels the vibration it will know that there is an object neerby and it is necessary for them to stop. This will cause less accidents and make it safer for people to drive. The " blind spot" while driving will not longer be a problem while driving because you will now have a sensor that tells you when you are to close to an object making it safer to drive.  A lot of people text and drive or talk on the phone while driving even if they know it is not the safe thing to do. The driveless car has a feature called" In-car entertainment and information system" that allows people to do this while not putting there life in danger. The text states, " Some manufaturers hope to bring in car intertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over- something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone" People will have the opportunity to text while the car is driving but as soon as the car is in need of the driver it will take away the feauture so that the driver will not be texting while driving so that will not be putting their life or other peoples life in danger.  The driveless car has a "Trafic Jam Assistant". Some people get really nervous while driving in traffic causing them to get overwhemled and maybe even cause an accident. The " Traffic Jam Assistant" can help stop that by helping get through traffic safely. For example, " Traffic Jam Assistance .. The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel." This feauture will allow drivers some assistance getting through traffic jams. Going at 25 mhp, and sensors that allow it to detect objects near by traffic jams will no longer be a scary experience for drivers.  I think that driveless cars are good for the future. It will help nervous drivers get through traffic jams easily, notify people of their surroundings to make sure they do not crash into things, and help stop texting and driving accidents. People live busy and hectic lives and sometimes driving under stress is not safe. The driveless car will help make less accidents for people and a safer driving experience for everyone.   		0
When it comes to deciding whether to take college classes or enter the military at an early age, it is important for students to consider all of their options and make an informed decision. While a quick decision may seem like the best option, rushing into a decision often leads to regrets in the long run. Elective courses offer students a way to express their interests and figure out what they truly desire.   Through elective courses, students are able to explore different topics and open themselves to new possibilities. These courses offer a chance to learn about diverse areas, including the arts, American history, and science. By trying out different courses, students can deepen their understanding of their preferred subject and gain an insight into potential future paths.   In addition, elective courses can provide a new perspective on the complex world around us. By taking elective courses outside of a student's comfort zone, they can gain vital skills such as creativity and problem-solving. As a result, students will be better prepared for whatever career they plan to pursue.   To sum up, students should not rush into deciding which college classes to take or enter the military at an early age. Elective courses provide students with the opportunity to explore their interests and learn what they truly desire, gain knowledge on diverse topics, and gain valuable skill sets. Ultimately, taking the time to evaluate all of one's options is key to making an informed decision.		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I'm writing to you about students performing community service. This has become an issue because some students want to participate and others don't want to for certain reasons. I am writing you this letter to give you my opinion on what i think of this whole situation. I personally don't think that every student should be required to perform community service because some of these students might be handicapped or they could be sick. Also, if they don't want to then they shouldn't be forced to. For example, a way we could solve this issue would be to ask the students if they want to participate. Tell them that they could walk someone's dog, clean up parking lots in and around Marion, tutor another student, etc.  If they where to say no to that, ask them if there is anything else they would like to do like in and around the school to help out. For example, helping clean up the cafeteria after lunch, helping out one of the teachers in the classroom, etc. and tell them that they could instead of having to help with community service, they could do this instead. If they were to say no to that then just tell them that there's nothing else that can be done so they don't have to do anything.  Students could also get a letter from their parents and bring it to you and the note could state that the students parents don't want their child to help out. Or, the students may have too many things in there lives going on and they are too busy to help out with community service. Maybe, you could allow them to just come out and help whenever they want to and don't just force them to do it. That way those students who don't want to help right now, might decide later on that they want to and they could choose to come out with the rest of the students and help. Another idea would be to offer students extra credit for helping out. Maybe that way you could get a lot more students to join.  So, I've listed ideas in this letter for you, TEACHER_NAME, to think about. Students shouldn't be forced to do this if they really don't want to. They should be allowed to have free will just like the rest of us. So therefore sir, please take this letter to thought. A lot of students, parents, and even other teachers out there would appreciate you doing this. And thank you TEACHER_NAME for reading my letter. It means a lot!  Thanks,  STUDENT_NAME		0
The picture that has been roaming our society for 25 years and counting, is known as "The face on mars." The " Face on mars" has been put in hollywood films, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and grocery store lines. Many people believe that this face was created by aliens, and its not just a natural landform. But I can almost prove to you that this "face" was not created by aliens and is infact a natural landform.  First, If the face-like landform was created by aliens why would that be the only mark? Usually if the face was created by aliens there would surely be a way bigger mark. As well as there would be plenty more marks surrounding that face. This proves that this mark is simply just a landform.  Also, there is plenty of life-like landforms created with the surface of the area. Just so it happens to be on a planet doesn't mean there has to be a wild explanation to this landform. There is life-like landforms that sometimes look a a full body and there are some that look like half of a body. Many of those landforms have been scientifically proven to be just a landform. Also, with all the human shaped landforms we have all of them should be claimed to be created by aliens! Once again, there is no way this landform can be created by aliens. Yes it is indeed unusual but if humans cant travel to Mars how would aliens be able to travel to mars? It's impossible for aliens to make this landform.		0
 People make their own decisions because they don't want to be held accountable for their actions. Being responsible for one's own choices allows individuals to grow as people, with both successes and failures in life. People often fear making the wrong decisions and regretting them later, but failing with one's choices can lead to new opportunities and learning experiences. Taking responsibility for one's actions means accepting the consequences, both good and bad, and making the most of them.  When people take responsibility for their decisions, they are less likely to blame others for their mistakes. This is because they understand that their choices were their own and that they were responsible for the outcomes. It is important to note that not all decisions will lead to the desired results, but it is through these experiences that individuals can learn and grow.  Additionally, taking responsibility for one's decisions allows individuals to live with no regrets. They can look back on their choices and know that they made them with intention and purpose, rather than being swayed by external factors. This mindset can lead to a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction in life.  It is important to remember that getting advice can be helpful, but ultimately, individuals must make their own decisions. Trying new things and making mistakes can be a valuable part of personal growth and development. It is through these experiences that individuals can learn from their mistakes and become stronger, more resilient people.  In conclusion, taking responsibility for one's own decisions is an important part of personal growth and development. It allows individuals to learn from their mistakes, live with no regrets, and grow as people. By taking responsibility for their actions, individuals can make the most of both their successes and failures in life.		1
Having cell phones around can always cause distractions. Many people have died by using their cell phones while driving. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving a vehicle because they cause car accidents, they injure themselves, and they put other people in danger.  When people answer phone calls, text messages, sending, or reading messages it can be a risk because they aren't paying attention to the rode instead they are paying attention to their conversations. When people stop at a red light they start looking at their phones and don't pay attention when the light turns green. Taking your eyes off the rode is something that someone shouldn't do because it puts themselves in danger and not only themselves but other innocent people as well. Everyday people are dying because drivers are always distracted with their phones.  Many people work depends on a cell phone and many say that they always must be available. However, they cause dangers situations. Some people get bad calls like business issues can be stressful and dangers because of the conversation they are having. The conversation that they might be having may cause emotional reactions and it can lead to accidents. When people get messages or phones calls that upsets them it can lead to them losing the ability to focus on the road.  People don't put their full attention to the roads or when cars are passing by cause they're more focused on what they are looking at. Even texting while driving is more dangerous than drinking while driving. Drinking while driving is less dangerous because they are at least putting more attention to the rode than texting. They have said that mostly young adults are the ones to use their phones more while driving.  People know that they shouldn't use their phones while driving but they still end up doing it. They should ban people from using their phones while driving because it can make there be less accidents. People also choose to do something that they know it would be dangerous for themselves and for others that are driving. Talking or texting while driving is wrong, but people always choose to do the opposite of the right. If people don't stop using cell phones the number deaths and accidents will keep increasing.   		0
Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Although I do think that it really depends whether or not the student will take the classes seriously or will play around with the free extra time. I think it would still be beneficial.  For example,if a student wants to participate in an extra curricular activity that requires traveling the student can't do that unless he or she is taking classes online. However,If a student decides to take online classes but does not take extra activities then there is no reason for he or she not to attend regular school. For example, I personally struggle with this issue. I take modeling and acting as an extra activity outside of school. Being signed to an agency is hard because that requires me to travel to different states. Meaning I miss a lot of days in school, which makes it even harder because when I come back from a trip I'm usually behind and confused in classes. Although, I do miss a lot of school I still manage to pass and have good grades in my classes by self advocating for myself and explaining,and working something out with my teachers. However I do think that if I was in online school I would be able to travel more and have plenty more jobs. While still being enrolled in the school system. This is why I think that schools should offer distance learning options. It would really be helpful for students with extra Activities.		0
Dear Principal,  I do think that we should have community service hours required for our school. It is the best moral thing that schools teach and It really should be a requirement.  One reason for this is because students would be giving back to their community. They would be doing something to help the community and make it a better place rather than just playing Xbox or just fooling around.  In addition I think that it is a good idea because the students could actually learn lessons from different tasks they complete and if they do something that hurts the community they can see what it feels like to be the people that have to clean up the aftermath. This is more of a moral understanding than anything else of your community, your friends, and your family and how it affects them.  Finally, I think that kids would have an opportunity to get to know what their community is all about in the first place. If your like me and you pretty only socialize with your group of friends and not with really anybody else, it'll give the person a chance to meet really nice people in your community! Usually, people doing community service are really nice people.  So in conclusion, I think that community service should be a requirement to graduate from school. This conclusion was based off of moral feelings toward the subject.  Sincerely,  Students      		0
 Do you know that 80% of students who attend after school programs and receive additional support perform better academically than those who do not? After school programs provide students with the extra help they need to succeed, improve their grades, and give them more time to complete missing assignments and homework.  If a student missed a class lesson, they would have the opportunity to stay after school with their teachers and catch up on what they missed. Students can use this time to study with their friends and teachers for upcoming tests, receive additional help on difficult lessons, and improve their grades. This is a better way for teachers to explain lessons without disrupting the class and confusing other students.  Missing work done at school can be challenging for students, but with after school programs, they can complete it with their teachers and friends. They can also ask their teachers for additional help if they don't understand a concept. Some students believe that staying after school is a waste of time and that they won't receive any benefits. However, this is not the case. After school programs are a valuable opportunity for students to receive extra help and improve their grades. Teachers give their own time to their students to complete missing work, explain lessons again, and make sure students understand the material.  In conclusion, after school programs are a great opportunity for students to receive the extra help they need to succeed academically. They can improve their grades, complete missing work, and receive additional help on difficult lessons. It's important for students to take advantage of this opportunity and attend after school programs to help them succeed in school.		1
Meditation and mindfulness practices have become increasingly popular in recent years, with many schools incorporating them into the daily routine. While some argue that these practices have numerous benefits for students, others believe that they have no place in the school curriculum. In this essay, I will argue against the inclusion of meditation and mindfulness practices in schools, providing reasons and examples to support my position.  Firstly, meditation and mindfulness practices are not a substitute for traditional education. Schools are places of learning, where students should be focused on acquiring knowledge and skills that will prepare them for their future careers and personal lives. Meditation and mindfulness practices, while beneficial for stress relief and self-awareness, do not contribute to the academic development of students. In fact, a study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that students who practiced meditation and mindfulness had lower academic achievement compared to those who did not practice these techniques. This suggests that time spent on meditation and mindfulness practices could be better spent on academic subjects.  Secondly, incorporating meditation and mindfulness practices into the school day can be seen as a form of indoctrination. Many of these practices have roots in Eastern spirituality and religion, and some critics argue that they are inappropriate for public schools. For example, some meditation practices involve chanting mantras or focusing on a specific deity, which could be seen as promoting a particular religious belief. In a society that values religious freedom and separation of church and state, it is important that schools avoid imposing any specific religious or spiritual beliefs on students.  Thirdly, meditation and mindfulness practices can be seen as a way to pacify students, rather than addressing the root causes of stress and anxiety. Many schools that implement these practices do so as a way to help students cope with the pressures of academic life. However, this approach can be seen as a Band-Aid solution, rather than addressing the underlying issues that cause stress and anxiety. For example, instead of teaching students mindfulness techniques, schools could address the root causes of stress by reducing homework loads, providing more support for mental health, or promoting a healthier balance between academic and extracurricular activities.  Finally, incorporating meditation and mindfulness practices into the school day can be logistically challenging. Many schools struggle to find the time and resources to implement these practices effectively. For example, schools may need to hire trained instructors to lead meditation and mindfulness sessions, or purchase expensive equipment such as meditation cushions and sound systems. In addition, some students may feel uncomfortable participating in these practices, or may not have the space or privacy to do so effectively.  In conclusion, while meditation and mindfulness practices have their benefits, they have no place in the school curriculum. These practices are not a substitute for traditional education, can be seen as a form of indoctrination, can be seen as a way to pacify students rather than addressing the root causes of stress and anxiety, and can be logistically challenging to implement effectively. Instead, schools should focus on providing a well-rounded education that prepares students for their future academic and personal lives, while promoting healthy habits and stress management techniques that are grounded in scientific evidence.		1
 A cowboy who rode the waves refers to a person who had a successful career as a rodeo bull rider. The rodeo bull riding event is an annual event where cowboys compete to see who can ride a bull for the longest time without being thrown off.  The history of rodeo bull riding can be traced back to the early days of the American West. Cowboys were known for their love of adventure and their love of horses. As the cowboy culture began to spread across the country, rodeo events like this became more popular. Today, rodeo bull riding is considered a thrilling and exciting activity that attracts thousands of fans every year.  One of the most famous cowboys who rode the waves was Jessie Venture. Jessie Venture was born and raised in Montana and began his career as a cowboy at a young age. He quickly gained a reputation as one of the best bull riders in the world. Jessie Venture's daring style of riding made him a crowd favorite, and he won numerous championships over the course of his career.  Another cowboy who rode the waves was Chris LeDoux. Chris LeDoux was born and raised in Colorado and also began his career as a cowboy. He quickly gained a reputation as one of the most skilled bull riders in the world. Chris LeDoux's unique blend of style and speed made him a favorite among fans. He won numerous championships and was inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in 2008.  These cowboys who rode the waves were not just skilled at rodeo bull riding. They also had a love for music. Jessie Venture was an accomplished singer and songwriter, while Chris LeDoux was known for his country music. Both cowboys combined their love of music with their love of rodeo, and they became known as the ultimate cowboys.  The cowboys who rode the waves have left a lasting legacy. Their daring style of rodeo bull riding has inspired generations of riders, and their love of music has influenced the cowboy music scene. These cowboys will always be remembered as some of the greatest riders of all time.  In conclusion, rodeo bull riding is an exciting and thrilling activity that attracts thousands of fans every year. Cowboys like Jessie Venture and Chris LeDoux have left a lasting legacy in the world of rodeo and music. These cowboys who rode the waves will always be remembered as some of the greatest riders of all time.		1
I think that in our constantly changing society that technology has become apart of our everyday lives. Almost everywhere you go you will see some sort of smart device whether that being a smart phone, a smart watch, or a smart doorbell. Technology has changed and grown significantly over the last couple of years, but school is the same as it was a hundred years ago. Students are still mindlessly sitting in chairs for hours listening to lectures about things they don't understand or care about. Technology is in almost every aspect of our lives; our homes, our cars, our doorbells, and even in our fridges, so why not use it in education. I think that students should have a say in the way they are taught so if students want to attend class from home and are willing to do the work why not. I think that students should be able to attend classes from home because they would be able to learn more and get a personalized education and they would have more free time to just be kids.  I think that a lot of students in schools aren't learning anything because one they can't learn in the environment that they are in and two they don't learn the way the teacher teaches. If a teacher has about 150 students they will probably teach to each of those students the same lesson the same way. Half of those students probably didn't understand the lesson the teacher just taught maybe because the teacher taught it to fast or maybe because she explained it in a way that didn't make sense to the student. If you have a teacher who's teaching style doesn't relate to the way you learn what do you do? You ask for help, but some students are afraid to. If student were able to work at home they could talk to the teacher one on one and ask for help without being afraid and the teacher could learn about how that student learns best and possibly teach them better.  There are 24 hours in a day. From nine in the morning to four in the afternoon students are at school, that leaves 17 hours in which it is recommended that students get eight hours of sleep. That leaves nine hours not including the commute to and from school and the time you get up so you can eat breakfast, get dressed, and all the other things you need to do before you leave the house. So lets say students have about seven hours of free time to do with what they will, but now imagine if they could go to class from home. They wouldn't have to worry about traveling or getting up super early to make it to school on time. They could just wake up and open their laptops ready to do their school work that would give maybe nine hours of free time if not more. In that time they could do so much not just learn more but just have the time to relax and do what they want to do. I don't think students get enough time to just relax and chill out with there busy schedules, so I think that having school at home would give students an opportunity they never had before that would benefit everyone.  Some people say that if we let students attend class form home students wouldn't get their assignments done and would take advantage of this opportunity and do things they shouldn't. Yes I do think this would happen if there aren't rules in place so that if that does happen the people that didn't do the work will be punished not everyone by taking away an opportunity. There are always people who will take advantage of the system that is there to help people but don't let them ruin it for everyone.  I think that this would be a great opportunity for a lot of students and would change the classroom experience. Although some people say that if students attended classes from home they wouldn't do their work and wouldn't learn anything. I think that students would benefit from attending classes from home because they could learn more and have a personalized education and would have more free time. Schools should make attending class from home an option in there curriculum and reevaluate the education system as a whole. 		0
Living an active life and living a lazy life can be two very different experiences. While some people may prefer to spend their time relaxing and enjoying the simple things in life, others may thrive on being constantly on the go and seeking new challenges. In this essay, we will compare and contrast the two lifestyles and explore the advantages and disadvantages of each.  Living an active life can be incredibly rewarding. For one, it allows for a wide range of experiences that may not be possible if you are not constantly seeking them out. For example, if you are always on the go, you may have the opportunity to travel to new places, meet new people, and try new things. This can lead to a sense of excitement and adventure that may not be present in a more sedentary lifestyle.  In addition to the experiences that come with an active life, there are also many physical and mental health benefits. Regular exercise can help to improve cardiovascular health, increase strength and flexibility, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Additionally, being active can help to reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and increase energy levels.  However, there are also some disadvantages to living an active life. For one, it can be incredibly time-consuming. If you are constantly on the go, you may not have as much time for other important aspects of your life, such as family, friends, and personal hobbies. Additionally, being active can be physically demanding, and may require a significant amount of energy and effort to maintain.  On the other hand, living a lazy life can be much more relaxing and low-stress. For one, it allows for more time to focus on other important aspects of life, such as family, friends, and personal hobbies. Additionally, being lazy can be physically and mentally restful, allowing you to recharge and prepare for the next day.  However, there are also some disadvantages to living a lazy life. For one, it can lead to a lack of physical activity and exercise, which can have negative effects on your health. Additionally, being lazy can lead to a lack of personal growth and development, as you may not be constantly seeking out new experiences and challenges.  In conclusion, living an active life and living a lazy life can both be incredibly rewarding, but they also have their own advantages and disadv		1
As the debate over school schedules continues to be an ongoing issue, an innovative idea has been proposed: reduce the number of school days from five to four, and increase the length of each day to two extra hours. While this idea has drawn both support and criticism, there are many valid arguments in favor of the four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day.   First, a four-day school week would reduce stress by allowing students, teachers and staff more time to socialize, participate in extra-curricular activities, or pursue hobbies. The extra two hours per day would also allow teachers to dig deeper into their subjects and help students stay engaged and focused. Furthermore, a four-day school week would provide an economic benefit, as schools would need fewer personnel to clean and maintain the buildings. Plus, this would give families a bit of a break when it comes to childcare responsibilities, as they could use those days to plan activities, run errands, or simply get some much-needed rest.   Ultimately, a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day would be beneficial for everyone involved. Students would have fewer days to feel anxious and overwhelmed, while still having the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the subjects they are studying. Additionally, the cost savings for schools would be a welcome bonus. In short, moving to a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day represents an innovative way of ensuring students receive a quality education while reducing stress and providing a cost-effective solution for schools.		1
we are all zombies on these devices no one cares they make so many things easier for people to do and enjoy themselves. The way society shows us is that we all use phones like idiots and honestly, my opinion doesn't change because I know that many people have used their phones pretty stupidly and lose their life for it but honestly as long as you know how to control yourself you can use it really effectively and I'm gonna show you exactly how by using these two methods 1. use it when not in the motion of driving and 2. Keep your eyes out for police.  Driving is our main way of transportation so we need to keep ourselves safe and everyone else safe. the best way to do that is to keep our phones away keeping your phone is smart while driving because texting and driving is a big no-no in everyone else's eyes. The only reason why I think people need to follow this is because I've driven with people who have sat at the light because they were stuck on their phones and I had to tell them to drive so, to be honest, we need to limit ourselves to do it only when are stopped in traffic or we just parked up somewhere.  I don't drive yet but everyone should just know this rule or just follow it at all times watch for police, police are like enemies they protect the streets and I respect them for that but honestly, they should always be avoided I'm not saying avoid them at any means necessary but just keep seat belts on and don't text and drive that's the easiest way a cop will catch you so make sure to get wherever you need to go and just move on try not to get in any trouble.  And to conclude phones are really convenient devices that make millions of things easier for us day to day humans but we need to limit ourselves to just using it when not driving and only when it is really needed many cars nowadays come with their own little carphone technology that will speak to you and do stuff for you.  Apps like Waze make driving feel much safer and cars like teslas and the other cars I spoke about before can be great substitutes for phones while driving.       		0
Electoral College is where we pick our state electors to choose our president. We as citizen get to help choose our state's electorss when we vote. It's a benefit to keep our Electoral College in the government system.  After all, Electoral College do have their negatives. In the source "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer claims that "voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electorss." We are not voting for our own president, but choosing an electorss for our own state to go on and help us vote for our United States of America's president,but with an Electoral College every state get two Senators and one House of Representatives. Which divide everything equally. Our votes are counted by our population of people. So, the Electoral College shouldn't be change.  Mainly, Electoral College help us vote for our president. In the source "What is the Electoral College" by the Office of the Federal Register assert that the winner of the president is "election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens." The more popular votes our states is given the higher chance that president is going to be elected. "Majority of 270 electorsal votes is required to elect the president" out of 538 votes for a president to win. With an Electoral College each president have to get at least 270 electors votes from all the 50 states for them to be president.  Lastly, Electoral College have no runoff elections. In the source "In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President" by Richard A. Posner mentioned that with no runoffs there wouldn't be any "complicate the presidential election process." There will never be a tie votes between an election. For example, between Nixon and Clinton both got 43 percent popular votes which is a tie and hard to pick, but with an electors vote their votes are 301:370 which is a big difference.  In summary, Electoral College is a useful system in the government that should be kept in place. It has been used over the years and it would be a pain to change everything now.		0
Title: The Importance of a Research Checklist for Writers  Introduction: As an 8th grade student, I have learned that writing is an essential skill that can help me communicate my ideas and thoughts effectively. However, writing can also be a challenging task, especially when it comes to ensuring that my work is well-structured and free of errors. That's why I believe that using a research checklist is crucial for writers, and in this essay, I will argue why.  Argument 1: Organization and Structure A research checklist helps me stay organized and ensure that my writing has a clear structure. By checking off each item on the list, I can ensure that I have included all the necessary elements of a well-structured piece of writing, such as an introduction, body, and conclusion. This helps me to present my ideas in a logical and coherent manner, making it easier for my readers to follow along.  Argument 2: Grammar and Spelling A research checklist also helps me to identify and correct grammar and spelling errors. By carefully reviewing each item on the list, I can catch mistakes that might otherwise go unnoticed, such as subject-verb agreement, punctuation, and verb tense consistency. This helps me to present my ideas in a clear and concise manner, without distracting my readers with errors.  Argument 3: Citation and Referencing A research checklist can also help me to properly cite and reference my sources. By carefully reviewing each item on the list, I can ensure that I have correctly cited my sources and referenced them in the appropriate format. This helps me to avoid plagiarism and give credit to the authors and creators of the information I use in my writing.  Counterargument 1: Time-Consuming Some people might argue that using a research checklist is time-consuming and can slow down the writing process. However, I believe that the benefits of using a checklist far outweigh the extra time it takes to complete. By taking the time to carefully review each item on the list, I can ensure that my writing is error-free and well-structured, which can save me time in the long run by reducing the need for extensive revisions.  Counterargument 2: Overly Rigid		1
Imagination and knowledge are two essential aspects of our lives that are often intertwined. While knowledge is crucial for understanding and navigating the world around us, imagination is equally important for personal growth and development. In this essay, I will explore the importance of imagination compared to knowledge and argue that both are equally valuable in our lives.  Knowledge is essential for understanding the world around us. It helps us make informed decisions, navigate our surroundings, and interact with others effectively. Without knowledge, we would be unable to function in society or achieve our goals. However, knowledge alone is not enough to fulfill our potential.  Imagination, on the other hand, is the ability to form mental images, concepts, or ideas not present in our current physical surroundings. It is the power to envision possibilities, create new ideas, and solve problems in innovative ways. Imagination is what allows us to dream, innovate, and create.  While knowledge is important for understanding the world around us, imagination is what allows us to create and shape it. Imagination is what drives us to innovate and push the boundaries of what is possible. Without imagination, we would be limited to the world as we know it, and we would not be able to create or shape the future.  Furthermore, imagination is essential for personal growth and development. It allows us to explore new possibilities, challenge our assumptions, and expand our horizons. Imagination is what helps us develop empathy, creativity, and resilience. It is what allows us to see things from different perspectives and develop new ideas and solutions.  In conclusion, imagination and knowledge are both essential aspects of our lives. While knowledge is crucial for understanding and navigating the world around us, imagination is equally important for personal growth and development. Both are equally valuable in our lives, and we should strive to cultivate both in ourselves and in others. By doing so, we can create a world that is both informed and innovative, one that is shaped by our dreams and aspirations.		1
Summer projects is an excellent way for students to continue learning and to grow academically during breaks while having fun doing it. When teachers assign projects which is designed by them, it decreases the student's motivation to complete the project because students find it amusing to design and create their own projects and not the other way around. Another reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to research many topics which they could potentially be interested in. Summer projects during the break should be student-designed because it increases student motivation to complete the project, students are able to gain knowledge on something they came up with themselves, and they are able to have fun while conducting research on their own topics.  The first reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because of the increase in motivation. Students are motivated when they are interested in what the project is about. When the project is teacher-designed, student's lack the motivation to complete the task as they could be uninterested in the project the teacher had assigned them. Some students might assume the project will be tedious because the teacher is assigning it and as a result, feel unmotivated. For example, When the teacher assigns a project, it can be difficult to research and come up with ideas which leads to the students feeling stressed and confused on what to do regarding the project. But when a student designs their own projects, they probably already have an idea or information on the topic of their project. Another example is when students are assigned a project, and there is a choice to organzie and create your own project for extra credit, students are motivated to perorm well on the project. That is why schools should have students perform research on their own project topic because it motivates them to get it nicely done. An increase in motivation means an increase in the quality of the project and the thought of satisfaction while completing it  The second reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to gain a tremendous amount of knowledge as they are coming up with their own ideas on researching, creating, and completing their own projects. For example, during the break, multiple students travel out of state or out of the country. When the students go on vacation, they will locate lots of great topics and ideas to research on. Therefore, increasing the student's knowledge on the topic or idea of the project. This causes the students to become more erudite during the break and when they return back to school from the break. Although the students will still gain knowledge on a teacher-designed project, they do not gain a much broader view on the topic of the project. Another example is when a student works at someplace he or she enjoys working at and decides to do their project on that particular job. This is going to increase the sudent's knowledge as the student is researching more information about the job whilst also learning more about the place he or she works at.  The third reason why summer projects should be student-designed is because students are able to have fun while conducting a research on their topic. Students always want something fun to do; therefore, by designing their own projects, they are able to make it as fun as they want. When the teacher designs the project, the students would probably assume that it is dull. For example, when a student does something for fun over the break, they could do their project on what they did instead of doing a project on something they have never done before. Another example is when a teacher-designed project is assigned and the teacher is extremely facetious about what and what not to include in the project. When this happens, the students won't find the project to be amusing or interesting.  In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed as it greatly benefits the students in many ways such as motivating them, allowing them to gain more knowledge, and having fun whilst working on the project. When teachers design projects for their students, they are not allowing the students to fully expand into many areas but allowing them to conduct a research and work on their project in a way they want it to be done, which limits the students ability to be motivated to work on the project, to gain knowledge on the project, and to enjoy working on the project.		0
Have you ever talked to your friend about something and he Disagrees with your advice while you might think he's advice isn't valid but people have their own opinion and some can change your thinking.:This article I will show you why multiple Opinions are just better than one , first giving multiple opinions can Reduce bad behavior, second multiple opinions can show you things you didnt know you had. Thirdly Multiple opinions are just better because 3 brains are better than one.  Multiple opinions can reduce bad behavior, because if you are looking for an advice and you listened to an advice you like you will stick to it. A example, someone tells you to cheat on a big test and your ready to do it when someone overhears you and say don't do it there is always a better solution than cheating and starts listing out facts and this other opinion can make a huge difference in your outcome and change your perceptive to cheating on a test. Personally I have dealt with bad advice but I always have good friends/family to stop me from doing bad things so this passage can show you why opinions are really important.  Why multiple opinions can show you things you didn't know you have ,to elaborate my personal experiences have shown that some of my advice that I get are pretty bad and some other advice can make you learn and broaden your horizons. A personal example of mine is when I was bored at home and my friends told me to either make some food for them or go out and play and i reluctantly made the food, when I did make the food it turned out great. When that happened I started cooking more and now its a hobby I loved that I never knew I had. This show that multiple opinions can show you things you didnt know you have.  Why multiple opinions are just better because 3 brains are better than one, in more depth multiple opinions can separate bias nous because other peoples opinion can have different ideology. If you did survey 3 people for advice on getting good grades probably the things they would have said was pay attention in class, do homework etc while there might be that one guy that says just cheat and don't listen in class. If this does happen you might think who is bias here while it depends on your standpoint if you already support cheating you will pick that guy so that will be bias but have you ever thought that maybe just paying attention and studying would help. If you did take that route you will have multiple opinions to lye on and that can overall dissipate bias nous and also you can switch stand point to see whats right for you. This can show your route what stand point you like.  After all of this I support my claim and my thesis multiple opinions can Reduce bad behavior, multiple opinions can show you things that you didn't know you had, Multiple opinions are just better because 3 brains are better than one. Multiple opinions can change your life for the better, If you give people opinions I hope Its good ones and I hope to see that people that are reading this implement it into their lives .		0
Small acts of kindness are often overlooked and underestimated, but they can have a significant impact on others. These small gestures can uplift and positively influence the lives of those who receive them.  One example of a small act of kindness is a simple compliment. A friend or family member taking the time to genuinely compliment someone can boost their confidence and make them feel appreciated. This can lead to a positive chain reaction, where the person feels more comfortable and confident in their abilities.  Another example is lending a helping hand. Whether it's offering to help a neighbor with yard work or assisting a stranger with a heavy load, small acts of help can make a big difference. These actions show that we care about others and are willing to go the extra mile to make their lives easier.  Having a positive mindset is crucial when it comes to kindness. When we approach the world with a positive attitude, we are more likely to see opportunities for kindness and to take action. This can lead to a ripple effect, where more and more people become inspired to act kindly themselves.  Parents play a vital role in teaching kindness and fostering its presence in communities. They can model kindness by treating others with respect and compassion, and by encouraging their children to do the same. By teaching children the importance of kindness and its impact on others, parents can help to create a more positive and supportive community.  Research has shown that kindness can have numerous benefits for individuals. For example, a study by the University of California, Irvine found that people who were kind to others were more likely to experience positive emotions and better mental health. Additionally, a study by the University of Pennsylvania found that acts of kindness can lead to increased social connections and a sense of community.  In conclusion, small acts of kindness can have a significant impact on others. These gestures can uplift and positively influence the lives of those who receive them. By having a positive mindset and teaching kindness to others, we can create a more positive and supportive community. The research supports the idea that kindness can have numerous benefits for individuals, including improved mental health and social connections.		1
Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is a very experiencing and uniqe experince.  In the text Luke describes this oppertunity as an oppertunity of a life time.  In the text Luke also says " Besides helping families, I had the side bennefit of seeing Europe and China. So on top of helping famiies you also get to sight see and see places you would of never seen before.  In the text it also says boys play basketball and volley ball games in the empty holds of animals. So you will have extra time to do other things then work with animals.  In the text it said that Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. So you will have the time to tour and sight see.  In the text Luke also says "Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. He also adds to this by saying, so was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. So if you do not become a Seagoing Cowboy you could miss these amazing sight and doing these amazing things.  This is why becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is a life time experience.		0
Venus is our sister planet and we should know more than what we already know. The extreme conditions are a challange but the facts that would come from exploring Venus would be very insightful.  The extreme conditions that are on Venus will be a challange. The high pressure, heat, erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and lightning that strikes probes that try to land there are not the best situatuion to be in. We have not found material or built a robot that can handle all of that for a long period of time. The weather would take the robot out before it got really good info.  NASA may have found a possible solution to this obstacle. Using older technology might be able to handle the conditions. Also having newer technology to float 30 miles above the ground to minimize damage. The problem with that is we wouldn't be able to get close enough to get samples or to explore as much as we would be able to if we had a strong robot.  Being curious beings is challanging and difficult but it is fun to have something that isn't that easy. Exploring Venus our sister/twin planet will be hard and expensive but nothing we can't do. Sometime in the future, most likely we will be living on more than just our planet we live on now.		0
The debate over whether or not drivers should be allowed to use their cellphones while behind the wheel has been a very popular topic throughout recent years. With factual evidence to support both claims, people seem to be pretty evenly split when it comes to which side of the debate that they support. I personally believe that when driving, drivers should NOT be allowed to use their cellphones in any way, shape, or form. Driving while distracted by you cellphone is too dangerous and causes too many injuries and casualties to be allowed.  First of all, when you are driving and you have to perform all of your tasks for the phone manually, you are creating a distraction for yourself. This takes your attention away from the road and increases your chance of causing a wreck. According to the NSC, there are 1.6 million crashes and 390,000 injuries each year caused by cell phone usage while driving. This means that 390,000 of people's "loved-ones" were injured in a crash caused by texting and driving.  What if it was your "loved-one" that was about to become part of the statistic? What if it was you that was about to become part of the statistic?  Now, you might be thinking "Some cars now have the ability to connect the phone to the speakers via bluetooth, which gives the ability to talk on the phone while not being in contact." If you were thinking this, you would be right. This does indeed reduce the risks caused by holding the phone and doing everything "hands-on." But, you are still going to be taking attention away from the road and putting it towards the phone when you give a command or you make a phone call. Also, not every car has this feature, therefore some people would get distracted trying to come up with a solution of how to talk on the phone without being in contact with the phone.  What most people don't realize is that the solution is right in front of their faces- "Wait until you aren't driving."  Luckily, governments are realizing the dangers of distracted driving, as 20 U.S. states and territories have passed "hands-free" laws, which are laws that prohibit being in contact with your phone while driving. Even with this being in effect, there are still going to be people that will continue to text, make calls, and more while driving. There will still be injuries and deaths caused by distracted driving from cell phones. This is why I am a firm believer that the usage of a cell phone should be completely prohibited in any shape, form, or fashion while driving. It can wait.         		0
 Car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular around the world as governments strive to reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, and carbon emissions. While the idea of a car-free city may seem appealing, there are both advantages and disadvantages to such a solution.  One of the key advantages of a car-free city is that it would eliminate traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a significant problem in many cities around the world, causing delays, higher emissions, and increased stress levels for drivers. By removing cars from the roads, cities would be able to move more efficiently and reduce the amount of time that drivers spend stuck in traffic.  Another advantage of a car-free city is that it would reduce air pollution. Cars are a major source of air pollution, contributing to smog, acid rain, and other health problems. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities would be able to decrease air pollution and improve the quality of life for its residents.  However, there are also several disadvantages to a car-free city. One of the most significant disadvantages is that it would make it more difficult for people to access certain jobs and services. Many jobs require access to a car, making it difficult for people to commute to work without one. Additionally, some services, such as grocery delivery or food distribution, may be more difficult to provide without cars.  Another disadvantage of a car-free city is that it may not be feasible for everyone. Some people may be unable to walk or bike to work, and others may not have access to alternative modes of transportation. This could result in social and economic inequalities, as people with access to cars may be better able to access jobs and services.  Overall, a car-free city is an interesting solution to many of the problems that cities face today. While it has several advantages, it also has some significant disadvantages that need to be considered before it is implemented. Only time will tell if this solution will be successful, but it is certainly worth considering.		1
 Title: The Mysterious Face on Mars  Introduction  In recent years, scientists and researchers have discovered an unusual feature on the planet Mars. This feature is a large, elongated face that appears to be staring at the Earth from a great distance. Despite its striking similarity to a human face, the true nature of the formation remains a mystery. In this essay, we will explore the various theories surrounding the mysterious face on Mars.  Various Theories  One theory suggests that the face is the result of a meteorite or other impact that created the shape of the face. This theory is supported by the fact that there are other craters on the planet that are almost identical in shape and size. Another theory is that the face is a result of volcanic activity or other natural processes. This theory is also supported by the fact that there are many other similar formations on the planet.  Some researchers believe that the face is a result of a cosmic event that occurred millions of years ago. They believe that the formation was created by a massive asteroid impact that caused the planet to split apart and left a mark on the surface. Others believe that the face is the result of unknown extraterrestrial forces, possibly involving the existence of other life forms on the planet.  Despite the various theories, none have been proven conclusively. Scientists continue to study the face in hopes of finding evidence that could prove one theory or another. Alternatively, a new theory could be developed that explains the formation in a totally different way.  Conclusion  The mysterious face on Mars is a fascinating subject that continues to capture the imagination of people around the world. While many theories have been developed to explain the formation, none have been proven conclusively. As scientists continue to study the planet and the face, new theories may be developed that could change our understanding of the universe.  In conclusion, the face on Mars is a wonderful example of the mysteries that still exist in the universe. While the true nature of the formation may someday be revealed, for now, it remains a fascinating puzzle that continues to captivate and intrigue scientists and researchers.		1
Dear Principal,  Education should be a school's top priority, and part of having educated students is having students that are as knowledgeable as they can possibly be. Each kid has different subjects or activities that they excel at. Some may do well at math while having trouble in English, and others may be good at soccer but not so good in History class. If you change school policy and make it so that students can't participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a B average, you are preventing students from being their best at what they do or in other words, being knowledgeable in their activity.  Preventing kids from participating in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average will hinder their progress in improving their grades. Staying involved in physical activity has proven to improve test scores and health for that matter. The health of my classmates should be very important to you considering that a sick student cannot attend class. Kids with excess energy will not pay attention and that is why sports teams and physical activities are incorporated in every school. Taking that away from kids with a lower average than a B will not improve their grades or help them gain knowledge, instead their grades will most likely start declining more with the short attention spans in class. Therefore, decreasing the knowledge that they take in and making them less knowledgeable.  You should always encourage us students to try our best, and what if our best is at a sport? Taking away the right to play sports because of low grades will take away our effort in trying our best. Having a low grade in a subject that we aren't specifically doing well in, shouldn't prevent us from playing a sport that we excel in. We try our best in everything we do and it wouldn't be right to punish us by taking away an activity that we can excel in. To most of the students, sports mean everything to them and taking it away because of one bad grade will make them feel like their best didn't work so why should I keep trying. It defeats their self-confidence and willpower. This will make them slack off in class and therefore, decrease their knowledge.  I think that it is in your best interest to not change the school policy so you can have better, more kno		0
There are many different emotions that you go through on a daily basis. Some of them are pleasing motions and others aren't. Every emotion that you go through can be seen by other people through your facial queues. Facial queues are important in some instances, but they are not important for education.  The Facial Action Coding System would have a lot of uses on a set for a tv program or play. It could help make a set run more efficiently by automating ligh queues and what not. The opposite of that is true for schools. There is not a real good reason for schools to use funding to buy FACS because not every computer in the school needs one. It might be useful to have one on every external door to the school to aid with security but not on school computers. In paragraph 5 of the excerpt it states, "In fact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day." That sentence is explaining that humans already do what the FACS does, Furthermore we don't need a computer to read our emotions because we already do so.  Facial queues are important to everyday life. It is how humans read and help understand eachother. A FACS can be useful to help further security in schools, but not as useful to help students learn. 		0
I think government should change electoral voting to voting by popular vote. Americas government say every citizens vote counts but they are really only counting the electoral votes. Their was an incident in 2000 called "The disaster factor" according to source 2, this crisis let electors defy the will of the people. Some electors called "faithless electors" refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for who ever they want.  If we have electoral votes we might as well not have popular votes. People spend there time going to vote for the president they feel is better for this country yet, when they get home and watch the polls they realize the only votes they are counting are electoral. Growing up i was taught that every vote counts be voting just to vote for electorals just so they can vote for our president doesn't seem like im voting for myself it seem like they are voting for us.  In source 3 their counter-claim is that we should keep our electoral colleges, they also say "it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors." basically telling on themselves by saying our votes don't matter or count.  In source 2 they say "the electorsl colleg is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning" the electoral college isn't fair at all, if it was based off popular votes, candidates will have what it takes to win in any state they want.  In conclusion, in my opinion government should remove the electoral college, It is not a fair system to U.S. citizens every citizens vote should count so it should be abolished.    		0
We have all heard the proverb that "first impressions are the most lasting," but is this always the case? Considering one's own experiences, it is not difficult to make the case that first impressions are not always fixed and can be changed over time. This can be attributed to a variety of factors, such as rudeness, shyness, and a change in personality.   Take, for example, a person from any place who is perceived as being shy or reserved upon first meeting them. Even though their initial interaction may be uneventful, as time goes on, that person may develop friendships or trust relationships with others, allowing their true personality to shine through. This can easily change the opinion of others and may even give them a greater appreciation for the person's character.   When it comes to first impressions, rudeness can often be a major factor. We all know that this is something to be avoided in any social situation or business establishment. Even when someone is initially rude or abrasive, there may be more to the story than first perceived. Taking the time to get to know a person and understand their background can often create a different perspective on their initial rudeness.   Finally, it is possible for a person's personality to change over time as they go through different life experiences. Despite initially coming across as one way, these experiences can lead to growth, empathy, and knowledge that may alter how people view them.   In conclusion, first impressions may be possible to change, and there are many factors to consider in this idea. To this end, it is important to keep an open mind and get to know people on a deeper level. Only then can we truly change our views and give everyone a second chance.		1
dear, senators of USA. in the manner of arguing i say that you should change to popular voting. you should change it because we (the people) know if somebody will make a good president. the people want to vote for somebody from how they look. for how someone would run our country. sure some people would want to change and go by the electoral voting. but the popular voting is they way to go.  when the people vote for a president, they don't want to vote for an elector to vote for a president. they would want to actually vote for the president, not an elector! Obama had 61.7 percent of the electoral votes on him (said in source 3, paragraph 18). most of the congress wanted him to be a president. not many people (citizens) wanted him. but not the congress, they all wanted him. and they always get what they want.  like it says in source 2, "the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational." what this person says is true. this voting system has been going on for quite a while. from the 1960's even till now. maybe even further back. its time to change this system. its to old. it may work and all that. but its time for a change. it's also unfair. the own congress gets to choose who their president is? why not the people? they're the ones who are going to have to go by what he says. we have to go buy the prices, follow the rules, and do as we're told. why shouldn't we be the ones to vote for our president.                                            		0
 The electoral college is a system used by the United States to determine the president of the country. It was established by the framers of the Constitution in 1787 and has been used in every presidential election since then. However, there are some who argue that the system is outdated and does not reflect the will of the people. In this essay, we will explore the arguments both for and against the electoral college, and determine whether it is an effective way of choosing the president.  On the one hand, proponents of the electoral college argue that it is a fair and representative system. The system gives each state a certain number of votes based on its population, so larger states are given more say in the election than smaller states. This means that the president is elected by the entire country, not just by states that are heavily populated. Additionally, the electoral college ensures that the president is elected by a panel of electors, rather than by voters themselves. This prevents the candidate with the most popular vote from winning the election, which could lead to a candidate who does not have the support of the wider population.  On the other hand, opponents of the electoral college argue that it is an outdated system that does not reflect the will of the people. They argue that the system is based on outdated population numbers and that it does not take into account recent changes in demographics. Additionally, they argue that the electoral college can be unfair, as some states are given more influence in the election than others. This means that a candidate with less popular support in a particular state can still win the election if they win enough support in other states.  Another problem with the electoral college is that it can lead to a lack of voter turnout. Since the outcome of the election is often determined by a small number of votes in swing states, many voters who do not support the front-runner may feel that their vote is not important. This can result in low voter turnout and a lack of representation for certain groups of voters.  Overall, it is clear that the electoral college is a highly divisive issue. There are strong arguments on both sides of the debate, and it is difficult to come to a definitive conclusion. However, one thing is clear  C it is time for the United States to consider modernizing the electoral college and ensuring that it reflects the will of the people. This is essential if we want to ensure that our future presidents are elected in a fair and representative manner.		1
I would have to say that I am in favor of moving forward and progressing towards driverless cars. There are quite a few reasons why I believe it's a great idea. After the idea is perfected, roads will be much safer, The cost of transportation will go down and also it could possibly make transporting on roads much faster.  The idea of this "driverless car" is quite astonishing, but once it is perfected it will open up doors to new oppurtunities in transporting on roads. For example, the car would be able to sense cars that a human could possibly not see. This would make the amount of car accidents go down.  Also, some states have already allowed computer driven cars on the road, as it says in the passage. This demonstates that these driverless cars are becoming safer everyday. It also says in the article that manufacturers believe the number of states to allow driverless cars is only going to continue rising as they advance there search for safer and possibly cheaper cars or solutions.  One other reason that i believe that these cars are a great idea is because it says that the cars can make for cheaper transportation. For example, it states in the article that Sergey Brin, cofounder of google, believes that the fuel amount needed in these futuristic cars will be half of what we use today. We would be able to do less harm to the environment by using less fuel. Also, Sergey Brin states that taxis would be more flexible and safe. This reduces the risk of having a taxi driver that might put you in danger. Although these cars will be much safer there are many more reasons to agree with driverless cars.  One final reason I believe in driverless cars itll be much faster to get from place to place. For example, a autonomous car could go a certain speed much higher than the current highway speed limits and sense any danger. It would be able to go at a much faster speed but also keep the roads jusr as safe.  All in all, there is still much research to be done for these cars to be perfected and be able to be driven on the roads legally. Although, if we continue to advance in driveless cars the generations after us will be see roads much different then we do today. They will see a much safer, faster, and cheaper way of moving around. 		0
Cell phone use while driving should be avoided.  While cell phones have become an essential part of modern life, the dangers they pose when used by drivers are clear. When a person is driving, their full attention should be on the act of operating the vehicle safely. Unfortunately, cell phone use inherently divides a driver's attention between conversations or tasks on the phone and their surroundings on the road.   Numerous studies have shown that cell phone use while driving can impair a person's ability to drive as much as having a blood alcohol level near the legal limit. Reactions times are slowed and it is harder to remain fully aware of other vehicles and potential risks. Texting, in particular, poses extreme dangers as eyes are directed away from the road for prolonged periods. The risks are clear - cell phone use is associated with an increased chance of accidents on the road.  Some argue that hands-free use should be permitted if the phone is voice-activated or used with a headset. However, the cognitive distraction of a phone conversation can still disrupt focus behind the wheel. Other drivers and pedestrians should not have to risk their safety so that a call can be answered. In emergencies, pulling over safely to use the phone is always the better option than endangering lives.  In conclusion, cell phones present an avoidable risk on the road and drivers should not use them in any capacity. Our roads would be safer if attention was focused fully on the task of driving instead of being divided. While phones are difficult to live without, public safety must come before any non-essential call or text. For the protection of all people who share the roads, cell phone use should remain banned for drivers.		1
The face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. The "Face on Mars" has became a pop icon, it has starrd in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocerys tore checkout lines for 25 years. Its the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. " It reminds me the morst of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," says Garvin. "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."  When,  NASA unveiled the image for all to see, the caption noted a "huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth." The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.  Though, When Mars Global Surveryor flew over the Cydonia for the first time, Michael and his Mars Obiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all  For example: As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size." "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see where they were." The picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.  Although, some people people think it was created by aliens or that few scientists believe the face was an alien artifact, but actually its just a natural landforms common around the American West.               		0
 I believe that the idea of allowing students to graduate in three years is a great one, and it is something that should be considered by all schools. While some may argue that students do not learn enough in three years, I believe that there are ways to address this issue and ensure that students are still able to receive a comprehensive education.  One way to address the concern that students may not learn enough in three years is to focus more on assessments. By providing more opportunities for students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills, schools can ensure that they are meeting the necessary standards for graduation. Additionally, schools can offer more advanced courses and programs to help students who want to graduate early.  Another way to address the issue is to provide more support for students who are struggling to keep up with their coursework. This could include tutoring, mentoring, and other forms of assistance. By providing students with the resources they need to succeed, schools can help ensure that they are able to graduate in three years with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed.  Overall, I believe that the idea of allowing students to graduate in three years is a great one, and it is something that should be considered by all schools. By providing students with the support and resources they need to succeed, schools can help ensure that they are able to graduate early and move on to the next stage of their lives with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed.		1
I think that it should be a grade c average cause half of the kids cant do will in there classes and some kids wont be able to do the sports or other activities cause some of them cant keep there grades up cause the stuff they do in there class are hard for them some kids can keep there grades up to a c and it will kinda be hard for some kids to keep it up above B and there probably wont be a lot of kids in sports cause they cant keep there grades at a B and some of the other activities probably wont a lot of people to cause they cant keep there grades up and i think it should be a c average cause keeping your grades up to a b will probably be hard for some kids and if there is smart people who don't like sports wont even sign up for it and if the smart people don't like the other activities there wont be anybody in the activities or in the sports and i think it should stay to a grade C average cause it will be hard keeping your grades up to a grade B so it should be a grade B average for everybody can sigh up and do the sports and other activities.		0
Dear Principal,  I am completely parallel to your idea of changing the school policy, which argues that students must have at least a B average to participate in activities. This idea will help students to become ambitious, responsible, and less likely to take things for granted.  While extra curricular activities are important, academics play a large role in the grand scheme of things. Most often, pupils seem to become comfortable with the idea that they can slack off in class as long as they are the star if a sports team. As much as sports are important, academics are what carry you through high school, college, a first job, and so on. Though a majority may not think of this, math and writing are used multitudes of time every day. Between getting morning coffee and emailing friends, these subjects play a vital role in each and every life of the student body. Succeeding in academics may be important, but motivation is needed to achieve such a thing.  School activities are most often taken for granted. Speaking from personal experience, the idea of not being able to participate in sports or extra curricular activities is a foreign concept. Though most may not be familiar with the idea of earning the right to be on school teams and such, it will be a wake up call.  Most students these days think that achieving above average grades is overrated, or do not think to attempt doing well at all. Sports and activities, on the other hand, are something people who are not as academically inclined usually prosper in. Having to earn good grades to enjoy these activities will motivate pupils to try their best.  In conclusion, sports and activities come second to education. Though participation in these activities are fun, academics are what get people through life. With the motivation to achieve academics, a pupil earns the right to join in sports teams and such. Forcing students to attain a B average will force students to come face to face with these truths.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME      		0
State senator.....Keeping the Electoral College would greatly benifit our country.  The electoral process is a very important process that is needed.  The Electoral College consists of 538 electors.  With majority of 270 votes are needed so there is a good chance of getting a fair shot to win.  Each candidate running for president in a state has to have there own group of electors which eguals out the odds.  The electors are chosen by the candidates political party.  In most states they have a winner takes all system but Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportion.  The certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presidental candidate in the state and shows which electors will be representing your state at the metting of the electors which helps us to know who had won the presidental election.  Voting for a state election of who will turn elected for president. When voting you would have to vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors to pledge for Kerry.  Voting for a president is like voting for a state elector.  Even though a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it has only happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.  The reason is that the winning candidate shares the Electoral College invariably exceeds his shares of the popular vote.  The Electoral college requires an apresidental candidate to have transregional appeal.  The residents of the other religions are likely to feel disenfranchised and that their votes does not count and that the new president will have know regard for their interests.  That he is not really there president.  The winner of all methods of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates like as seen in the election of 2012.  They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters on average and that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidate as the most thoughful voter should be the one to decide the election.  The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constituion.  Having the electoral College avoids the problem of electiong in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.  It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potental voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, Democrats in Texas for example or Republicans in California.  Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.  As some would say the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  The best arguments in favor of it are most likely assertions without much basis in reality.     		0
Dear Florida senator, I'm a young student, and no I don't haye much of a background in political ideas or things, but I know we should keep the Electoral College. This old process was created to make electing a President easier and faster, which I belieye it does.  Now, the Electoral College has 538 electors, but a majority of 270 electoral yotes is required to elect the President. Some will argue that we aren't yoting for a President but we're yoting for the people, or electors, behind them. I would say that they aren't wrong, but we aren't just yoting for those electors, we are yoting for the whole idea behind their campaigning. We don't yote for the person, we yote for the idea that person agrees to carry out. By haying this process, we can focus on getting swing states yotes. The yotes of these states matter the most, in my opinion, because they are likely to swing at any minute. As said in " In Defense of the Electoral College: Fiye reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President ", "swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that the are going to decide the election." This helps ayoid runon elections because the small states are likey to just yote for the most popular President, knowing their yote won't really make a difference.  Most states haye a "winnertakeall" system that giyes all of the electors to the winning candidate. Howeyer, there are a few states that haye yariation with the "proportional representation" idea. The "winnertakeall" system actually works really well. Other parts of the Electoral College has it's problems but not this one. With this process it makes it easy to giye all of the yotes to one person, this means all of the state will be on the same page and not fighting with itself. This process y. proportional representation, is better in my opinion because it's quicker and helps make the presidential process one step easier.  And lastly, it's a tradition to use the Electoral College. The pedigree for this process was created a really long time ago by some of the most outstanding leaders in our country. The article " What Is the Electoral College?  " states that, "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a yote in Congress and election of the President by a popular yote of qualified citizens." The process we created as the United States, has its up and downs but it is one of the longest standing traditions we haye. Hopefully you take my letter in to consideration. Thank you for reading.		0
I think it would be bad to have community service. I choose this reason because some kids never have time to do anything and making them do community service would just waist their time to have fun. Plus what if some kids have after school activities and must go to them then they would get in trouble. That would cause a lot of trouble in the school.  If kids just went to community service everyday they would be tired when they got done causing kids to be lazy in the future and end up being overweight. Then they would end up not going to work and jobs wouldn't be getting done. If jobs didn't get done then we wouldn't have any new technology and we would slowly die out of the human race. No one wants that to happen do they?  If kids went to community service then their parents wouldn't really get to spend time with them because the kids would be working after school and they would be too tired when they got done working that they would go straight to sleep when they got home. they wouldn't be able to spend time at them on the weekend because the kids would want to have the time they could to play without having to go to work. Then the parents would be sad because they never have any time with their kids and the family would slowly fall apart. That's another reason why community service is bad.  What I'm trying to say is that you should not tell students to do community service. You don't know what they have going on in their lives. They could be a professional basketball player.		0
This article is about making Mona Lisa smile but the main thang for this article is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables reserchers to use computers to identify human emotions. It is saying in the article that "new software has been developing that improves accurace in perceiving the emotions of others. This new software,the Facial Action Coding system,has promising applications for a variety of industries." One of this details tell use that Mona Lisa is"83 percent happy,9 percent disgused,6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry."This all stared when the subject of Leonardo da Vincil's of his renaissance panting of Mona Lisa, when"at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions. This new"software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Hung of a advanced science University and how he thinkes people and computers can communicate. It all comes to geter with 3-D nd the model of the face and it shows the 44 major muscles in the model, it also shoes one or more muscles is called an action unit. 		0
Mona Lisa Smile's  The new technology to read anyone facial expressions to how much would it take to identify a human emotion.  They use Mona Lisa smile's to see how its calcutlies, but its show she's 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. Identify the movements of the muscles, but a Dr. Paul Eckman classified a six basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness. Like Dr. Huang said, " the facial expressions for each are universal observe, even though individuals often show vary degrees of expression".  The emotion recognition software tracks these facial movents in real life faces or a painted of someone face. It can identify mix emotions by weighting the differents units in da Vinci painted.  Actaully humans perform the same impressive everyday. probably could tell a friend feelings just noticing by their face. some of us would have trouble noticing their emotion traits like happy, sad, worried, and scared. Like a sciencist would says, " a classroom computer could recognize when a students becoming confuse or bored". Dr. Huang predicts " then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructors".  In Dr. Huang notes most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, and cumputers need to understand that too. To a experts a face don't lie about a muscle clue are sometimes use to spot a smile is not being truthful.  A drama coach contantin a stanislavsky for his actor to reproduce a smile and frowning as a way of creating emotions on stage. Even showing empathy for that person to make them feel great for them selfs.  Faces could reveal so many emotions even through body it can be noticable or not but we all human that show so much emotions.              		0
 In today's society, students have varying levels of certainty about their future career goals. While some students have a clear idea of what they want to study or become when they are older, others may not be as certain. It is important to note that each student's situation is unique and depends on their personal circumstances and interests.  On one hand, students who are confident in their career goals may have had an interest in a particular field since they were young. They may have grown up admiring firefighters or police officers and have always wanted to pursue a career in those fields. Additionally, family members who have served in the military or have been firefighters may also influence a student's career goals. These students may feel a sense of pride and fulfillment in following their dreams and pursuing a career that they have always been passionate about.  On the other hand, students who are unsure about their career goals may need help finding their interests. Some students may not be aware of their passions or may need guidance in exploring different options. Additionally, students who are shy or hesitant to try new things may be less likely to take risks and explore different career paths. In some cases, students may also be pressured by their parents or peers to pursue certain careers, even if they are not interested in those fields.  In conclusion, while some students may have a clear idea of what they want to study or become when they are older, others may not be as certain. It is important to recognize that each student's situation is unique and to provide them with the support and resources they need to find their passions and pursue their career goals.		1
Changing the policy to where only students with a B average to join sports is not a good idea to me. The reason I think this is a bad idea is because most of the students that are athletic have at least a 2.0. I like the way the schools are only requiring a 2.0 to join. If you do this and change to 3.0 you will most likely have less people join or try out for the teams. I think the most important thing here is the students should be athletic.  Most students are only in school for the athletic stuff. If you raise the GPA most students will drop out. They will drop out for the fact that they cant make it a B in the time they need it. C average is good enough because it is average.  My friends that are athletic and join Football or Baseball are not that smart. I'm not saying they are dumb, they just don't hold the highest GPA. They make a 2.0 cause that's where they are in school. They don't have to bust their butts just to join, when they can just go to a community center and pay and don't have to worry about their grades. If you change it to a 3.0 most students will drop out and think they will end up being a famous Football player or Baseball player ect.  Just like the passage said, most students have a C average. Why would you change it to B and just lose all the people who actually participate? Most students that don't already participate are in the streets smoking weed or doing other drugs. These sports help kids stay off the streets and keep them clean. They have something to enjoy and do.  Why would they wanna do drugs right?  Those are the reasons why I think changing the school policy would be a bad idea.		0
The wheel was the first step that took society into the making of the mobile car. Today millions of cars are made each year to help humans transport around the cities and streets around the world. Every vehicle that is powered by gasoline emits carbon dioxide, this gas is very harmful for the environment, it causes the ozone later to slowly dissolve and it also causes acid rains. Traffic jams is one of the many effects of having too many cars in a certain populated area. Debt has also been an influential part in the quantity of cars around the globe. Car usage and production should be drastically reduced to ensure a better future for all living things in the Planet Earth.  Furthermore, Global warming has slowly made its toll on Earth, most of which has been produced by the Carbon Dioxide gases in the atmosphere, this gas is a mayor green house gas. Over the years cars have been more extensively used and have a great percentage in world contamination, As stated in article 1 paragraph 5 "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the united states". This being, if car production and usage are reduced, Earth will have positive reactions to this change. The levels of global warming will also be reduced all around, this will help us conserve our north and south poles for a longer period of time, keeping safe all the animals related to that area like penguinzs and polar bears.  In addition, Traffic jams arent the most pleasant place to be, due to the fact that they're unpredictable and in most cases highly annoying. Information from passage 2 paragraph 14 states that "congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france", this was due to oderly assigning days in which certain cars with certain license plates can drive through the cities of france. Less congestion means higher percent in mobility all around, this can greatly effect a 3 hour traffic jam to a simple 20 minute ride. Coming and going from places can be a brease, and this will also facilitate extra time for other potential activities. Reducing car usage and congestion can also lead to less accidents and car crashes.  Moreover, Leasing or buying a new car can come heavy on the pocket. Financial debt has been trounced ever since a currency started, debt is unpredictable sometimes and can happen to any individual. Having the latest model of a car can be a luxury only some can afford, the individuals who try and cant afford it ussually end up in debt, as reinforced in article 4 paragraph 32 "Cash Strapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway". Ussually some individuals "bite more than they can chew" and this can harm not only one indivual, but the economy as a whole. Reducing the mayor debt that can come from car leasing can improve a counrtys economy and benift milliones of individuals.  Concluding, many reasons show society to reduce the usage of cars. One being that gasoline and petrolium powered cars can contaminate the planet Earth, melt our poles, destroy the ozone layer and cause harmful weather effects. Also, the reduction of cars can lead to the decongestion of cities in which indiviuals can more easily and freely move around adding time for them to use as they like. Lastly, the economy can have a mayor boost if car reduction and usage from leasing can occur. In conclusion, the reduction of car usage and production is a great benefit for every individual who lives on Earth, and can lead to many great outcomes that will help members of society enjoy a better life style and have a safer future.		0
I think the auther is being very un biased about wether or not we should go to venus. It can be riducolusly dangorous and will kill anyone that steps foot on venus. They talk about how Venus is hotter then Mercery which si the planet closest to the sun. Venus is hotter because of the pressure and dnesity that the atomoshere carries.  Also the fact that the pressure is so bad that if you but a submerne on Venus it would instantly liquafy as if it was nothing. That makes a great deal when trying to get there. Id otn doubt that anyone is not finding out the mos that they can when going to venus but I dint really think it would be a great idea sense there isnt much chance of survival. Going to Mars sound my relable to me. The idea of hovering over venus would make much more sense do to the fact that anyone who steps foot on Venus would most likley die. But there must be tons of risks to even just hovering over the planet.  I do belive that we should study venus but i dont think we should do it at the expensie of peoples lives. Maybe we could invent a high tech rover ot explore the outside of venus. People dying probably wouldnt help anything. Stuying it from affar is the best way for things to go without people dying.		0
Many countries and places are starting to reduce their usage of cars. In multiple places they are to considered "car-free" or they have ensued partial car bans, even going as far as setting a specific day to "Car-free Day". The issues in most of these places is the reduction of the smog that is thought to be produced by diesel vehicals. The fights against polution are really starting to take effect in a multitude of places, such as, Vauban, Germany. Paris, France and Bagota, Colombia. And their efforts against polution is really starting to take ahold and become popular.  In Vauban, Germany- The people of this high class community have completely given up their vehicals. In Vauban, street parking and other car related items are forbidden in the "experimental new district". The main thoroughfare however, is one of the few places on the edge of the city where car ownership is allowed. But, there are only ever two places to park. A large set of garages at the very edge of the development. Where said car owner would be required to but a space and a home for 40,000$. Just for a parking lot.  Resulting factors from this Car-Free suburban, people seem to be happier without their vehicals. Vauban's residents seem to rather enjoy "the swish of bicycle tires, the chatter and laugter of the wandering children, drown out the occasional distant motor." Vauban is to be considered a main component of a movement called "smart planning". When finished in 2006 57 percent of it's residents sold their vehicals to move into the residence.  Germany's efforts in the past two decades have never been as successful as Vauban has been. With its 5,500 residents withing a rectangualr square mile, it is considered to be on of the most advanced experiments in low-car/carless suburban life. Germany has been attempting to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transport. Whether it be bikes, walking, skates or some form of physical transport. Near by these carless suburbs, they place stores along a main street near the suburb and not in some mall miles away on a interstate/highway.  Even though Germany is trying to create a utopia of carless suburbs there are still places that still thrive on the dream of large New York-ian style suburbs, private garages and spread out homes. These were the deam towns of the 1950's. Granted some of these ideas are still highly appealing to most places, places are staring to look more and more Vauban-like.  In Paris, France- Paris enforced a partial driving ban on it's residents to help clear out the choking smog, which is rival to that of Beijing, China. Paris officials ordered motorists with even-numbered license plates to keep their cars at home or they will be fined 22 euros or 31$ in American currency. The same ensued for those with odd-numbered plates the next day.  Due to this ban and fine on automobiles, almost 4,000 people had their cars impounded due to their reactions to getting a fine. Granted in the same token street congestion was down nearly 60% in France's capital. France, and Paris officials blammed diesel vehicals for their abundance of smog, although there is a tax that favors diesal gas instead of regular gasoline. So in turn to this gas tax, diesal made up 67% of all vehicals in France.  Unfortunately due to the high percentage of diesal vehicals the Paris has more smog that any other European capital. Although this ban did have a few consiquences, delivery companies complained of lost revenue. While people with plug-in cars, hybrids, and cares carrying three or more passangers. People found that public transit was completely free of charge during the experimental period of this car ban. The smog thankfully cleared just enough that the ruling French party to rescind the car ban for odd-numbered plates a few days later.  In Bagota Colombia- Colombian officials set to spread a program across to ohther countries. Millions of Colombians hiked, skated, biked, and or took buses to work durring car-free day. For a period of three years Colombia has dedicated one day to car-free day, all violators would be fined 25$. In a city of 7 million. The goal is to reduce and promote alternative tranportations to and from work, school, home, and to reduce smog levels umungst the city.  Despite the heavy rains and grey skies, the turnout was more than expeced. And for the first time, two other Colombian cities joined into the event, spreading it further than ever. Officials from other countries came to Bagota to see the car-free event and were exstatic. Claming that the people of Colombia were generating a revolutionary change, and it's crossing borders.  This day has been a work in progress ever since the mid 1990's. Bagota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. The most any Latin American city has ever seen in years past. An abundance of parks and sports centers have popped up, sidewalks that were small, worn and pitted have been completely replaced with smooth broad sidewalks and paths. Even new upscale dining and shopping districts have popped up due to this car-free day.  Goals set by President Obama are seemingly being unveiled as time passes due to studies suggesting that Americans are buying fewer cars, and all together driving less and less as time passes by. With the United States being one of the worlds largest car capitals, it seems that love for cars is dwindleing with efforts to keep down polution and smog levels.  The most accurate assumption today as to why the US's love and total buying of cars has dwindled so drastically is due to the recession that we had experienced. Cash-stapped Americans couldnt afford to buy new vehicals and that seems to be a persistant happening as the years pass. Unfortunately major car companies are starting to suffer due to this fall of people indulging in a car purchase.  Companies such as Ford and Mercedes are already starting to "rebrand" themselves as mobility companies and reorganising their product with wider varieties. Not only has car buying dropped, so has the rate of people between the ages of 16-39 getting a license. Most people are turning to car-pooling, walking or public transportation to get to their jobs, or other places, so in turn, getting a license is in not in the forefront of their mind.  Many countries are getting on the bandwaggon of fighting against polution, ensueing laws against driving all together, creating temporaty or partial bans. And they see a difference in their smog, polution levels. These people/countries are taking the innitiative to take care of the major underlying problems to much bigger problems such as global warming and problems of that nature. There are changes happening, and these changes are benefiting everyone.    		0

When exploring the benefits of working in a group versus working alone, it is clear that there are many advantages to engaging in collaborative work. Group projects can provide a diverse mix of ideas, skills, and perspectives that can enhance the output of the task. Working in a team also allows for strong communication skills to be honed, which can be beneficial in both an academic and professional setting. Furthermore, group work can also be more efficient, as tasks can be delegated among team members and achieved faster than working alone.   However, there are also disadvantages to working in a team due to conflicting opinions or lack of clear communication. It is therefore important to familiarize oneself with successful techniques for group work such as properly outlining the task, understanding the strengths of each group member, setting clear goals, and creating guidelines for communication. By following these techniques, you can ensure that the collaborative work experience is successful and that the group can achieve their shared goals.		1
In the late 1800's in was a huge deal to have a car, only rich people had them. Today it is a necessity to have a car, if you dont have one it is a big deal. But not everyone enjoys diriving some people want to not have to drive to live in an everyday environment. There are so many pros to having a walkable society, one being pollution.  In new York city there is millions of people, and millions of cars. When you have that manny people needing to get places most people drive. But that causes a problem it makes polution a big thing in these big cities, cars cause polution and people think i need a car to be able to get around. Thats not true, engineers these days are trying to make more of thyese "walkable comunities." A walkable comunity is one that can be travfersed by foot and does not require a car.  If you were to walk everywhere that you normally drive You would be burning a massive amount of calories. This in turn would keep people in shape and in better health and thats always a plus. If every one in a comunity is healthy then everyone would live long and every one wants to live longer. More people living longer means more people in the comunity more people in a comunity. more people in a comunity means more people working and leads to a higher production rate.  In the end cars limit the growth of humans by causing polution and people that are not in shape. Polution is a big problem in the world today and this is a way to stop it. People in america are becoming over weight and lazy if peoplewere to just bike or walk where there going it would help out the world greatly. So please next time you need to drive down the road, just grab a bike or even walk to you destination.    		0
The ability for examples, actions, reasons, and personal advice to positively influence others is vast and multifaceted. In many cases, one of these methods can be excellent for encouraging or motivating another person.   For example, providing a relevant or relatable example can help someone to envision a goal or understand an idea more deeply. Actions, such as leading by example, can also be beneficial in reinforcing the idea that positive behavior can be rewarding.   Providing reasons for why a course of action should be taken, or why a certain result is desired, can help create understanding and spark interest in the subject in question. Further, providing personalized advice tailored to the individual can help show that their opinions and voice matter and can help to hone in on the best course of action.   Ultimately, using examples, actions, reasons, and personal advice to influence others positively can be extremely beneficial, as evidenced by countless successful relationships and teams.		1
Our world has became a world that revolves around technology and cars, and it's now starting to show how the affect of these products are tareing away our ozone. Limiting the amount of air pollution can help decease the green house affect.  All over the world people use vehicle to travel all over the place for their daily needs. People are not aware of how close they really are to the things they drive to. If we could just eliminate the amount of usage we use on cars and walk to the places near us we can help with future damage to the earth. In the excerpt Paris bans driving due to smog ,Robert Duffer shares how paris banned there cars for the better of the world. He states "after days of nearrecord pollution,paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city". By banning the car uses they have made people healthier and the air much cleaner.  What we dont know is that we use about 100 to 150 gallons of gas a week, and its taking its toll. The excerpt paris bans driving due to smog states that "last week paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter am per cubic meter compared with 114 in brussels and 79.9 in london, reuters found." Meaning that we are using so much more than we need.  The End of the car culture states that " many sociologist believe it willit will have a beneficial implication for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of america's emissions, just behind power plants". that the environment is taking the toll for our wrong doings, and the environment is change because of the new partials in the air, and its not changing for the better.  Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota, Andrew Selky portays how contriving in healthier and better for you, by stating that "it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polution". The world could use a little more walking instead of riding. By taking a walk or a hike or even riding a bike is not only healthier alternative but it would make people much happier, which could help decrease the vilolance ratings.  By eliminating cars from our daily lives can help with getting rid of our polluted air and help getting our ozone from detriating. The world is suffering and we really need to help get it back to health. Our cars are emitting terrabe thing that are bad for our health and the eniorment so thanks to small countries contibuting to the limitations we are now starting to relise that we need to change for the better.		0
Advancements in modern technology allow people to understand more about their personal career, health, and education goals than ever before. These advancements have also made communication extremely accessible, giving people the opportunity to talk online through forums, audio, and video chats from wherever there is internet connection. While some would argue that learning in a building is the optimal way to earn an education, classes from home can create a more flexible schedule for students and teachers that can be beneficial for those with jobs, extracurriculars, health complications, or even travel time.  There are plenty of reasons why attending classes from home can be advantageous for students. One prominent reason: travel. Students take the bus from all over the area, some waking as early as 5:00AM to get breakfast and out the door, only to arrive hours later. Similarly, students outside of bus zones must be dropped off or drive to school on their own, potentially taking time from their parent's mornings or arriving late. For many students, this problem could disappear by taking online courses that don't require specific arrival times, and even provide learning for days when travel weather isn't optimal.  Like past generations, today's students are extremely passionate about extracurriculars: be it music, sports, or theatre. Additionally, students also have jobs or apprenticeships that will aid their careers in the long run. Many are already set on developing their future careers, meaning that specializing in their passions is more important than core classes. Students may dedicate hours out of their daily lives to jobs, arts, volunteer work, etc., which poses the risk of falling behind on schoolwork. By having classes from home, students can get all their classwork done at times most available to them, while stressing less about working on what they truly love.  Many enjoy school for the social aspect, and think enrolling in online courses would take away from interactions available in a physical building. Others are more introverted, and get tired of seeing people 24/7. It is also important to remember that many students suffer from health complications such as depression, long-term illnesses, eating disorders, or anxieties that require treatment and make thriving in a school environment difficult. Online courses can be beneficial to all types of people. Think: if less time is spent on travel, other students aren't posing as learning distractions, and all work is assigned in advance, students will have more time to gather with friends, relax, or work with a treatment team to help improve mental and/or physical health. Some students complain they won't ask teachers questions face-to-face outside of class; however, with e-mail and instant messaging, it's easy to get in contact and often a faster way to get caught up on work.  Online courses can be beneficial to all students. By pacing themselves and freeing up time wasted from an average school day, students can spend more time doing what they want rather than feel stuck in the trap of a building. 		0
There are many compelling reasons for limiting car usage, which can have significant benefits for both individuals and society as a whole. Reducing reliance on personal vehicles can help improve public health, lessen environmental impacts, and ease traffic congestion in urban areas.   One of the primary advantages of limiting car use is the positive impact it can have on public health. According to Passage 1, automobile dependency discourages physical activity and promotes sedentary lifestyles. By opting to walk, bike or take public transit instead of driving whenever possible, individuals can incorporate more exercise into their daily routines. This extra activity can help combat issues like obesity and reduce the risk of chronic diseases over time. At a broader level, decreasing car emissions through less driving would also aid efforts to improve air quality in cities and reduce the health problems associated with pollution.  In addition to promoting better health, limiting car usage has important environmental benefits. As described in Passage 2, personal vehicles contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution. Every mile driven results in the release of carbon dioxide and other emissions that damage the climate and environment. By making alternatives to driving more attractive and effective, overall emissions can be reduced, helping efforts to combat climate change and protect natural resources for future generations. Even small reductions in individual car trips, if adopted widely, could cumulatively make a meaningful difference.   Finally, reducing car usage can go a long way towards alleviating traffic congestion in highly populated areas. As noted in Passage 3, traffic jams drain billions from economies yearly due to lost productivity and wasted fuel. They also lead to increased levels of driver stress and frustration. Expanding public transportation networks and making communities more pedestrian-friendly not only appeals to health-conscious citizens but also takes many cars off the road. With fewer vehicles competing for limited road space, congestion levels decline and commutes become less stressful.  In conclusion, limiting car usage through alternative transportation options yields significant societal and environmental benefits that improve both individual well-being and community livability. While personal lifestyles need to shift, even small changes adopted widely can cumulatively make a meaningful difference. An overall reduction in automobile dependence is likely necessary to promote more sustainable development into the future.		1
I don't like it that us students has to have a B average just to play sports because most students has a C average i don't think it is right. Its wrong for you to change the policy because it will be hard to play sports or other activities and keep a B average. I know school work is more important than sports but sports in what I am trying to get a scholarship in.  I think we should just keep it as it is a C average to play sports and if we fail then its our faults not ours you can kick us off of the team or whatever until we get our grades back up. I think it would be easier in us just to keep it as C average i know life is hard and we have to learn but try to make it as less painful as possible.  If you want to change the rules than you can but you will be seeing a lot of athletes quitting because lack of getting that B average. I know you want us to do good in school and do good in sports and in school but its hard when we have to have a B average and get into shape for football, baseball, basketball. Etc.  The only way your going to be seeing a bunch of athletes is if you decide to keep the average at a C average. I know this letter may not mean anything to you but please listen and keep it the way it is. you shouldn't change it just to make kids do better in school you should kelp kids achieve in life in school and in sports.		0
 A cowboy who rode the waves: is this a paradox? Is it possible for a cowboy, traditionally associated with the rough and rugged terrain of the Wild West, to ride the waves of the ocean? Yes, it is possible, and in fact, there are many cowboys who have made their careers as professional wave riders, blending their cowboy skills with their love of the ocean. In this essay, we will explore the lives of these cowboys who rode the waves, their experiences, and how they managed to combine their two worlds.  One such cowboy is Kelly Slater, a professional surfer and twelve-time world champion. Slater grew up in Florida, near the ocean, and from a young age, he was fascinated by the waves. However, his love for surfing was not the only passion he had. Slater was also a horseback riding enthusiast and even won a few rodeos before turning his attention fully to surfing. Slater's experience with horses and rodeos gave him a unique perspective on ocean riding, allowing him to take his skills to the next level. He combines his love of the ocean with his cowboy skills to create a unique and exciting sport.  Another cowboy who rode the waves is Pedro Flores, a pro rider who grew up in California. Unlike Slater, Pedro had no experience with rodeos or horses before he started surfing. However, his love of the ocean and the waves quickly became his passion, and he spent every spare moment on the water, honing his skills. Pedro's hard work and dedication to surfing eventually paid off, and he became a professional surfer.  Pedro's journey is a great example of how anyone can pursue their dreams, regardless of their background or previous experience. With hard work and determination, Pedro was able to turn his love of the ocean into a career. Pedro's cowboy background may have influenced his perspective on the ocean, but it certainly did not stop him from becoming a successful surfer.  In conclusion, cowboys who rode the waves are a fascinating example of the power of passion and determination. These cowboys were able to combine their love of the cowboy life with their love of the ocean, creating a unique and exciting sport. They demonstrate that it is possible to pursue your dreams, no matter what your background or previous experience may be. So, the next time you see a cowboy on the waves, remember that they are not just blending two worlds; they are also inspiring others to pursue their dreams and passions.		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I think it is a very good thing for all kids our age to do community service. It helps out with pollution and helps keep our town clean.  Some kids like to do it but some kids don't. Most of us think it takes time away from fun activities we do over weekdays and weekends. I highly suggest that we make a sign-up board in the cafeteria for kids who want to work certain hours. I think Wednesday through Saturday is suitable. We can sign up and pick put 5 to 10 people we want to be in our groups. I think groups will help this problem.  I think most kids don't like it because there not working with their own very close friends. I honestly feel that way too. We all want to have fun and enjoy helping out.  Now as far as the helping out with Elementary kids goes, I think we can do the same thing. We can all come up with fun ideas for the kids and do it with them. On summer days we can do fun activities outside and have food and drinks. I think the School board wont mind if we use a tiny bit of money on pizza or chips. If they do I think we could chip in some money. When it is cold and winter we could do activities in the classrooms. We can have movies and hot chocolate. We can also bring board games for the kids.  I hope you really consider this letter. I feel it's a good way to help out,  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
if schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, they should be student-designed projects because students get more creative, wide-range of ideas, and just a higher chance of students completing their project during the summer break. if it was to be teacher-designed, students can follow the rubric created by their teacher.  Student-designed projects creates more creativity for students. there are so many things a students can project on. students already have such creative minds; teacher-designed will only limit that.  Also, We would have a wide-range of ideas to choose from. they dont just have to follow the teachers rubric and instructions.  Lastly, Students will most likely complete their project during summer break if it was something they came up with. during the summer the last thing im worried about is doing homework for school. im going on vacations, trips, parties. it be student-designed i can implement my project into my summer hobbies, making it fun to do.  In conclusion, schools should create student-designed projects rather than teacher-designed projects.       		0

Dear state senator,  "It can be argued that the  Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying thier state-Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.... But of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about on-half the eligible American population did vote in [2012's] election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."-  "paragraph 23" "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing the president"-by Richard A. Posner  If the president was elected by popular vote then the voting would truly be up to the people and not electoral votes given to each state. that puts a limit on it. If the president was choosen by a popular vote then it would be more of a demacratic society like we are expose to be. A Electoral college is not democratic at all the people aren't voting for the president directly and they dont even use the peoples votes in the count. If they do they count it less then they do when the state representitives elect the president. the only true way to see "what the people want" is by switching to only a popular vote: it is ran by the people, voted by the people, based by the people. haven't you ever heard the term " Give the people what they want."? Well what are we waiting for? It's time to change our voiting systems and fast before we hit a whole in the Electoral College. The constitution states "We the People", what happened to the people when it comes to voting, we get to vote but we aren't voting for the president (directly) like they have the U.S. citizens thinking. We are voting for someone to hopefully vote for our choice. My only question to you senator is, why hasn't the Electoral College been abolished yet? The people even know that their vote will have no effect right now, like it says in paragraph 23, source 3 "knowing their vote will have no effect." Last I checked the peoples vote is expose to have the whole effect... thank you for you time senator. I hope to see changes soon!!             		0
Dear principal,  I think it is very unfair that you are doing this. It is unfair to all of the students here because some of them are trying as hard as they can the keep their grades up and still do what they like. Student should be allowed to play a sport if they want because it is their life if they want to do sports more and school work less then let them do it. This is also unfair to parents because they have to pay for sports and school and their kids should be allowed to do what they want. If students are getting a c average they should be able to still play sports and make sure their school work comes before everything else. The teachers should give the students another chance and try to help them more. Maybe the teachers could have the students come in for extra help or get them a touter after sports to help them and try to get their grades higher. Students are always excited to do things with their friends after school. Are you really going to take that away from them. If the students don't get to do things like that they might turn to other things and end up failing school and dropping out. I know a principle doesn't want their students doing that so i think you should really think more about this before you go and make this decision.  Please think this over.  A student.		0
Limiting Car Usage: Environmental and Social Benefits   There are compelling reasons why limiting car usage could positively impact communities. Reliance on personal vehicles as the primary mode of transportation creates various issues related to traffic, pollution, and public health. By promoting alternatives like walking, cycling, and public transit, citizens and leaders can help address some problems facing modern cities and suburbs.  One major advantage is improving air quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As the passages note, vehicle exhaust contains harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and carbon dioxide. The latter is a contributing factor to climate change. When there are fewer cars on the road each day, the levels of these substances in the atmosphere decrease. This enhances environmental sustainability long-term. It also means less smog and better breathing conditions for residents including children and the elderly.  In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage could lead to healthier lifestyles. The passages discuss how over-reliance on automobiles has contributed to less physical activity and higher rates of obesity. By opting for active transit like biking or walking short distances instead of driving, people incorporate more movement into their daily routines. This in turn promotes cardiovascular and overall wellness. Communities may see public health outcomes improve as non-communicable diseases linked to sedentary living become less prevalent.    Encouraging multi-modal transportation also helps tackle traffic congestion issues confronting many urban areas. When driving is not the only viable choice, there will be less vehicles competing for road space during rush hours according to the provided sources. This relieves pressure on infrastructure and makes commutes more efficient for those who still need cars. It could even support local businesses if shoppers feel comfortable walking or cycling around commercial districts.  In summary, limiting car usage yields environmental, health and quality of life advantages when alternatives are accessible. Pursuing a balanced mix of transportation modes allows communities to prioritize sustainability, well-being and efficient systems all at once. With collaborative efforts, cities and citizens can work to curb reliance on personal vehicles and reap multiple long-term societal benefits.		1
Limiting car usage nowadays is very well for the enviroment. Not using cars so much lowers polution, and is a great way for humans to start interacting with one-another again.  The "Car-Free cities" started in the suburbs of Germany. Almost everyone completely gave up their cars. P2 L1-2 states that stret parking and drivewats and home garages are generally forbidden. If you are not completely car-free you pay $40,000 to buy space to park you car(s) along with a home.  Statistics say that 70 percent of families d not own cars anymore, and 57 percent actually sold their cars to move to Germany. Heidrun Wlter stated "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way".  In Paris, due to near-record pollution, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.  On certain days motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. the other days same rules apply to odd-numbered license plate owners.  The more cities that start doing a ban on driving cars' or use more enviroment healthy cars are helping reduce pollution and other toxins in the air. p43 states that the Ford company is already making changes to their cars/trucks to make them more enviromentally safe.  The rate of Kids and aduts between the ages of 16-39 getting their licenes and permits have dropped drastically within the past few years. With communication the computers and telephones, teens and alduts feel connected by talking on these devices and don't feel the need as much to drive to go see a friend and find it easier to stay intouch.  In Bogota, Colombia millians of people hike, bike, skate or took buses to work durin a car-free day. It was the third year that cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Wihout Cars in the city. The turnout was large, despite the occasional rain they ecieved, that didnt stop the colombians for doing what they did.  "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" said Carlos Arturo Plaza. Two other Colobian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the Day Without Cars event. The citites are generation a revolutionary change in the world.  Parks and sports centers have bloomed throught the city, sidewalks have been repaired and rush-hour has been cut.  The United states' has realized a drastic change in driving. Fewer people are getting their licenses. as of 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in 1995 (P32 L9-12).    		0
Dear, State Senator  I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. What is the point of voting if the Electoral College decides who wins? Using popular vote means the citizens would actually decide on who would win. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. Who picks the electors in the first place? The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state.  Sincerely,  The Voters    		0
Introduction:  The face on Mars has been a topic of discussion for many years. Some people believe it was created by aliens, while others think it is just a natural landform. As a scientist at NASA, I have studied the Face and believe that it is just a natural landform. In this essay, I will provide evidence and claims to support my argument.  Body:  Claim 1: The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.  Evidence: According to the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars," the Face is just a mesa, which is a flat-topped mountain. The author states that the Face is "a flat-topped mesa with a triangular shape." This proves that the Face is not a man-made structure, but rather a natural landform that was formed by geological processes.  Claim 2: The Face on Mars has been distorted by shadows and lighting.  Evidence: The article explains that the Face has been distorted by shadows and lighting. It says, "When the Viking orbiter took the first picture of the Face in 1976, the lighting conditions were just right to create the illusion of a face." This shows that the Face is not really a face, but rather a trick of light and shadows.  Claim 3: The Face on Mars has been studied by scientists and found to be a natural landform.  Evidence: The article mentions that the Face has been studied by scientists using high-resolution images. The author says, "In 1998, NASA's Mars Global Surveyor took a new picture of the Face, which showed it to be a flat-topped mesa, not a face at all." This proves that the Face is not a man-made structure, but rather a natural landform that has been studied and verified by scientists.  Conclusion:  In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. It has been proven by scientists and experts that the Face is not a man-made structure, but rather a mesa that has been distorted by shadows and lighting. Therefore, it is not necessary to believe that the Face was created by aliens. As a scientist at NASA, I believe that we should focus on studying the geological processes that formed the Face and other natural landforms on Mars.		1
As a high school student, I am constantly under pressure to do well in my classes and extracurricular activities. This is why I strongly advocate for meditation and mindfulness practices to be implemented into the school day. These practices will not only help students reduce their stress levels but will also improve their overall well-being.  Firstly, meditation and mindfulness practices have been proven to reduce stress and anxiety levels in individuals, especially students. In today's fast-paced world, students are expected to perform well under a tremendous amount of pressure, which can lead to high levels of stress and anxiety. According to a study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health, students who practiced meditation showed lower levels of cortisol, the hormone that is released during stressful situations. Therefore, by incorporating these practices into the school day, students would be able to reduce their stress levels and perform better academically.  Secondly, meditation and mindfulness practices have also been proven to improve focus and attention spans. In today's digital age, there are countless distractions that can easily pull students away from their studies. Meditation and mindfulness practices teach individuals how to focus their minds and be more present in the moment. By teaching students these techniques, they will be able to stay more focused on their studies and achieve better academic results.  However, there are some people who argue against meditation and mindfulness practices being included in the school day. Some say that meditation is a religious practice and that it should not be taught in a secular school environment. However, I disagree with this argument because meditation does not have to be a religious practice. It can be done as a form of mindfulness and does not have to involve any religious beliefs or practices.  In conclusion, meditation and mindfulness practices should be incorporated into the school day because they can help reduce stress and anxiety levels, improve focus and attention spans, and ultimately lead to better academic results. It is time for schools to start recognizing the importance of mental health and well-being and to provide students with the tools they need to succeed academically and personally.		1
When you go to vote for the president are you actually voting for the president? With the Electoral Collage system your not realy voting for the candidate directly, your just voting for someone else to vote for you. Is that realy how voting should work? What if the candidate with less votes wins and is a terrible president.  Say you vote for an elector and he loses, then what is the point in your vote. Everyones vote should count right? But with the electoral college system not everyones vote counts towards the presidential election. What about those few republican voters in a population that is mostly democratic. Thats why the Electoral college system should not be used anymore. In the 2000 election Al Gore actually had more votes than George W Bush, but because of the Electoral college system George W Bush was elected because he had more electoral votes than Gore. The Article "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses or the system are wrong" by bradford Plumer states "the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters". What about all those other voters whos electors didn't win, shouldn't they have a say in who our leader should be?  The only person you would trust with everything on the line is yourself right? So why would you want to trust someone who you have never ment with something as important a your vote. If you asked 100 people if you could vote for them if they just told you who they wanted to vote for, most likley 99 or all of those people would say no. But they are realy just going to vote for someone who will vote for them. The article "In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President" by Richard A. Posner states " it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely". Can we realy trust "rarley" for when we are deciding on the future of our country! We must be certin that the right person is chosen for the job. It docent matter if your female, male, white, black, hispanic, human, or not human, if your the more popular vote you should be elected.  What if the wrong person gets voted in office. What if the person with the majority of the votes still docent get elected to office and it turns out to be disaterous for our nation. When your electing the president your electing the person who is going to lead our nation for four years! The person who gets elected needs to be favored by everyone. Lets say that the electoral college never exsited and Al gore gets elected in 2000, our country could be in a much better state then it is now. We wouldn't be in as much debt, and mabey we wouldnt be fighting a war in afganistan, but we would never know because the electoral college voted the less popular candidate in office. The article "What Is the Electoral College" by the Office of the Federal Register states " Most states have a "winnertakeall" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate". But shouldnt the winner take all for the majority votes of the whole country? There is alot of lost votes because of the electoral college system.  There are endless arguments for both sides. But with a decision as big ass who should be the leader of our country, we cant trust any system that has even the slightest chance of failing. The wrong candidate can get elected at any given election with the electoral college system. That could lead to disaster or even worse.		0
Dear Principal,  This policy is unreasonable, it is because some kids that love sports only have a c average and are trying their hardest. Also when you take away sports and other activities from students, you are taking away their exercise. When you take away a students exercise you could make them have a risk of death. Also some kids might have a disorder that will keep them away from doing their work, and can only get a c average. And those kids with disorders might love sports or other activities, and you are keeping them away from that. Wouldn't you feel bad knowing you would be taking away something that other people love to do.  Also what could happen is that the people that can only get a c average could get mad or jealous at the people with a b average or better. So that would cause a lot of problems in school. There could be more fights then usual. Or people could just stop caring about their grades if they cant get better then a c average trying their hardest. This problem could get you fired because it wouldn't be a good school.  So say some kids at your school are having a rough time at home and the only thing that makes them happy is sports. But they only have a c average because of their home life. They wont be happy ever again if they cant do what they love.  What happens when a kid that has a b average, gets one bad grade and goes down to a c average in the middle of the season and is the best player?  All I'm saying is that it wouldn't be fair to the students if you were to follow through with this policy. Too many kids love sports and have a c average.      		0
The world is constantly changing, and with it comes the advancement of technology. While technology has brought many benefits to society, it has also brought some negative consequences. One of the most significant negative consequences of technology is the reduction of human contact. Although it may seem counterintuitive, limiting human contact due to the use of technology can have several positive effects on our physical and mental health, as well as provide important information about the world.  Firstly, limiting human contact can help improve physical health. With the rise of social media and other forms of digital communication, people are becoming more sedentary and less active. Spending hours sitting in front of a computer or phone screen can lead to a lack of physical activity, which can contribute to a host of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. By limiting human contact, people are forced to engage in more physical activity, whether it's going for a walk, playing a sport, or simply taking a break from technology to stretch.  Secondly, limiting human contact can also help improve mental health. Technology has become a major source of stress and anxiety for many people. The constant need to be connected to our devices can lead to feelings of FOMO (fear of missing out), social isolation, and depression. By limiting human contact, people are able to disconnect from technology and focus on their mental health. This can involve taking a break from social media, turning off notifications, or even going on a digital detox.  Finally, limiting human contact can provide important information about the world. Technology has made it easier than ever to access information from all over the world. From news articles to social media posts, people are constantly bombarded with information. However, this information can often be overwhelming and difficult to process. By limiting human contact, people are able to focus on the information that is most important to them, whether it's staying up-to-date on current events or learning about a new hobby.  In conclusion, limiting human contact due to the use of technology can have several positive effects on our physical and mental health, as well as provide important information about the world. While technology has brought many benefits to society, it is important to be mindful of its negative consequences and take steps to limit our use of it. By doing so, we can improve our overall well-being and lead healthier, happier lives.		1
In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This is due to a number of factors, including the increasing cost of owning and operating a car, the environmental impact of car exhaust, and the health risks associated with sitting in traffic.  One of the most obvious advantages of limiting car usage is the financial savings. Cars are expensive to purchase, insure, and maintain. They also require regular fuel purchases, which can be costly, especially in areas with high gas prices. In addition, parking can be expensive in many cities. By limiting car usage, people can save a significant amount of money.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is the environmental impact. Cars emit a significant amount of pollution, which contributes to climate change and air quality problems. Reducing the number of cars on the road can help to improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Finally, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on public health. Sitting in traffic has been linked to a number of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. By walking, biking, or taking public transportation instead of driving, people can reduce their risk of these health problems.  There are a number of ways to limit car usage. One option is to live in a walkable or bikeable neighborhood. This means choosing to live in a community where most of the errands and activities you need to do can be accomplished by walking or biking. Another option is to take public transportation. Many cities offer a variety of public transportation options, such as buses, trains, and subways. Public transportation can be a great way to get around without a car. Finally, you can also carpool or use ride-sharing services, such as Uber or Lyft. These services can help you share the cost of driving and reduce the number of cars on the road.  Limiting car usage can have a number of benefits, both for individuals and for the environment. By choosing to walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving, you can save money, improve air quality, and reduce your risk of developing health problems.		1
Hoping for a mere 538 people to vote for our nations president seems like an unfair way of voting. The Electoral College is a process of voting in which 538 electors vote for the new president for our nation, where 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Which ever elective has the most votes from states is the winner.  I believe that if the Electoral College was abolished, then we can have a more fair way of voting. Sure, The electoral college has some perks like a certainty of outcome, but there is more negatives on keeping it. If we got rid of the Electoral College for good and replaced it for a classic "most-votes wins" election then the nation can have a clear view to who their votes go to. This way, votes aren't decided by popular electoral votes.  The president should win over the most of our country with good qualitys that people want to see. People need to open their eyes and see "When you vote for a candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors." (Posner, In Defense of the Electoral College) If you vote for your favorite candidate you are voting for the state to win by popular vote. We should keep it simple. Add up everyones vote for whom they voted, and who ever has more votes wins.  "The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."(Plumer, The Indefensible Electoral College) It says it all, when the Founding Fathers made the Electoral college, the country was a lot smaller than it is today. The Electoral College was needed because there was a chance that the election could be tied. Today, the country is huge. The chance of a tie 1 in a trillion chance. I feel that we should give it a try, and abolish the College. This nation stands by freedom, and voting should be a choice.    		0
 Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to discuss the topic of the Electoral College and its effectiveness. As a responsible citizen of the United States, I believe that this system is important in ensuring that the president of our country is elected fairly and representative of all Americans.  The Electoral College was established in the Constitution to balance the interests of smaller and larger states. Each state is allocated a number of votes based on its population, and in order for a candidate to win the presidency, they must receive a majority of those votes. This means that candidates must focus on winning over voters in all states, not just those in densely populated urban areas.  There are those who argue that the Electoral College is outdated and that election by popular vote is a more appropriate method for selecting our president. While there is appeal in choosing the president based solely on the popular vote, it fails to account for the importance of rural areas and smaller states. These areas often provide significant contributions to the economy and culture of the United States, and they should not be overlooked in the election process.  Furthermore, the Electoral College provides an incentive for candidates to reach out to undecided voters and to campaign in a variety of locations, not just urban areas. This encourages candidates to consider the needs and interests of all Americans, not just those in densely populated areas.  It is also important to note that the popular vote does not always accurately reflect the will of the people. In some elections, popular vote may not reflect the will of the people as it may be due to issues such as voter fraud, voter turnout, or candidate behavior. In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is a vital component of our democracy and that it serves a purpose by ensuring that the president is elected based on the interests of all Americans, not just urban areas.  In closing, I urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College in our democracy and to support its continued use in future elections. I believe that it is a fair and representative system that provides a balanced view of the needs of all Americans.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Dear Senator,   I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to instead elect the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed with the intention of giving smaller states more influence, today it can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This undermines the principle of one person, one vote.   Supporters of keeping the Electoral College argue that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing only on a few heavily populated areas. However, research shows that candidates still concentrate campaign efforts and resources in a handful of swing states that could vote either way. The interests of voters in non-competitive states are often ignored. Switching to a popular vote system may encourage candidates to campaign across the entire nation and address issues important to more Americans.   It is also argued that smaller states would lose influence without the Electoral College protecting their voices. However, their number of electors is still based on population size. A popular vote would simply weight each vote equally rather than risk awarding a candidate the presidency despite losing the popular vote nationwide. Citizens in less populated states currently have disproportionate influence simply based on where they live, rather than one citizen, one vote.   A popular vote could increase voter turnout as more people would feel their ballots directly influenced the outcome. Currently, voters in non-competitive states may feel their votes do not really count. This could strengthen representative democracy. While an Electoral College victory still requires winning multiple states, the college can contrary to a candidate receiving the most votes nationally. In a system designed around principles of self-government, the outcome should reflect the will of the people. For these reasons, I believe a national popular vote would be a fairer system that better upholds the core democratic value of one person, one vote.		1
There are many advantages to having a car. such as being able to go drive places with your friends or even driving across the country, but there are also a lot of down sides to a car. such as paying for gas money, paying for ensurens, or even paying for the car its self.  If you happen to live at the beach or in the city there is really no reason for a car. Almost every thing at the beach or in a high populated city is either within walking, biking, or busing distance. This way you save money and you can get a good exercise.  Also polution is very bad in the world today. In france dieseles make up 67 percent of vehicles. which dieseles are known as the most poluting vehicles/gas in the world.  The day without cars campaign that began in bogota in the mid-1990's was a great idea! I think that america should adopt this campaign and put it in to action. This "day without cars" would not only cut down polution and get people out side execising, but could also even save life that could have been taken due to car accedents or people geting hit by drunk drivers while walking.  So those are just some of the reasons why I encourage limiting car usage and promoting alternitive choices for transportation.            		0
Politicians and the public have argued for years over one burning question: Should the Electoral College be discontinued? I believe the Electoral College should not be used in the United States anymore. To understand the faults within this system, one must understand the system at its basic level. The Electoral College is a system that consists of 538 electors. Each state has a different amount of electors, granted on the size of that state's population. When the election is held, the voter votes for the electors, not the candidate directly.  The first fault one can find while examining this system is the "winner takes all" policy that most states have. In paragraph seven of the first source, the article states, "Most states have a "winnertakesall" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate." This system seems unfair, especially in states where the vote for electors is won by a small margin. The votes cast for the candidate who lot the electoral votes in their state are not counted in choosing the president, which hinders the ideals of democracy in this country. In paragraph nine of the second source, the article reads," according to a gallop poll in 200, taken shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College, won the popular vote but lost the presidency." This crisis in 2000, when George W. Bush won the electoral college, but Al Gore won the popular vote, displays the lack of clarity with this system. This election was a prime example that the president is not chosen by the popular voice, but rather by the Electoral College, which does not accurately represent everyone.  The second fault with Electoral College stems from the first issue: people are not voting because they feel as if their voice is not being heard. Stated as a counterargument in paragraph 23 of source three, the article states, "It can be argued that the Electoral College method...may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California." People are choosing not to vote because they feel as if their voice is being shadowed by the major political thinking in their state, and this mindset corrupts the institution of democracy in the United States.  An argument made by those in favor of the Electoral College can found in paragraph 20 of source three, "Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign...They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average and the most thoughtful voters shoule be the ones to decide the election." This argument is opinionated and has no substantial evidence behind it. According to source 2 in paragraph 13, "During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all." This was due to the candidates spending their time, money, and efforts to win over "swing states", the states that could go either Republican or Democrat depending on the candidates that year.  The Electoral College is a system that should not be used anymore because it does not properly consider the opinions of all voters, turns away voters who believe they will not have their voices heard, and leave states without seeing ads or candidates during the election because these candidates are trying to win over other states.		0
 As students progress through middle school, they are presented with a wide range of career options and are encouraged to explore them. It is essential that students have the opportunity to choose their own career path, as it is a crucial aspect of their future success. However, sometimes parents may force their children to pursue a career that they do not have an interest in. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a lack of fulfillment in the long run.  In today's world, teenagers have the right to choose the career that they want to study. High school is a time for students to prepare and learn different skills that will benefit them in their future careers. It is important to note that learning different skills can prepare students for any job or situation they may encounter. For example, problem-solving skills, communication skills, and teamwork are all essential skills that can be applied to various careers.  Guiding students towards their interests and passions from a young age is an acceptable idea. This approach can help students to learn more and more each day, and their mentality will improve as they gain knowledge and experience. It is essential to encourage students to ask questions, seek advice from those with experience in their desired career, and explore different options before making a decision.  It is also important to consider the impact of education on the future of teenagers in different parts of the world. Many teenagers in countries with limited resources may not have the opportunity to attend school, leading to a lack of education and limited job prospects. The United States offers a great education to those who come from countries with limited resources, giving them the opportunity to achieve their dreams and build a better future for themselves and their families.  In conclusion, it is essential that students have the opportunity to choose their own career path. High school is a time for students to prepare and learn different skills that will benefit them in their future careers. Guiding students towards their interests and passions from a young age is an acceptable idea, and it is important to consider the impact of education on the future of teenagers in different parts of the world.		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.  The Electoral College is a system that was created in the 18th century to ensure that small states had a voice in the presidential election. However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary or fair. In fact, it is actually undemocratic.  Under the Electoral College, a candidate can win the presidency even if they lose the popular vote. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. In 2016, Donald Trump won the presidency even though Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.  This is simply unacceptable. The President of the United States should be the candidate who receives the most votes from the American people.  There are many arguments in favor of abolishing the Electoral College. First, it is undemocratic. As I mentioned before, a candidate can win the presidency without winning the popular vote. This is simply unfair to the millions of Americans who voted for the losing candidate.  Second, the Electoral College is not fair to small states. Under the Electoral College, small states have more power than they should. This is because each state has a certain number of electoral votes, regardless of its population. This means that a vote in a small state is worth more than a vote in a large state.  Third, the Electoral College discourages voter turnout. In states that are considered to be "safe" for one party, many voters do not bother to vote. They know that their vote will not make a difference. This is a problem because it means that the President is not being elected by the majority of the American people.  Fourth, the Electoral College is not efficient. It is a complex system that is difficult to understand. This makes it difficult for people to follow the presidential election and to understand the results.  For all of these reasons, I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. The President of the United States should be the candidate who receives the most votes from the American people.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
In today's world, many people have gone against the odds and achieved success. These individuals have shown that with hard work, determination, and perseverance, anything is possible. However, failure is also a common experience in life. It is important to understand the causes of failure and how it can be used as a learning experience and motivator to strive for success.  One of the main causes of failure is a lack of motivation. Without a clear goal or reason to work towards, individuals may lose interest and give up. In order to avoid this, it is important to set high goals and have a strong desire to achieve them. This will help keep individuals motivated and focused on their end goal.  Another cause of failure is a lack of planning or preparation. Without a solid plan or strategy in place, individuals may not be able to effectively reach their goals. In order to avoid this, it is important to do research, create a plan, and take action. This will help individuals stay on track and make progress towards their goals.  In addition to these causes, failure can also be a learning experience. By learning from our mistakes, we can gain valuable insights and knowledge that can help us improve and grow. It is important to embrace failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than as a setback.  Ultimately, aiming high and working to achieve one's goals is the best course of action in order to maximize success. By setting high goals and working hard to achieve them, individuals can overcome obstacles and achieve great things. It may not always be easy, but the rewards are worth it.  In conclusion, there are many examples of people who have gone against the odds and achieved success. Failure is a common experience in life, but it can be used as a learning experience and motivator to strive for success. It is important to set high goals, have a strong desire to achieve them, and do research and planning to effectively reach them. By aiming high, individuals can maximize their success and achieve great things.		1
While distance learning offers greater flexibility for students, attending classes in person provides important benefits that better support learning and development.   There are clear advantages to distance learning options. Allowing students to participate from home can help those with health issues, transportation difficulties, or family obligations. It also gives students more control over their schedules. However, the virtual classroom environment is limited in key ways.   Social interaction is reduced without in-person classes. Part of education involves socialization, collaboration with peers, and hands-on group work. The classroom setting fosters an environment where students learn important social and emotional skills through daily interactions. It also lets them form important relationships with teachers and fellow students. Distance learning makes real-time cooperation and bonding much more difficult.  Engagement and accountability tend to be lower for distance options. It can be challenging for teachers to keep students focused and participating when they learn from home, where distractions are plentiful. The physical classroom creates structure and a dedicated learning space, making it easier for teachers to assess understanding and ensure students are on track. Some students also rely on the external motivation of attending school each day.   Hands-on learning suffers without real laboratories, workshops, and other facilities. Not all subjects can be taught effectively through online videos alone. Science, technology, arts and vocational classes especially benefit from access to specialized equipment and materials. This may not be feasible for students to replicate at home.   Overall, while distance learning provides valuable flexibility, attending classes in person better supports learning objectives for many students. A blended model that incorporates both online and face-to-face elements may be ideal, allowing students to benefit from the structure of school while also gaining independent learning skills. But regular physical attendance remains important for maximizing social, emotional and academic development.		1
I think driverless cars are a great idea. If you are a business man and you're busy and you need to get things ready on your way to work driverless cars could help you out, but you still need to pay attention to the road because the driverless cars need to be controlled under certain circumstances.  Although their name is a driverless vehicle a driver still needs to operate it when needed such as when there is consruction or if there is a wreck in the middle of the road so the driver needs to pay attention even if he doesn't need to drive. The car will notify the driver if the road ahead requires human skills by either telling the driver or flashing lights on the dashboard.  Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passangers, and pedestians safe. Some states think the smart car may abstruct those laws such as California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. These states won't even allow computerdriven cars be tested. I think the idea of a driverless car is great but as you can see some other people don't.		0
Cars are useful tools for getting around, but can they harm the environment? Foreign countries in Europe and in South America have started to have major cutbacks on cars. They are trying to limit the amount of smog they have in the cities. Places like Germany, Colombia, and France as well as the United States of America have started to decrease the amount of driving. People in small towns like in Europe should not really need cars, because everything is within walking distance. However, cities in America, definetly need cars to get around. America was built off of cars and long distance transportation. That's why there are tons of roads and highways and large towns and cities. It's ok for smaller towns to cutback on their car usage. Cars can have a negative affect on the environment and limiting car usage is a good way to cut back on environmental endangerment.  Limiting car usage is a good way to save the environment. In Vauban, Germany, the people are already going "car-free". 70% of the town's population do not own cars. David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America says "'All of our development since World War II has been centred on the car, and that will have to change"', "'How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.'" (Source 1). In France, smog from gas emmissions of cars have been abundant. The government limited the amount of people driving by saying the even numbered license plates are not allowed to be on the road that day, and then the odd the next day. Many were fined for non compliance. "Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog... [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world". (Source 2) Diesel fuel was to blame for this because diesels make up about 67% of France. In the capital of Colombia they have A Day Without Cars. Violators faced $25 charges. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states "'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"'(Source 3). Bogota has about 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most in Latin America. Many countries around the world have started to lower  the car usage. America is slowly starting to shift, but it will be a long and treacherous journey to completely rid the world of cars.  Limiting car usage in the world can benefit the environment. It decrease fuel emmissions and can limit smog. It also decreases stress and air pollution. Many countries around the world are starting to limit there car usage. They have started doing things like Days Without Cars. Some have even quit using cars completely. It is easier for people who live in smaller towns and cities to do this, because everything is within walking distance. It will be harder to get America to make this shift, because this nation was built off of cars. Our entire geography is based off of the automobile. In order to limit cars and in turn save the environment, America will need to change severely.    		0
Dear Principal,  I believe that changing the schools cell phone policy so we can have our phones out during lunch and other free periods is a very smart and wise idea. The reason why i believe so strongly in this reason is because students all ready use their phones during class, lunch, hallways, and other areas around the school. But if you instil this change of policy the chances are there would be less students texting or using there phones in class because they all ready have a time in the day to use their phones without getting in trouble. But if you do pass the policy in which we are not aloud to phones in the school building, the chances are that students will still bring them, still play with them, and will still definitely text with them in class. However if you pass the policy where we are aloud to bring them and use them in our free time then there will be a lot less students getting in trouble for texting on their phones. Phones can be distracting but they aren't going to go away and with time they are going to become more and more popular. So i feel it's better to embrace it rather then just to push it away and pretend that, that rectangle in our pocket isn't our phones because i can ensure you that it probably is.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
When peoples ask for advices, they sometimes talks to more than one person. This can helps them makes a betters choise for many reesons.  First, gettings many opinions can helps peoples see diffrent sides of a problem. For example, if someones askes their friends and family members about a big desission, they might gets many diffrent ansers. Some peoples might say yes, some might say no, and some might say maybe. This can helps the person see all the diffrent ways to look at the problem and make a more informed desission.  Another reeson why seeking multiplie opinions can helps is that it can helps peoples avoids biases. If someone only asks one person for advice, they might gets a biased anser. For example, if someone asks their best friend for advice, their friend might say yes just because they want to be supportive. But if they asks many peoples, they might gets a more balanced view and avoids biases.  Finally, seeking multiplie opinions can helps peoples feels more confident in their choise. When peoples talks to many peoples, they can sees that there are many diffrent ways to look at a problem. This can helps them feels more confident that they are making the rite choise.  In conclusion, seeking multiplie opinions can helps peoples makes a betters choise by helping them see diffrent sides of a problem, avoids biases, and feels more confident in their choise. So, next time you have a big desission to make, don't be affraid to talks to many peoples and gets many opinions!		1
Twenty five years ago something very uncommon happened on our planet Mars. NASA sent a shuttle taht can take pictures of anything, NASA sent the shuttle out into space. The shuttle NASA sent out was called "Viking 1". Viking 1 was a shuttle that took (past tence) pictures of plantes. NASA sent the shuttle out to look for possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2. As the shuttle taking pictures it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. The Human face had a enormous head nearly two miles from end to end. Threw the cameras it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Those are some little details about the "Human Face".  Even though i'm a scientist at NASA, some of my friends who were also scientist we all agreed it was probably it was just another Martian mesa, they were common around Cydonia, but this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. I was dissusing the "Face" with someone who thinks it was created by aliens. I was telling him (John) we unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a "huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth." But now that the word got out people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. He was also saying "Its evidence that evidence that NASA would rather hide." Me personally believed the Face was an alien artifact.  And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, so friends Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera which we called (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper than the original Viking photos. We were very anxious to see the picture... the picture revealed ... like we said a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.  Everyone wasn't satisfied. The Face on Mars is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter April '98 which was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camrea on board MGS had to peer though wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.  So then I ordered mission controllers to look again. Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that looks straight down and scans teh planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips.  April 8, 2001 coudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough fro a second look. They had to roll the Space craft 25 degrees to center the Fce in the field of view. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best Viking photo. Meaning in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there we objects in this pictures like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks youll know where they were.  The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms. So they we never alien sights. Even though John never blieved what i said.                     		0
 Should a student's work be praised regardless of its quality? While this idea may seem like a good one in theory, it is a terrible thing to implement in the educational field. As human beings, we all strive for recognition and appreciation for our efforts. However, if we are constantly praised without any constructive criticism, we may become complacent and never improve.  When we receive praise for our work, it gives us a sense of accomplishment and motivates us to continue working hard. However, if we are not given any feedback on how we can improve, we may become stagnant and never reach our full potential. In order to truly improve, we must be willing to accept criticism and use it to better ourselves.  A great example of this is an artist. Artists often receive praise for their work, but it is the criticism that drives them to improve and push themselves to create even better pieces. They may not always agree with the criticism, but they use it as a tool to learn and grow.  In the real world, we will encounter criticism and rejection. If we are not prepared for this, we may struggle to succeed. By receiving constructive criticism in school, students can develop the skills they need to handle criticism and rejection in the future.  In conclusion, while praise is important, it should not be the only thing that students receive. Constructive criticism is just as important, as it helps students identify areas for improvement and reach their full potential.		1
For many years people have been using cars to get around to do their important tasks.  The stress every indivdual has to go through just to make it through the day could be difficult. It is better if we create a car free world. Just picture you waking up in the morning peacefully without the sounds of car motors turning on or the smell of smoke in the air. With the reduction of cars, the planet would be a healthier and safer place to live on.  Limiting car usage can have a numerous amount of advantages to citizens. With all the issues every country has, the most important one is the emisson of green house gases. With the use of less cars, the green house gas percentage rate will go down significantly. In source 3 it says "Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." As this event starts to happen the Earths atmosphere will start to recover and there would be less traffic on the roads. In source 3, Bogota Colombia has a program named the "Day Without Cars." This program has a goal to promote another way of transporation to the people and to reduce smog in their capital city. While it on their third year, "people are generating a revoluntionary change..." said Enrique Riera. Since this event is becoming more sucessfull parks and sports centers have been used more throughout the city. In soruce 2, Pari has a situation of smog too. They decided to created a "partial driving ban" which allowed the air to be cleared in Paris but also fined 4,000 drivers with the cost of 22-euros ($31) or impounded cars for their "reaction of the fine."  Another advantage ciztens have to limiting car usage is that it lowers the cost of indivdual of paying their car bills and the amount of gas which is really high. With other types transportation like public buses, walking or riding a bicycle this effort helps to conserve resources that are about to disappear since we use them too much and it improves our safety with the reduction of having car accidents due to traffic jams. In source 1 Vauban, Germany their is a community that has 5,500 resident that do not own a car. This community restricts car into their streets. This communtiy is a "low-car suburban life" that has a wallkway,stores on the main street and some distant highways with the help of public transportation.  As we continue our effort into establishing a "car free" community it will benefit us in the future. While we reduced the percentage of green house gases in the air then the government will not have to worry about one problem and move to something that needs to be fixed right away. All the taxes we've have beeen paying will to crisis outside of our country. If we expand these no car communties that Colombia and Germany have then there will be a "shift in American behavior" source 4 states. Americans love cars but as the years passed by from "2005-2013 the miles driven per persons have slowly decereased 9 percent." Hopefully,as the next few year it will make a difference.  Even though us humans love cars their is a limit into how much we should use them. But as we grow we will have a healthier and dafer planet to live on, spend less moeny on cars and more money on important nessesites, and it woyukd create a better future for our children an their families.                                                                    		0
The concept of a four-day work week for schools has been gaining popularity in recent years. While some argue that it would bring numerous benefits, others believe that it would have negative consequences. In this essay, I will analyze the pros and cons of a four-day work week for schools.  On the one hand, a four-day work week for schools could have several advantages. Firstly, it could save money and resources. By reducing the number of school days, schools could save on utilities, supplies, and other expenses associated with running a school. Additionally, teachers could potentially save money on transportation and childcare costs.  Secondly, a four-day work week could improve the work-life balance of teachers. Teachers often work long hours and have limited time off. By having an extra day off each week, teachers could have more time to spend with their families, pursue hobbies, and engage in self-care activities.  Thirdly, a four-day work week could improve student attendance and academic performance. Studies have shown that students who attend school fewer days tend to have lower grades and are more likely to drop out. By having more school days, students could have more opportunities to learn and engage in academic activities.  On the other hand, a four-day work week for schools could also have some disadvantages. Firstly, it could be costly to implement. Schools would need to hire additional staff or redistribute resources to cover the reduced workweek. This could be particularly challenging for schools with limited budgets.  Secondly, a four-day work week could disrupt the academic calendar. By having fewer school days, schools would need to condense the curriculum or extend the school year. This could lead to a crowded schedule and reduced opportunities for students to participate in extracurricular activities.  Thirdly, a four-day work week could have negative consequences for students. Some students may struggle to adjust to the new schedule and feel overwhelmed by the increased workload. Additionally, students who attend school fewer days may be at a disadvantage when it comes to college applications and future job opportunities.  In conclusion, a four-day work week for schools has both pros and cons. While it could save money and resources, improve work-life balance, and improve student attendance and academic performance, it could also be costly to implement, disrupt the academic calendar, and have negative		1
"I stayed up all night listening and asking for advice to fullfill my dreams, while you went out and partied, not caring for yours." ~ JeonJungkook. Normally getting more advice from people is a good thing because you can choose from multiple points of view. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, you might not like it but it's true.  Advice comes in many different ways, for an example, Jeon Jungkook, a famous korean singer has made it all the way to where he is now with the advice of his seven group members, he was young when he auditioned maybe 15 or 16. He was in a really bad place at the time, failing highschool, going through finance problems, not being able to talk to people well because he was scared or shy, but he listened to his close friends that hes known for years, and he passed highschool, he's making millions, and he's overcome his fear of talking to people due to many fan meet-and-greets. Someone else who followed advice is Min Yoon - Gi he is one of Jung kooks members, Yoongi was going through really hard times, his parents were having finacial problems and they were mistreating him because he wanted to be a music producer. He was kicked out of his parents house at age 16, he went and moved in with his friend Kim Seok jin, who was also a music producer, Yoongi suffered from depression and anxiety, he spent half of his time asking for Seok jin's advice because he was older and had a lot of experience with these kinds of problems. He listened to all the advice he got from his friends, and now he's in a band with all his friends as his members under a big compony called BigHit Entertainment and he's also a solo artist making millions off of songs and albulms, and he gained his families respect for being sucsessful and fullfilling his dreams even with all the things they put him through.  Reciving advice can come differently for each person, some can be good advice, or some could be bad advice. You can tell good advice from bad advice by seeing how the person is saying it, do they look suspicious, are they being positive and happy, are they making eye contact, are they facing you at all times and relly listening to what you need help with, sadly not all advice will be helpful, this can be caused by going to the wrong people for help or interpreting the advice wrongly. Always go to the people you have known for advice, friends, family other close people. Don't just go to a random person that you've only known for a few months because most likely, they know nothing personal about you, they know nothing about what is going on in your life, and when your sad and need advice they might be there for you but not give you good advice. When you're sad you're really vonurable and will most likely listen to anything someone says is good advice, when in reality it's really not. If you go to the wrong people you are giving them a chance to overpower you because they know if they make the advice seem real enough you will believe it and do it just because they told you to. That's not good advice.  lastly, you can always learn new things from getting advice frome different people. Good advice can lead you in many different places, you could be a singer under a big compony making a lot of money, or you could get a good paying job, some good advice can come from music, I know a few lines that halp me get through my darkest days. Some of them are; "let them be them, let us be us."-BTS "count one, two, three, take my hands now and close your eyes, ill lead you through the dark."  -BTS "you got me, even in your darkest days, I got you, to be the light to shine my path on this dark narrow road." "just one day can we forget about all the fights and pains of the world, just one day."-BTS " all of those lyrics have uplifted me and made me feel positive about myself, they shaped me into the person I am today, and that's all because they put their life problems and all they advice they have to give into music, so people like me who are going through problems can read it and see that they went through the same things, so they can let us see that it gets better in the end and that we dont need to wait for good to come to us because we are good. If you listen to good advice from good people you most likely will always be in a happy positive mood and feel proud of the person you let that advice shape you into. While if you listened to bad advice and stayed with the wrong friend group it could lead you to spending your life behind bars or doing comunity service. You need to make the right chioces and be with the right people and listen to good advice if you want to make it anywhere in life.  To sum it all up, take the advice form people but pick out the good advice and leave the bad advice out, talk to your elders for advice, they've been through what your going through. think about you're friend group and if they're good for you're future. 		0
The process of the electing the president is a topic commonly debated upon. This topic must be carefully examined because the President of the United States plays a major role in leading our country and must be chosen with care. The two ways of electing our president is by the Electoral College which dates back to the founding fathers, or by the popular vote which is a more modern process. The question is, should the electoral college remain the current voting process or should we change to electing the president of the United States through popular votes? Whether you are in favor of the Electoral College or against it there are consequences to both sides. Presidential election through popular votes may have disadvantages, yet the Electoral College must be changed because voters are not in complete control and reduce the probability of an electoral tie.  To begin, according to Richard A. Posner the Electoral College is a fair accurate way to elect the president. The Electoral College requires the candidates to have a multiregional appeal and allows the most thoughtful voters to decide the election unlike the popular vote. Richard A. Posner notes in his article that the Electoral College avoids a candidate that is a regional favorite to gain votes and win. The Electoral College requires the candidates to have a "transregional appeal" Posner. If we used a process that allowed a candidate with only regional appeal to be elected as President this would increase the chances of electing an ineffective, successful president. Additionally, the Electoral College allows only the most thoughtful voters to decide who becomes President Posner. candidates will be chosen more carefully and thoughtfully. These voters will have gained the most accurate information and apply this to their choice. Thus, the Electoral College has some beneficial outcomes, but the popular vote is a better choice for our system of choosing the President.  First of all, changing to electing through popular votes could fix the problem of voters not having a big say in who become the President. In Bradford Plumer's article he includes that voters can't always "control whom their electors vote for". All of the residents of the United States who choose to participate in the presidential election should be able to have their voice heard individually. Voters should not have to rely on their state electors to choose the right president. Additionally, voters not being able to have their voice hears affects which candidate becomes elected. Sometimes the electors can go against the opinion of the people Plumer. Electors should not be the only ones that are allowed to have responsibilty in picking the President of the United States. Electors could totally "defy the will of the people" and it is unfair that they are responsible for the whole process of choosing the President of the United States. Thus, the popular vote is a better choice because the people of the United States should have a bigger say in their President.  Secondly, changing the electoral college to popular vote could not only help voters have their voice heard but, it could also reduce the probability of a tie in the electoral vote.		0
In this day and age a significant amount of technological advances are being created to help people, but a technological advance that would do more harm than help is online classes for students. People may argue that online classes will give students more time to complete assignments, but it will develop bad habits such as poor time management and procrastination. Students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it provides easier access to cheat, make it difficult to learn, and if the internet is down students can't do their assignments.  Online classes will give students easy access to cheat on assignments, quizzes, and tests. When a student cheats it shows that they do not understand the material given. To put things into perspective, if I were to cheat on an exam, I would only do so if I did not understand the material. By allowing students to take online classes will increase the amount of cheating tremendously. All in all, students cannot gain anything from cheating.  Students taking online classes will come to the realization quickly that it is much more difficult to learn. For example, if the student does not understand the content he or she can't ask a question to the teacher immediately. This may cause the student to get frustrated and give up. It takes an immense amount of dedication to be able to succeed when taking online classes. Ultimately, students may struggle with learning the material when taking an online course.  Online classes cannot be accessed without internet. This becomes a problem because if the student does not have internet they cannot learn the material and they will not be able to complete their work. Also another problem with this is that many students may not know how to resolve their internet issues to allow them to do their work. This all could have been easily avoided if the class was taken in person rather than online.  In conclusion, there are many issues that are surrounded with taking online classes such as providing easier access to cheat, more difficult to learn the material, and if the internet is not working students cannot complete their assignments. These issues just stated can be avoided by taking classes in person as it will make the learning process less complicated.        		0
 Venus, also known as the Earth's sister planet, is the second planet from the sun. It is the closest planet to Earth and is often referred to as Earth's twin planet. However, despite its proximity, a lot remains unknown about Venus due to its hostile atmosphere, which is full of sulfuric acid and extreme temperatures. In this essay, we will explore some of the latest discoveries about Venus and what we can learn from them.  One of the most interesting recent discoveries about Venus is that there may be liquid water underneath its surface. According to a study published in Science in 2017, there is evidence of a subglacial ocean on Venus that is as deep as the deepest part of the Pacific Ocean. This discovery raises the possibility that Venus may have had the conditions necessary to support life in the past.  Another recent discovery about Venus is that it has a thick atmosphere that is full of clouds. In fact, there are massive cloud formations on Venus that are so dense that they block out the sun and create an eerie twilight effect on the surface. Scientists have also discovered that the clouds on Venus are made of sulfuric acid, which is incredibly corrosive and harmful to life.  In addition to its hostile atmosphere, Venus is also known for its extreme temperatures. The surface of Venus can reach temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, while the temperature at the cloud tops can reach minus 460 degrees Fahrenheit. These extreme temperatures are believed to be due to the planet's greenhouse effect, which traps heat in the atmosphere and causes temperatures to rise.  Despite these challenges, scientists are still working hard to learn more about Venus. The European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft has been orbiting the planet since 2005 and is producing valuable data about its atmosphere and surface. Meanwhile, NASA's Magellan spacecraft orbited Venus from 1990 to 1997 and provided some of the best-ever images of the planet's surface.  In conclusion, Venus is still a mystery to us, but recent discoveries have given us a glimpse into what the planet might be like. The possibility of liquid water underneath its surface and massive cloud formations made of corrosive sulfuric acid raises the possibility that Venus may have had the conditions necessary to support life in the past. While we may never be able to visit Venus in person, the work of future space missions and scientific research will continue to unravel its secrets and give us a better understanding of our sister planet.		1
Phones & Driving  I feel like drivers should not be able to use cellular devices in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I strongly feel this way because it's very dangerous. Texting and driving has been the main cause for most car accidents. Car accidents that can potentially lead to death or a serious injury. Not only are people putting their life at risk, but they're putting others life at risk as well. Texting can wait and should never be done while driving.  Operating a cellular device while driving a vehicle is dangerous in many ways. When your vehicle is traveling at 35 mph that means you are moving at 16 meters per second. So, in those few moments your eyes were on your cellular device instead of the road. This means you have moved far enough to not see a school bus, a kid playing, or a vehicle braking in front of you. Just reaching for your phone could be deadly as well.  Texting and driving has caused 1.6 million crashes a year. 390,000 injuries also occur each year due to texting and driving. Also 1 out every 4 car crashes occur due to texting and driving. Responding to a text while driving can distract a driver for around 5 seconds. At 50 mph this is enough time to travel the distance of a football field.  Honestly, I've seen so many people texting while driving while I was a passenger.  I didn't feel safe at all. It's almost like feeling like I'm in the car with a drunk driver. Seeing people drive reckless makes me wonder what's going to happen. I think that driving while texting should be banned completely.  So basically, cellular devices and cars are like oil and water. They don't mix well at all. If you take cellular device use while in cars out of the picture, this will benefit the world in many ways. There will be less car crashes, injuries, and deaths caused by distractions. Its simple cellular devices should not be used while operating a vehicle for any reason unless there is a life or death emergency. Taking them away from those operating cars or even bikes could save lives.             		0
Summer Projects  I believe schools should require students to complete projects during summer break. Most students do nothing during break, so they spend their time without learning anything new. It will help students be well educated while on break. The students would be motivated to do a summer break project if it was designed by them, the students. Doing schools projects during break will give students new knowledge, they will be educated once returning to school, and having the project be student-designed would motivate them.  Most students do nothing during break, so they spend their time without learning anything. Many students are not able to travel during summer break due to money or health problems, which is why they don't look forward to summer break. If a project is assigned, the student will work on it without hesitation. Working on an important project during break will encourage students to keep learning in school and out of school. Having a project designed by a student encourages other students to do it.  The students would be motivated to do a summer break project if it was designed by them, the students. Of course they would come up with the idea, then share it with a teacher, whom would decide if it's an idea that would benefit the students. The teacher would help the student by creating some requirements for the project. The idea is to create a poster about the subject the students likes best, and it should include information about the class and why it is a class to take. That will help with how well the student knows the knowledge of the class. It gives them a great experience and they get educated on their own.  It will help students be well educated while on break. For the most part students do not like learning any new material, which they consider to be hard. On the contrary, learning from home gives them comfort, and they work hard to accomplish the task assigned. Designed by students, the project is an activity they can enjoy. They wouldn't make it impossible to create, so that the students don't try. It is a project where they can expand their knowledge and be as creative as possible.  In conclusion, having students design a project for summer break is a great idea. It not only gives students, who don't get to enjoy a break, something to work on. It helps provide them with more information than usual which will help them be better in school, yet it also helps students be creative. Doing schools projects during break will give students new knowledge, they will be educated once returning to school, and having the project be student-designed would motivate them.		0
The limiting of usage a car has to stop because it destroy our country. How can cars destroy our country? Car can destroy our green house in many ways. one way if with all the components that the car have. For example, it can be destroy with the steam that the car throw out in the air(gas).Sometimes people can have  stress by having a car because they have to payed a lot, if a car doest'n work. They had to send the car to a place that can be fixed  and it can expand a lot of your money.  To begin with,sometimes car can be good for people that have there job far away of their home. But also car can cause you to have stress. for example in the source 3:car-free day is spinningn into  a big hit Bogota said that "its a good opportunity to take away stress and lolwer air pollution". This is true because if we not using a car, we don't have to worry to pay taxed, or to fixed the car. In my opinion if we just start to using car all the time, this is going to cause a big problem. Why cars can cause you a big problem on your daily life? Because cars can stop you to walk,can stop you to do a lot of things. You can get sick, one problem that United States has is the fat people. Why fat people? because they just start to use car and they doesn' t realize that if you use a lot the car, you forget that you have to do exersise or to walk. Well, is not just the car that can cause you to be fat, there are other stuff that can cause you to be fat. In the sources 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, said that "that few  soccer moms or communiting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars". They notice that cars can causing a lot of problems by paying a lot. Some people had to decide to gave up their car by walking to their jobs, or going to buy some food or just want to walk to be healthy.  Cars can be a limited for some people. If we just be a liltle thinker sometimes, we can notice that us, "THE HUMAN" we are destroyed our world with all the substances that the car hurl in the air. This world was make to protect us, but we just like to destroy the nature by the chemical that the car has, and other stuff that cause the world to be destroy. If you are an intelligent person you can stop this by don't having a car, and use your feet to get whatever you want to go.    		0
i think this should be a thing because it would help people work when on a computer. it would help people becasue it would make them more enjoyable for the person that is working. it would help because if th user is not satisified by the way a lession is performing the computer would know that an change the application to make it more interesting to the spicific user. also it would be diffrent for everybody and everyone has a diffrent way of learning certain things. doing this would make studfence preform better because th appilication that they are using conforms to them specifically. the only bad thing about this is that some people would say that it is invading peoples thoughts and that it should not be able to know everything down to emotions in a person. the othe rthing wrong with this is that we dont have the capeability to have that in the common computers that we have today , simply because they would have to be way bigger just to have the space to hold all the facial recognition codes for every emotion. those are the reasons i think that facial recognition in a school computer would be helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                       		0
Graduating high school in three or four years is a topic that has been debated for many years. While some people argue that graduating in three years is better because it allows for more free time and opportunities for life activities, others argue that graduating in four years provides a higher quality of education and more opportunities for elective courses. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of graduating high school in three or four years and argue in favor of graduating in four years.  Graduating in three years allows for more free time and opportunities for life activities. Many people argue that high school is just a stepping stone to adulthood, and that students should be able to enjoy their youth while they can. Graduating in three years would allow students to take more time off from school to travel, pursue hobbies, and spend time with family and friends. Additionally, graduating in three years would allow students to start college or enter the workforce sooner, which could lead to more job opportunities and higher salaries in the long run.  However, graduating in three years could also have negative consequences. First, students may not be fully prepared for the rigors of college or the workforce. Many colleges and employers require a certain level of knowledge and skills that may not be acquired in three years. Additionally, graduating in three years may limit the number of elective courses that students can take, which could limit their opportunities for personal growth and exploration.  On the other hand, graduating in four years provides a higher quality of education and more opportunities for elective courses. Graduating in four years allows students to take more elective courses, which can lead to a more well-rounded education. Additionally, graduating in four years provides more time for students to prepare for college or the workforce. This extra time can help students develop the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in their chosen field.  Furthermore, graduating in four years can also lead to more job opportunities and higher salaries in the long run. Many employers prefer candidates who have completed a four-year degree, as it shows a higher level of dedication and commitment to their education. Additionally, graduating in four years can lead to more job opportunities and higher salaries in the long run, as it can help students stand out in a competitive job market.  In conclusion, graduating high school in		1
 The concept of car-free cities has gained significant attention in recent years as a solution to various urban problems such as traffic congestion, pollution, and obesity. Car-free cities are urban areas where private vehicles, including cars and motorbikes, are prohibited or restricted in certain parts of the city. This essay will explore the benefits of car-free cities and discuss their potential challenges when implementing them.  One of the most significant benefits of car-free cities is the improvement of air quality. Private vehicles emit greenhouse gases and air pollutants that contribute to climate change and respiratory illnesses. By restricting or prohibiting private vehicles, car-free cities can significantly reduce emissions, leading to improved air quality.  Another benefit of car-free cities is the reduction of traffic congestion. Car-free cities encourage the use of public transportation, cycling, and walking, which leads to less traffic congestion on the roads. This can result in shorter commute times and increased productivity.  Moreover, car-free cities promote physical activity, which can lead to a reduction in obesity rates. By banning private vehicles, people are forced to walk, bike, or take public transportation, which encourages physical movement and exercise.  Despite the benefits of car-free cities, there are potential challenges when implementing them. One of the main challenges is the lack of public transportation and infrastructure. Car-free cities rely heavily on public transportation to provide an alternative to private vehicles. If there is inadequate public transportation or infrastructure, people may find it difficult to get around the city, leading to increased frustration and resistance to the policy.  Another challenge is the cost of implementing car-free cities. Restricting or prohibiting private vehicles requires significant investment in infrastructure and public transportation. This can be expensive and might not be feasible for all cities.  Finally, car-free cities often face opposition from stakeholders who rely on private vehicles for their livelihoods. For example, taxi drivers, car rental companies, and trucking companies may be negatively impacted by car-free policies.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer several benefits, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and increased physical activity. However, there are potential challenges when implementing them, including the lack of public transportation and infrastructure, cost, and opposition from stakeholders. Nevertheless, if implemented effectively, car-free cities can be an effective solution to urban problems and a more sustainable future.		1
 As a high school student, it is important to identify a career path that aligns with your interests and goals. While some may argue that it is too early to make such a decision, it is actually beneficial for students to start exploring their options early on. By identifying a career, students can improve their knowledge, learn new skills, and make informed decisions about their future.  One of the main benefits of identifying a career is that it can improve a student's knowledge. As they progress through high school, students will encounter a variety of subjects and opportunities that can help them develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their chosen field. By identifying a career early on, students can focus their efforts on the subjects and activities that will be most beneficial to their future goals.  In addition to improving their knowledge, students can also learn new skills through their chosen career path. High school is a great time to explore new interests and hobbies, and many students take advantage of this by learning new skills such as playing an instrument, playing a sport, or even learning how to cook. These skills can not only be fun and fulfilling, but they can also be valuable in the workplace.  Furthermore, identifying a career can also help students make informed decisions about their future. High school is a time of transition, and students are faced with many important decisions about their education and future. By identifying a career early on, students can gain a better understanding of what they want to do and can make more informed decisions about their classes, extracurricular activities, and even their college or post-secondary education.  Of course, identifying a career is not always easy, and it is important for students to be open to exploring different options. High school is a time of self-discovery, and students may find that their interests and goals change as they learn more about themselves and the world around them. It is important for students to be flexible and open to new opportunities, and to be willing to make changes if they find that their chosen career path is not the right fit for them.  In conclusion, identifying a career early on can be a valuable tool for high school students. By focusing their efforts on the subjects and activities that will be most beneficial to their future goals, students can improve their knowledge, learn new skills, and make informed decisions about their future. While it is important for students to be open to exploring different options,		1
Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,  I am writing you in concern of the new policy which you have been considering with the school board. In case you have forgotten, and I mean so in the utmost respect, it is just that people have a tendency to forget things, the new policy which has been suggested is to change school policy so that students are not allowed to participate in sports or other activities unless they have a B grade average. In my opinion, this change is immensely unfair to the student body, will cause disarray among the different clubs, and will hurt the school much more than it will aid the school. My understanding is that you are considering this policy change so that students will work harder to retain a B average and so the student body will improve, however, you must also consider the numerous possible negative consequences.  First however, I believe some background knowledge is required. As you know already, a C grade average is considered average in most of our country, where as a B or an A average are considered above average, and outstanding, respectively. Also, as you may know already, most of the student body retains a C average. Your change in school policy would mean that everybody who is currently participating in school activities would be kicked out of them until new term grades come in at which point they may only hope that they did well enough to continue their sport. Our competitive would all fail do to the almost complete rooting of the students. Now this may only last a term, but who knows how long it might take to raise your grade average by a whole letter? You obviously went to school when you were a child, and I assume you enjoyed the extra curricular clubs which your school had to offer. Now imagine this. Imagine that you learned that you had to maintain an A or B average to continue in these sports. Now this was one of the years where you didn't do so well, and therefore got a C average. Wouldn't such a thing be detrimental to you? It would cause you to be kicked out of every activity which you participated in unless you managed to raise your grade! That is one the main points I am putting forth. Such a change is not fair to the student body because the student body usually only maintains a C average!  Another negative consequence which may have been overlooked is the fact that people's grades are not always constant. A student may get straight As one term but in the next term may get straight Cs. That would mean the activities would have an inconsistent flow of students for every term. The students who had improved their average would join their respective clubs but the students who had not would be forced to withdraw from their activities. The sports teams would fail because every player they got with the new term would not be as practised as the ones which they had from the old term. And what if their all-star line-up could not retain the necessary grade point average? Then victory for our sports teams would almost be impossible. I do not doubt the skills of the students within our school, but skill given and skill learned are to different things to consider. A person who is not great at basketball but who goes to every practice and tries as hard as he can at home might as well match a natural-born super star at basketball who doesn't practice due to arrogance. Which also brings me back to how such a change would be unfair.  A person who might spend a huge amount of time practicing their sport but who was not the best academic wise would find themselves in an incredibly bad spot. They would not be allowed to participate in the sport which they loved until they academically improved. And this change might cause them to much stress to be able to improve.  The change which you are suggesting might even prove to be an unhealthy change to the student body to the amount of anxiety which it causes. Students would easily find themselves in depression when they are unable to retain the correct grade average and such a thing would never be good for a school. Also people would have to deal with the stress of knowing that if they do not do well enough in school, they will not be able to participate in the things which they love. Such a thing is almost the same as bribing students to do well in school. Because they do well enough they're allowed to play a sport or join a club but if they don't they cannot do anything extra-curricular.  Also, this would thoroughly disorganise after-school help due to the fact that after-school help falls under the category an "other activity." Students who needed help would not be able to get it through conventional methods within school. And what about the special education children or the less intelligent students who struggle just to pass? What about the people who can only get a C if they try their hardest? They would find themselves isolated, neither able to do well in school, nor able to do well in sports or other activities because they wouldn't be allowed to participate in them. Though I may be talking extremes, such a thing would be likely to increase the possibility that one of those misfortunate students would commit suicide! And a life is a life no matter how that person does in academics.  Certainly you cannot think that such a change would be a good thing for the school! All it would bring is chaos and stress and the amount of people who improve would also find themselves always under pressure, always struggling to be above average. There are various things that could go wrong under such a monumental change. It would certainly be unfair to the students, the activities would be very disorganized (some of them might even be forced to close due to lack of participants), and it would be unhealthy for all your students.  Please consider the statements which I have written above, and I hope they may influence a change of mind. Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
Title: Exploring Generic_City, Italy: Culture, Luxury Cars, and Canal Tours  Hey there, folks! Today, I'm super excited to share my findings about Generic_City, Italy. I've always been fascinated by the culture, food, and lifestyle of this beautiful country, and I'm glad I got the chance to dig deeper. From language to luxury cars, canal tours, and even the similarities between Italian and Spanish language, I've got you covered! 😃  First off, let's talk about the culture of Generic_City. It's like, wow! The people are so friendly and welcoming, and the language is just amazing. I mean, have you heard how they pronounce their words? It's like music to my ears! 🎶 I learned that the official language of Generic_City is Italian, and it's so different from Spanish. Like, did you know that Italian has a lot of vowels and diphthongs, while Spanish has a lot of consonants? It's pretty cool how they're both Romance languages, but they have their own unique twist. 🤔  Moving on to the luxury cars, oh boy! Have you heard of Ferrari, Lamborghini, and Alpha Romero? 😍 These cars are like works of art, and they're all from Generic_City! I read that Ferrari is known for its sleek designs and powerful engines, while Lamborghini is all about bold and aggressive styling. And let me tell you, Alpha Romero is like the ultimate luxury car  ?it's got everything! 💥 From heated seats to massaging steering wheels, these cars are the epitome of luxury. I mean, can you imagine cruising around Generic_City in one of these babies? 😍  Now, let's talk about canal tours and boat rentals. Have you ever been on a gondola ride in Venice? 🚣‍♀ ?It's like, totally romantic and stuff! I learned that Generic_City has a		1
Dear principal  I don't like the idea of when joining sports you need a average of a B grade ..... Most students in school have a C average, that means that us students would NOT be able to compete in the athletics clubs of the school ..... I mainly disagree because that means hardly anybody would be joining in football, volleyball, flag football, basketball, track and field.... and without anybody participating there would be no games against other school and NO school spirit... Mostly everyone in this school wants to do a sport for extra curricular for school. Without kids doing sports what's the whole point on having sports teams if they cant play in it. I believe that the average grade for playing sports should be a C....  I'm getting a C .... and if im getting a C i cant play my favorite sport volleyball, I LOVE VOLLEYBALL and its going to suck if i cant even join or participate in playing the sport .. and if you take this opportunity from us not playing sports unless we have a B average, NOBODY will be participating because we did not meet the standards of playing sports ....  I believe that if you changed the average grade for playing sports you will see changes in grades because the students in our school  WANTS to play sports for school.... I actually took a survey on how much people would try their best on their grades to play sports in school , and 95% of the students of our school said they would try their best to get a C average for sports.... & I BELIEVE in my fellow students and i know they would not let me down if it helps them get to something they really want to do in school ....  All im asking is a little support in trying to switch from getting a B average to getting a C average to be able to play sports.... and i promise you the school report cards will not be disappointing ...... because i know if i wanted to play volleyball really badly id do anything in my power of doing good on my grades... and that's what i will be doing for this quarter shooting for my goal in playing a sport by getting a C average grade if you change it .... Please and thank you for taking sometime out of your busy schedule and reading my letter for asking if you'd please change the average grade for sports from being a B to being a C .  One of your fellow students from the 8th grade,  STUDENT_NAME		0
well i will argue against it because i bet some of the teachers and Cs when they went to middle school and how they still got to participate in sports and how C is average and that some teachers where at Cs but now she want to change that to be so now the school will lose more money because there's probably more C sport players then threes A and B grade sport players and what u pay like 300 dollars just to join the football team and it's not fair to the lower grade but there really good at sports and some people with Bs aren't so good at sports so then there's going to be kids that aren't the brightest at school but they would not be treating them equal to the kids with Bs and As. and then the kids for example when they play football which was like every day they stayed after they parents would get home before they did so that way the kids don't have to stay home alone. and when there's kids that are Bs and As they may not be as built for there position and the Cs people are so then the team wouldn't be as good and then it a smart A or B student get hammered really hard in football he could get like head trauma and brain damage so then his grades would suffer because of it and i bet the school loves the trophies that are in the class case out there in the hall what and if you look at the pictures and you look at the teams there kids that have all different grades not just A and B grades and i bet with all the C and below students there wouldn't be as many trophies winning in the coming years because the 7th grade foot ball team last year hade C students and look they won district champs. but then again it they do beside to put that policy in affect students who love sports will maybe try to get there grade up so they can play or they wont and just let it drop because they cant play and some times that's all kids do is just play sports and there about to take it away. which they should not do because it's not fair to all students.		0
 The use of facial recognition technology like the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms could potentially have both benefits and drawbacks when it comes to reading students' emotional expressions.   On one hand, this technology may help teachers gain insights into how their students are feeling during lessons. If a teacher can see that many students appear bored or frustrated while learning a new concept, it could prompt the teacher to adjust their approach to re-engage the class. Identifying students who seem upset or anxious may also help teachers provide support earlier. The technology may shine a light on non-verbal cues that a teacher could miss by only interacting with a few students at a time.  However, there are also valid concerns about this type of technology in schools. Continually monitoring students' facial expressions could invade their privacy and make some feel uncomfortable knowing they are being watched and analyzed. Students should feel free to naturally express a range of emotions like confusion or irritation during learning without fearing the teacher may misinterpret these as bad behaviors. There is also a risk the technology may not always accurately read students' emotions or account for cultural differences in expression. This could lead to teachers making incorrect assumptions about how students are feeling.   Overall, while the technology offers potential to give teachers insights that could aid learning, more research would need to be done to address privacy and accuracy issues before wide adoption is appropriate or ethical. A balanced approach where the technology is only used occasionally rather than constant surveillance may help maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks. Students and parents should also have a say in how such tools are utilized. With proper safeguards and consensus, emotional tracking technology could be a valuable new tool. But unchecked use in classrooms could ultimately do more harm than good.		1
School can be very stressful at times and it can be hard to not worry about your grades, or other school related issues. So having something to do other then school work would be very beneficial to students. There for, I agree that making extracurricular activities required would be good because it will give students a chance to meet new people, focus on something other than school work and it will keep students out of any trouble that they might have out of school.  Having extracurricular activities required for students would be very helpful because it would give students a chance to meet new people. One extracurricular activity I do is dance, and I can for sure say that I have made some of the best friendships because of it. One really important friendship that I have made is with my friend Generic_Name. She is a year older than me and has been dancing a lot longer, so I can look up to her. I am very thankful that I do dance because I would not have been able to meet one of my best friends. So I agree that doing an extracurricular activity should be required because it would give students a chance to meet new people and make new friends.  Being involved in an extracurricular activity can be good because it will allow students to focus on something other then school work. As a honors student I am required to work very hard in and out of school and it can be very stressful at times. I am required to do homework every night and study for extended periods of time. However, I always look forward to going to dance because it allows me to take a break from all my school work and focus on something I really enjoy doing. It also allows me to relax because when I am done with dance I will be able to go back to my work with a more relaxed mindset. I think that having an extracurricular activity required would be very beneficial because it allows students to take a break and focus on something other then school work.  Having to be in an extracurricular activity would make a good impact on students because it would keep them out of any trouble they would have out of school. I have seen many articles and stories where kids have had a bad background and have gotten into trouble in the past, but then they join an activity and it completely changes who they are as a person. They start to get better grades and start to care more about the people around them and in their community. I think that having students join a activity in or out of school could possibly change their life in a very positive way. There for, I agree that making an extracurricular activity required would be very beneficial because it could keep kids out of any trouble they might get into.  In conclusion, being in an extracurricular activity for me has made a very good impact on my life and as changed my life in a very positive way. It also gives other students something more to do then school work because at times school can be very stressful. So I agree that making extracurricular activities required would be good because it will give students a chance to meet new people, focus on something other than school work and it will keep students out of any trouble that they might have out of school.  		0
Proving The Face is Just a Natural Landform.  Although this face was unexpected,that doesn't nessasarily define that the face has anything to do with aliens. There are majority of theories we can assume from this topic. Few scientist condoned that this mysterious face had something to do with a very unordinary prediction .Some scientist seemed surprised when they saw the photograph of the face on mars.  As a scientist, many mistakes are made during observations, but that's apart of human life. Mistakes are casual in everyday life and, all of us make them. In my opinion, I don't think this entertaining outbreak had anything to do with aliens. In fact, they're wasn't a specific sign, or clue that an alien was actually was involved. NASA got a great shot at the face, and the picture closely showed that their was nothing do be deeply concerned about.  The face was defineitly rare, but over the years the face continues to fade so it shouldn't be harmful. If it happened to really be an alien, we would know from the recordings, and pictures that were captured. This is a huge topic to discuss, and space can likely be considered as a horrifying setting due to rumors, and scientific observations. Astrounaunts never discovered any issues, or new assumptions by traveling to space.  The main point is aliens aren't realistic, you may see them in movies, books, or perhaps may hear about them. An alien was never discovered by NASA, and the face just appeared to be a natural cause. The face could of been anything, but we know it wasn't an alien because there is no proof that the face was an alien, and still isn't as we speak.  In conclusion, think about other things that are possible.                                                                                 		0
I know this Face is just a natural landform because, in passage 5, its says, "some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide". This shows that people are going against what scientist are saying and that people have opinons that this is just a natural landform, and that this was naturally formed on Mars.  Also, people have taken pictures of this landform with a camera that is ten times sharper than the Viking photos, stated in passage 7. After they took these pictures with this high tech camera it showed there was no alien monument. When this landform was made and the first photo was shown it formed a humans face, it didn't form an alien. In passage 3 it says, "illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth" of a human being.  If a alien were to make this landform they would probably make it of them, something that actually looks like them not some other creature, like a human. "When the camera was located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 it was cloudy on the Red Planet". While they were searching they never seen Alien markings.  So therfore, the clouds being so cloudy the alien markings where shown as never visible because, they were covered if there was any alien markings but, the camera shows there is no alien markings and that this is a natural landform. Some people have there opinons on if this was reall made by an alien but very few scientist believe this was made by an alien although some do. This is why I say that this is a natural landform and is not made by any type of alien in any form and that this landforn looks naturally made on Mars. 		0
Dear Senator,  I am not alone when I say that I'm not in favor of keeping the Electoral College. According to the Gallup poll taken in 2000, over 60% of voters prefer a direct election, but Congress does nothing to change that. Keeping the Electoral college is unfair to the people of the United States. We should not keep the Elctoral College because, when Americans are voting, they are not voting for their president but for a slate of electors; the legislature is responsible for picking our electors not the people; and the process of a tie in the Electoral College is too unfair to the people.  When Americans are voting for a new president, they want their opinion to count. The popular vote explains what the people wanted for president, but that's not what the people are voting for. When we are voting for president, we are instead voting for a slate of electors; they in turn vote for the president. Voters can't control who the electors vote for, and this gives the a small say in voting for the president.  In the 2000 presidential race Al Gore received more individual votes thjan George W. Bush, but Bush won the election due the amont of elctoral votes over powering the popular votes. This completely goes against what the people want. The state legislatures are responsible for picking our slate electors; these electors have the right to defy the will of the people. Electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please.  During a presidential election, one of the most worrying things to receive from an electoral vote is a tie. When there is a tie, the election is sent to the House of Representatives. Due to the fact that many voters vote one party for the president and another for Congress, the House's selection will barely reflect the will of the people. Their votes can be the complete opposites of the people's vote. You could help us bring an end to the Electoral College.  Sincerely,  PROPER_NAME                                                                            		0
 The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a highly precise and detailed method for analyzing and categorizing facial expressions. Developed by researchers Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in 1978, FACS has become widely used in fields such as psychology, neurology, and even advertising. In this essay, we'll dive into the intricacies of the facial action coding system, exploring its components, uses, and limitations.  The FACS system is based on the idea that facial expressions are composed of a series of discrete actions, which are then combined to create more complex expressions. These actions can be divided into six broad categories: eye movements, eye blinks, head movements, lip movements, jaw movements, and body movements. Within each category, there are numerous subcategories and specific actions that can be identified and measured.  One of the key benefits of FACS is its ability to provide a standardized and objective way of analyzing facial expressions. This is particularly important in fields such as psychology and neuroscience, where researchers need to be able to compare facial expressions across different individuals and conditions. By using a standardized system like FACS, they can ensure that their findings are reliable and valid.  Another important use of FACS is in the field of advertising and marketing. Companies use FACS to analyze consumer reactions to their advertisements, in order to better understand what is resonating with their target audience. For example, FACS can be used to analyze the facial expressions of people watching a television commercial, in order to determine whether they are engaged or disengaged by the content.  Despite its many benefits, FACS does have some limitations. One of the major challenges is the fact that facial expressions can be highly context-dependent. For example, a smile may convey happiness in one situation, but it may also be used to deceive or mask other emotions. This contextual complexity can make it difficult to accurately interpret facial expressions using FACS.  Another limitation of FACS is the fact that it requires specialized training and expertise to use effectively. While the system is based on a standardized set of categories and actions, interpreting these expressions can require a great deal of skill and knowledge. As a result, FACS is not always accessible to researchers and organizations without the necessary expertise.  In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is a highly precise and detailed method for analyzing and categorizing facial expressions. It has many important uses in fields such as psychology, neurology, and advertising, but also has some limitations. Despite these limitations, FACS remains an important tool for researchers and organizations looking to better understand human behavior and emotions.		1
 I believe that honesty is a valuable trait that can help build trust and credibility with others. Being honest allows people to rely on you and believe in your intentions, which can lead to stronger relationships and a sense of respect. Additionally, honesty can help you avoid situations where you may have to lie or deceive others, which can be stressful and potentially damaging to your reputation.  However, there are also times when being honest can be difficult or even harmful. For example, if someone is sensitive or easily offended, being honest may hurt their feelings and cause them to feel upset or angry. In these cases, it may be better to be tactful and considerate in your communication, rather than being blunt and direct.  Ultimately, whether or not to be honest depends on the specific situation and the potential consequences of your actions. If being honest will lead to a positive outcome and strengthen relationships, then it is generally the best course of action. However, if being honest could cause harm or negatively impact someone's feelings, then it may be better to approach the situation with sensitivity and compassion.  In conclusion, while honesty is generally a positive trait, it is important to consider the specific circumstances and potential consequences of being honest or not. By being thoughtful and considerate in our communication, we can build strong and positive relationships with others.		1
Title: The Negative Consequences of Career Identification in High School and the Importance of Nontraditional Paths  Introduction  In today's rapidly changing world, the pressure to identify a career path by the time one enters high school is becoming increasingly common. While some may argue that this approach can provide clarity and direction, I believe that it can have negative consequences on a student's personal and professional growth. In this essay, I will explore the negative consequences of requiring students to identify a career by the time they enter high school and provide examples of individuals who have achieved success by taking nontraditional paths after high school.  The Negative Consequences of Career Identification in High School  The pressure to identify a career path by the time one enters high school can lead to a narrow focus on a specific field, limiting a student's opportunities for exploration and personal growth. Students may feel pressured to choose a career based on their parents' or peers' expectations, rather than their own interests and passions. This can lead to a lack of fulfillment and satisfaction in their chosen career, as they may not have truly explored all of their options.  Moreover, the pressure to identify a career path can lead to a lack of flexibility in a student's education and career trajectory. Students may feel that they must take specific courses or pursue certain extracurricular activities in order to achieve their desired career, even if those activities do not align with their true interests or passions. This can lead to a rigid and inflexible approach to education, which can hinder a student's ability to adapt to changes in the job market or their own personal goals.  Examples of Successful Nontraditional Paths  Despite the pressure to identify a career path by the time one enters high school, many individuals have achieved success by taking nontraditional paths. For example, Oprah Winfrey, one of the most successful media personalities in history, did not attend college and instead began her career as a local news anchor. Similarly, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, dropped out of high school and instead pursued his passion for technology and innovation.  These individuals, and countless others, have demonstrated that success can be achieved through a variety of nontraditional paths. By exploring their interests and passions, they were able to identify		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the president of the United States by popular vote. I believe that this is the best way to ensure that the president is chosen by the majority of the people, and that every vote counts.  The Electoral College is a system in which each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district. This means that it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote nationwide but lose the election because they did not win enough electoral votes. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016.  I believe that this system is unfair and undemocratic. It gives more power to voters in small states than to voters in large states. For example, a vote in Wyoming is worth 3.6 times as much as a vote in California. This is because Wyoming has only one electoral vote for every 198,000 people, while California has one electoral vote for every 710,000 people.  I also believe that the Electoral College discourages voter participation. Voters in states that are considered to be "safe" for one party or the other often feel like their vote doesn't matter. For example, in 2016, only 44.2% of eligible voters in California voted, compared to 54.4% of eligible voters in Texas.  I believe that electing the president by popular vote would be fairer, more democratic, and would encourage more voter participation. I urge you to support a constitutional amendment that would abolish the Electoral College.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program, because the Seagoing Cowboys program you take lots of trips, and you will be able to visit new countries and states. In the program you will take lots of cattle-boat trips. When you take trip you will be fed and watered. Seagoing Cowboys had to take care of animals in World War ll. That is a good thing to help animals when people are in war, so they don't die. You have to serve night watchman. When look was on the ship he almost went overboard, but a small strip of metal kept him from going overboard. That is the only thing i want like about being a Seagoing Cowboy. He was happy to be alive. but being on a ship when it's stormy, you can get cracked ribs or injured, because the ship was out of controll and it was very stormy. When you have return trips, you can have lots of fun when you are a Seagoing Cowboy. When you are done being a Seagoing Cowboy, it will make you aware of people needs in other countries. Awareness will stay with you, after you learn about people needs in other countries. That is why the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great program for everyone in this world.		0
One big milestone in a person's teenage years is when they have to take a driver's test to get their license. Many people often become stressed behind the wheel during the driver's test because they are afraid of making mistakes. The people of our generation are just as nervous about these test as our older generations but what if that were to change in the future? What if, instead of driving cars where we have to be driving one hundred percent of the time, there were cars out there that allowed the car to do the driving for us? Many companies have been working on the idea of "driverless cars" in hopes that they will reshape the whole concept of driving. However, that does not mean they are a good thing. Driverless cars should not be used in the future because they could take away the focus of the driver, the future generation wouldn't know about driving basics, and they are illegal in some states.  First of all, they could take away the focus of some drivers. As these driverless cars are being invented, they allow drivers to meerly sit back in the drivers seat and enjoy the road. Sitting for thirty minutes in a car will not be enough to satisfy the boredom of some people. There are people out there who can not deal with sitting in one place for a few minutes and have to do something to keep them busy. Therefore, their focus could easily move to something else other than the road, like a fellow passenger or at the scenery around them. Driverless cars are not entirely driverless. As said in the article, "They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires." What if the driver is not prepared to take over when the situation requires? These new cars may have features of notifying an individual when they need to take over but if they are not ready because they were focused on something else, then the results could be disastirous. This is why it takes away focus from drivers.  Next, the future generation would not know about driving basics. Many teenagers today have to take drivers ed classes as they attempt to obtain a license from the BMV. But what would future generation drivers have to go through for their driving exams if we have driverless cars. As stated before, driverless cars aren't entirely driverless. The newer generations still have to learn to basics of driving even if they will be driving in a driverless car in the future. If this does not happen, then they could be in trouble if their driverless cars malfunction or they are forced to drive a regular car instead. The future generations will probably not know about the driving basics because they will think they are too far advanced for it. For example, not many people know how to drive "stick" or even know what that means even though it was vital for driving long ago. If someone were to enter a car that needed that kind of function, they would not know what to do. And the same thing applies to future generations if they would not know the driving basics.  Finally, these vehicles are against the law in some states. According to the article, "Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control ata all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars." With the government concerned about the safety of a driver behind the wheel, they will not allow driverless cars on the roads. The safety of the people is more important than to advancement of technology. Until the driverless cars have been updated to the time where they are safe for everyone, there is no way that driverless cars will be seen on the roads with regular cars for quite some time. This is why driverless vehicles are against the law in some states.  In conclusion, driverless cars should not be used in the future because they take away the driver's focus, the future generations need to learn about the driving basics that we use today, and it is illegal to use computer-driven cars. Of course, in the future, new technology will arise to give people more mobility and ways of transportation but that will not happen until everyone is safe. Many individuals are in car crashes every year from lack of focus on the road. Driverless cars can add to this problem just like any other and until we have to tools necessary to ensure they safety of the people using driverless cars, there is no way that they will be seen among the streets. 		0
 The Face on Mars, also known as Cydonia, is a large, flat depression on the surface of the planet that appears to have the shape of a human face. The depression was discovered by a US satellite-based spacecraft named Viking 1 in 1975 while scanning for potential landing sites for future manned missions to Mars. The discovery of this   face   sparked interest and curiosity about the possibility of extraterrestrial life on Mars, and it continues to be a topic of debate and wonder for scientists and lay people alike.   Since its initial discovery, scientists have studied the Face on Mars extensively in an attempt to understand its origins and significance. Using high-resolution images captured by rovers on the surface of the planet and data from orbiters, researchers have determined that the depression is likely to be the result of geological processes rather than the work of an alien civilization. The face is believed to have been formed by the flow of water and other geological activity that eroded the surface of Mars, creating the distinctive features that are visible from space.  Despite the overwhelming evidence that the Face on Mars is a natural geological formation, many people continue to believe that it could be the work of an extraterrestrial civilization. Some have even proposed that the face could be a warning sign or message from an advanced alien race that used to inhabit the planet. While these theories are intriguing, they are largely unsupported by scientific evidence and are seen by most experts as unlikely.  One thing that is certain about the Face on Mars is that it is an important area of study for scientists and engineers working to understand the planet  s geology and potential for habitation. The depression is located in a region of Mars that is high in volatiles, meaning that it is likely to contain water, which makes it an attractive target for future manned missions to the planet. In addition, the discovery of a potential biosignature on Mars, such as organic molecules or microbial life, could have significant implications for our understanding of the potential for extraterrestrial life in the universe.  In conclusion, the Face on Mars remains an intriguing and topic of discussion for scientists and lay people alike. While it is unlikely to be the work of an alien civilization, its potential significance as a site for future manned missions and a possible sign of past or present life on the planet make it a fascinating area of study. As we continue to explore Mars and uncover more about its geology and history, the Face on Mars is sure to remain a central part of our understanding of this remarkable planet and our place in the universe.		1
 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a system developed by Paul Ekman, a renowned psychologist, and Wallace V. Friesen, in the 1970s. It is a systematic approach to coding and classifying human facial expressions into six basic categories. These categories are happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust.  The FACS system is based on the idea that facial expressions are the most accurate and reliable indicators of emotional state. According to the system, every expression on the face has a corresponding muscle movement that can be observed. These muscle movements are coded based on specific criteria, such as the location of the muscles involved, the strength and direction of their movement, and the duration of the movement.  The basic idea behind the FACS system is to break down complex facial expressions into simple components that can be studied in isolation. By doing so, researchers can gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of emotion and use this information to develop more accurate measures of emotional state.  The FACS system has found applications in a wide range of fields, including psychopharmacology, clinical psychology, social psychology, human-computer interaction, and even art. For example, the FACS system can be used to analyze the facial expressions of animals when they are administered different drugs, to study the facial expressions of people with different psychological disorders, to develop more realistic computer avatars, and to design interactive video games that can respond to the emotions of the player.  One of the key advantages of the FACS system is its ability to provide objective and reliable measures of emotional state. By coding and classifying expressions based on specific criteria, researchers can minimize subjectivity and increase accuracy. The system also allows for a more nuanced analysis of emotion, as it allows researchers to differentiate between subtle differences in expression that may not be noticeable to the naked eye.  However, the FACS system also has its limitations. For example, it may not be applicable to all situations, such as when individuals are intentionally masking their emotions. Additionally, the system may not be able to capture the full complexity of emotional experience, as emotions are often multifaceted and dynamic.  In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is a powerful tool for studying and understanding human emotion. By breaking down complex expressions into simple components, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of emotion, which can have important implications for a wide range of fields. While the system has its limitations, it remains a valuable resource for research and practice, and continues to be a topic of ongoing study and development.		1
When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, Thats because they want to choose the right decision and if they choose wrong, then something terrible could happen, or you will just regret it. Sometimes you question your self and ask "should I do this or that?" sometimes you go with your own advice, or you go to a friend or someone. But in my opinion, I think you should always ask a friend, or a family member, for advice even if you think your advice is wiser/better than theirs.  Seeking multiple advice from different people is good because it makes gets you thinking about what to do in that situation like, "do I do this do I do that!" so you gather all the advice that you got from the people, you asked and you talk about it see if thats what you want to do, and you do it like I said your advive isn't bad, you just think that the other advice is better, like say you got accepted to two different colleges take your own advice then go get more advice from a family member or a friend, So you got their advice you compare it to yours, and see which one you like more. Seeking advice from other people is good, like I said It helps you with your everyday life.		0
In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This is due to a number of factors, including the environmental impact of cars, the high cost of car ownership, and the traffic congestion that cars cause.  One of the main reasons to limit car usage is the environmental impact of cars. Cars are a major source of air pollution, which contributes to climate change. They also produce noise pollution, which can be harmful to human health. In addition, the construction of roads and highways often destroys natural habitats.  Another reason to limit car usage is the high cost of car ownership. Cars are expensive to purchase, insure, and maintain. They also require a lot of gas, which is currently very expensive. In addition, parking can be expensive, especially in urban areas.  Finally, car usage contributes to traffic congestion. This can make it difficult to get around, especially in urban areas. Traffic congestion also wastes fuel, which contributes to air pollution.  There are a number of things that can be done to limit car usage. One is to improve public transportation. This means making public transportation more affordable, reliable, and convenient. Another is to build more bike lanes and sidewalks. This will encourage people to walk or bike instead of drive. In addition, we can make it more difficult to park cars in urban areas. This can be done by raising parking fees or by reducing the number of parking spaces.  Limiting car usage is good for the environment, the economy, and our quality of life. It is a step that we should all take to create a more sustainable future.  In addition to the environmental and economic benefits of limiting car usage, there are also a number of personal benefits. For example, people who walk or bike to work or school tend to be healthier than those who drive. They also tend to have a lower risk of obesity, heart disease, and other chronic health conditions. In addition, walking and biking can be a great way to get exercise and fresh air.  Limiting car usage can also help to improve social cohesion. When people live in walkable communities, they are more likely to know their neighbors and to get involved in their community. This can lead to a stronger sense of community and a more vibrant and supportive social fabric.  Overall, there are many reasons to limit car usage. It is good for the environment, the economy, our health, and our communities. We should all take steps to reduce our reliance on cars and to live in more sustainable ways.		1
 Have you ever had a friend who has shared their wisdom and experiences with you? It's likely that you have had this experience many times. However, it's important to understand that people just want to learn from your experiences and those of others. This is not a bad thing, but rather an opportunity to deepen your understanding of others and form meaningful connections.  Firstly, learning from others can help you understand their interests and hobbies, which can help you form a bond with them. By sharing your own experiences, you can also help them understand who you are and what makes you unique. This can lead to a deeper connection and a stronger friendship.  Secondly, learning from others can also help you help them in times of need. Whether it's a difficult situation or a problem they're facing, you can offer your support and advice to help them through it. This can make them feel more comfortable and supported, and it can also make you feel like you're making a positive impact in their life.  Lastly, communication is key to forming and maintaining relationships. Whether it's through social media, shopping, or hanging out at each other's homes, there are many ways to communicate with your friends and others. By staying connected and communicating regularly, you can keep your relationships strong and healthy.  In conclusion, learning from others is an important aspect of forming and maintaining relationships. By understanding who they are, helping them in times of need, and communicating regularly, you can deepen your connections with others and build strong, lasting friendships. So the next time you meet someone new, take the time to learn from their experiences and share your own. You never know what you might learn or who you might connect with.		1
Smog, acid rain, high carbondioxide levles, all of these things are due to pollution. In many contries the leaders have put a ban towards cars. Paris France, Vauban Germany, Bogota Colombia, and even the United States of America have/are thinking about putting a ban on cars or other transporting objects. Their are many advantages to limiting car usage; limiting pollutians in the air, saving money, and having a healthier life style.  Cars can cost a pretty penny espically if their new, and many low/middle class family's have trouble keeping up with the bills that come with a car. Car payments alone can run up to $300 a month. Then theirs insurance, and if your car happends to need a change of oil, or breaks theirs another 200-300 dollar  payment. That's why people are starting to buy fewer and fewer cars each year. After the peek in 2005 car percheses have droped tramendiously, with less people deciding to get a license.  Not getting you license dosn't mean you cant get around, it just means that you have to find other means of transprotatin. Biking, walking, even riding on your skateboard can get you from point A to point B. Cars are bigining to become obsoliet, not being used in larg suberbs, or highly populated cities. People have started to walk to work and that has a large impact on health. With people having privet cars they dont feel the need to have phisical activity every day. This could be contrabuting to obeasity. With cars being out of mind people are starting to get exersize just by walking to work. Cars have also contrabuted to many deaths all over the world. With new technology comming out many drivers get distracted. Wether its talking on their phones, trying to pick up something thats' dropped in the back seat, or even trying to dig something out of your purse. Not all drivers are a fault tho, many other accidents happen because of padestrians not paying attention. These accidents could be prevented though, by just getting rid of the use of cars.  Passenger cars cause 12% of greenhouse gass admitions in europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the Unites States. If we got rid of most privetly owned cars though, it world bring that pecentige down tramendously. In Paris the record high pollution finally had them pass a partial driving ban untill the thick smog cleard the city streets. congestion was down 60% in the streets of paris, and after 5 days of intensifying smog it had finally cleard.  Cars all over the world are slowly becoming less and less used. This could help the pollution, health and save money. these advantiges to getting rid of cars is going to become a topic thast we will talk alot about for ages, until cars become compleetly and totaly obsolite.             		0
 Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. It offers a flexible and convenient way for students to continue their education, regardless of their circumstances. In my opinion, distance learning is a great idea for several reasons.  First, it provides an opportunity for students who are unable to attend traditional schools due to various reasons such as having children or working long hours. For these students, distance learning allows them to continue their education while still being able to fulfill their responsibilities at home or work. This can be especially beneficial for single parents or those who are struggling financially, as it allows them to balance their education with their other commitments.  Another reason why distance learning is a good idea is that it offers a more affordable option for students who may not have the financial resources to attend traditional schools. This can be especially important for students who come from low-income families or who are struggling to make ends meet. With distance learning, students can receive a quality education without having to worry about the high costs associated with traditional schools.  Finally, distance learning can be a great option for students who are older and looking to finish their education. For these students, distance learning provides a convenient and flexible way to continue their education and improve their chances of finding better job opportunities. This can be especially important for those who may have struggled to complete their education in the past, as distance learning offers a second chance to succeed.  In conclusion, distance learning is a great idea for several reasons. It provides an opportunity for students who are unable to attend traditional schools, offers a more affordable option for students who may not have the financial resources to attend traditional schools, and can be a great option for students who are older and looking to finish their education. With its flexibility, affordability, and convenience, distance learning is a valuable resource for students of all ages and backgrounds.		1

In order to dramatically reduce greenhouse gases, a new fad is being introduced all over the world. The fad is ways to make the world more "car-free" or "car-reduced". This may sound shocking and to complicated to implement, but believe it or not, there are communites and cities that are already showing improventment with decresasing greenhouse gases that cars let off.  Vauban, Germany, is an upscale, fully functional expirimental German suburb on the outskirts of Freiburg, without cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are not found in Vauban, the main form of transportation is a public tram that runs to downtown Freiburg. Heidrun Walter is a media trainer who lives in Vauban with her two kids, Mrs. Walter states, " I am much happier this way". Completed in 2006, Vauban is a an example of a growing European and United States trend that separates auto useage from suburban life. Everything that the 5,500 residents of Vauban could need is walking distance away, the community is built in a rectangular square mile with all of the stores on a main street.  Greenhouse gases from Europe contribute to 12 percent of all emmissions, the United States is responsible for as much as 50 percent of these emmissions. To most people, these numbers would be meaning-less, but to the people of Paris, these number clearly showed with their smog covered streets. Paris hit a near-record pollution rate which caused the partial driving ban to take place. The partical driving ban in Paris was as follows; on Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to not use their cars, or be forced to pay a fine, on Tuesday, the same instructions were put in place for odd-numbered plates, this ban continued throughout the week. While this did outrage some drivers, public transit was free of charge from Monday through Friday which did help drivers who were restricted.  A national "Day without cars" was Bogota, Columbia's way to incorperate car limitations. Millions of Columbian participants found alternative ways to get to and from work. Bogota has a total of 7 million citizens who were promoted to use alternative transportation and reduce smog. Despite gray clouds and random spurts of rain, Mayor or Bogota, Antanas Mockus said, " The rain hasn't stopped people from participating." For a first time, during the previous national, "Day without cars" two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event. "These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders," said Enrique Rera, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay. Along with the "Day without cars," Columbia has also put out rush-hour restrictions, smoothed sidewalks, and cropped new resturants and upscale shopping districts.  All three cities have showed creative and functional ways to cut back on using cars, weather it be offering new ways to have a less complicated life in Vauban, Germany, limiting the number of cars that can drive on certain day in Paris, France, or creating a national holiday which encourages people to find alternative ways of transportation like in Bogoata, Columbia. It is clear that people in places everywhere are ready to make a change to cut down on greenhouse gases. The United States, as a whole has shown cutbacks on the number of vehicles and licenses being issued, in fact the amount of young people driving decreased by 23 percent from 2001 and 2009. Ultimately, the goal for the entire world is to conserve resources, lower emission rates of harmful greenhouse gases and improve safety, with the rate that cities and communities are going now, this goal without a doubt reachable.    		0
Social media has become a big part of our lives, and its impact on society is a topic that's been debated a lot lately. While some people think it's a positive force, others believe it's having a negative effect on our norms and values. In my opinion, social media does have a significant impact on society, and I'll explain why.  First of all, social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok have created a culture of comparison. People are constantly comparing their lives to others, and this can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. For example, I know a girl who deleted her Instagram account because she felt like she wasn't pretty enough compared to the other girls she saw on there. This kind of pressure to conform to certain beauty standards is harmful and can have long-lasting effects on mental health.  Another way social media is affecting society is by spreading misinformation and fake news. A lot of people get their news from social media, but it's not always accurate. I've seen people sharing false information about vaccines and other important issues, and it's scary to think that people might be making decisions based on that. This can be especially dangerous in situations where people's lives are at risk, like during a pandemic.  However, social media also has the potential to bring people together and promote positive change. For example, the #MeToo movement started on social media, and it's helped bring attention to the issue of sexual harassment and assault. It's also helped people feel more connected and supported, and it's given a voice to people who might not have had the opportunity to speak out otherwise.  In conclusion, social media has both positive and negative impacts on society. While it can be harmful in some ways, it also has the potential to bring people together and promote positive change. It's important for us to be aware of the potential negative effects and to use social media responsibly, so that we can maximize the benefits and minimize the risks.		1
I believe students can benefit from the option of distance learning classes from home under certain conditions. While in-person classes have advantages, distance learning provides flexibility that could help many students.  Distance learning allows students to learn on a schedule that works best for their individual needs and lifestyle. Some students have jobs, family responsibilities, health issues or long commute times that make regular classroom attendance difficult. Learning from home reduces barriers to participation. It also gives students more control over managing their time and environment during classes. They don't have to worry about interruptions from other students or getting to school on time.  However, distance learning is not ideal for all students or subjects. Being physically present in a classroom provides structure, accountability and face-to-face interaction that is important for many students and teachers. It is easier for teachers to gauge students' understanding and engagement in real time. Some classes like lab sciences, performing arts or career-technical programs require hands-on equipment and facilities that are difficult to replicate virtually.   To make distance learning effective, it is important that schools provide adequate technology resources, teacher training and student support services. Teachers need guidance on maintaining interactive lessons, assessing students remotely and building an online community. Students would need reliable internet access, self-motivation skills and opportunities to connect with peers. Distance classes should not replace traditional options but act as a supplement for those who truly need or want the flexibility.   With proper implementation and oversight, distance learning can be a valuable option that increases access to education without compromising academic standards or the classroom experience for other students. A blended model of both in-person and online instruction, based on individual student needs, seems most likely to benefit the largest number of learners. Overall, most students would benefit from having the choice available for at least part of their education.		1
"Standardized testing in schools is a topic that people talk about a lot. In this essay, I will explain what I think about this. In my opinion, standardized testing can measure a student's ability to some extent, but not completely. Here are some reasons why I think this way.  On the one hand, standardized tests are good because they help teachers to understand if the students have really understood the subject or not. They also help to know which student is struggling with a particular subject. This way, the teacher can focus more on that student and help him or her in the areas they are having difficulty with. Moreover, the results can help to improve the education system as a whole.  On the other hand, standardized tests cannot measure a student's creativity or critical thinking skills. They only test how well the students remember the facts or formulas from their lessons. They do not consider a student's unique talents or abilities that may not be related to the subjects being tested. Additionally, some students get very nervous and perform poorly in the tests, even if they are very intelligent and capable.  In conclusion, while standardized testing in schools is a helpful tool, it is not the only way to measure a student's ability. Schools should also focus on other methods and activities that can assess a student's skills and talents in a more comprehensive manner. By doing so, we can create an education system that is truly inclusive and fair to all students, regardless of their background, talents or abilities."		1
Dear Principal,  You are changing the school policy so students have to have a grade B average in order to participate in after school sports or other activities. This will not allow people to interact with others, get in exercise, or have any free time from school. What your doing is a bad idea.  How do you expect students to interact with others if they have no where to go after school? If this happens students will loose friends or not see them as often. Students would struggle in school because they would no one encouraging them to do better. Having friends in and out of school is very important.  Another reason is we would loose exercise because we would have no where to go. After school sports and activities are helpful because it allows students to stay in shape and stay healthy. They would have to stay at home doing homework and trying to get there grades up. This means they will start gaining weight and eating more.  Having free time from school is very helpful. It relieves a lot of stress and allows you to get school off your mind. Free time lets you hang out with friends and family. Also it allows you to go outside and be interactive, and healthy. If you have to worry about grades all the time you become stressed out and up tight. Sports allows you to let out all of those things.  These are all ways that hurt students during the school year. No one can have any fun at sports practices or games because they won't even be allowed to play. And kids won't be able to participate in other activities.  From,  Student		0
The Electoral College has its pros and cons. Either keeping the Electoral College or changing it to election by popular vote for the presidents of the U.S. will have its disadvantages and advantages of course. So, why keep it if the people don't actually pick the president?  One of the reasons why the Electoral College should be changed is because its not Democratic. The voters don't vote for the president, they actually vote for a slate of electors who are the ones who elect the president. "Because of the winner-take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states" - by Bradford Plumer. Its not fair that some states won't even have a saying in choosing the president. Everyone should have a saying even if the candidates in the winner-take all system don't want to spend their time. We live in a democratic country we should be allowed to choose the persident instead of the Electoral College. Its unfair and irrational that the electors choose the president instead of the people.  The Electoral College does help the elections avoid Run-Off Elections. Larger states will always get more attention in a campaign than a small state. This is because larger states have a bigger population than small states."The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election". -by Richard A. Posner. Just because not everyone pays close attention to the competing campaign. It doesn't been they shouldn't be treated differently than the ones who do. Everyone should be treated equally no matter what there opinion or choice is.  My opinion about if we should keep or change the Electoral College is biased. I don't think we should keep or even change it for the president to be elected by a populr vote. The electoral college helps weight the political balance in large states. It also doesn't allow the people to vote for the president. Either way i would be fine with whatever decision happens to the electoral college. I can't chose a way to argue about it cause i go both ways with my arguements.  In overal the Electoral College has its advantages and disadvantages. It all depends in everyones point of view. People should be treated equally about the decision they made. Let the people be able to choose the president of the United States its a right they have don't take it away from them because it wouldn't be fair to them. We live in a democratic country and the people have the power.    		0
 The Face on Mars has long been a topic of intrigue and fascination for scientists and the general public alike. This mysterious feature on the planet has captivated people's imaginations, prompted numerous theories and investigations, and even been the subject of conspiracy theories. The Face on Mars is an immense impact crater that is approximately 21 kilometers in diameter, located in the Gale Crater in the Tharsis region of Mars.   The discovery of the Face on Mars was made by a team of scientists working for NASA's Mars Exploration Orbiter in 1997. The image taken by the spacecraft showed an eerie face-like structure that appeared to be etched into the surface of the crater. Since its discovery, the Face on Mars has become one of the most famous features of the solar system, with millions of people all over the world taking an interest in it.   One of the first theories that emerged after the discovery of the Face on Mars was that it was the result of an ancient Martian civilization trying to communicate with humans. Some people even suggested that the face was an elaborate optical illusion that had been created by an advanced Martian society to send us a message. However, these theories have since been largely discredited, as scientists have determined that the Face on Mars was not created by intelligent beings, but rather resulted from a natural geological process.   Despite the fact that the Face on Mars is not an artificial structure, it remains a fascinating feature of the planet. Scientists are still studying the crater in order to learn more about the geological processes that formed it, as well as the role that water played in shaping the planet's surface. Some experts also believe that the crater may have been the site of a massive volcanic eruption, or that it may be a remnant of an ancient ocean that once covered the Martian surface.   In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a mysterious and fascinating feature of the solar system. While many theories have been proposed as to its origins and significance, scientists are still studying the crater in order to gain a better understanding of the geological processes that formed it and the role that water played in shaping the planet's surface. Ultimately, the Face on Mars remains an enigma that continues to captivate and inspire people all over the world.		1
dear principal, i believe that the students of this school should be required to do community service. i believe so because even if they don't want to they should still have to. doing community service helps learn about the responsibilities of being an adult. it does this by teaching them that you don't always need to get something in return for what you do. it also can help build self-esteem, because it makes you feel good about helping your town and the people in it. it also allows you to pass high school because there is a required amount of hours of community service to graduate from high school. that is important because if you don't graduate from high school you will never be able to go to college and you won't get a good job to support you and a family. that is why i believe you should be required to perform community service.		0
I believe that schools should not include meditation and mindfulness practices in the school day. While these practices may have benefits for some individuals, they are not necessary for all students and may even be a waste of time for some.  One reason why I am against the inclusion of meditation and mindfulness practices in schools is that they can be seen as a form of religion or spirituality. Some students may not feel comfortable participating in these practices due to their personal beliefs or lack thereof. It is important for schools to remain neutral and not force any particular religion or belief system onto their students.  In addition, not all students have the same learning styles or needs. While some may benefit from meditation and mindfulness practices, others may find them boring or unhelpful. It is important for schools to provide a variety of learning opportunities and not force all students to participate in the same activities.  Furthermore, meditation and mindfulness practices can be done outside of school hours if students are interested in them. There are many resources available, such as apps and websites, that can guide individuals through these practices. It is not necessary for schools to take up valuable class time for something that can be done on one's own time.  In conclusion, while meditation and mindfulness practices may have benefits for some individuals, they should not be included in the school day. Schools should remain neutral and provide a variety of learning opportunities for their students. If students are interested in these practices, they can do them on their own time outside of school hours.		1
The electoral collage is a founding fathers established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote. There are consis of 588 electory and majority of 270 electory votes is required elect the president. So there for electors generally choose by candidates political partys. Presidential election is held every four years but it on a Tuesday after the first monday.  whoever  you have choosen the states elector you would be  really be voting for your next president .  How that works is when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate elector.  And who ever has the most votes the winner "takes it all" type of sytem to the winning presidential candidates.  After the elcetion has ended your governor takes it time for the "centificate of Ascertaniment" for all the candidact ran for the preisdent . Also for the Centificate of Ascertaniment makes it in your state and shows which electors will represent your state. Richard N, jimmy C , and Bob D the u. s chamber of comerce were clearing the eletoral collage why they were thinking about doing this is beacuase many people argreed with them and told them they should beacause it wasnt right . So those are the some things that the elector candidates say about the whole procces            		0
 Dear Senator [Name],  I am writing to you today to express my views on the electoral college system and its role in selecting the President of the United States. While there is a growing consensus that the electoral college is an outdated and unfair system, I strongly believe that it should be retained.  Firstly, the electoral college system ensures that every state has an equal say in the election process. Each state is allocated a number of electors based on its population, which means that larger states have more influence than smaller states. This system ensures that the president is elected by the entire country, not just by a few large cities or states.  Secondly, the electoral college system encourages candidates to campaign in all states, not just in swing states. This is because candidates know that even if they win a state with a large number of electors, they may still lose the election if they do not win enough electoral votes overall. This means that candidates are more likely to visit and campaign in states that they may not have otherwise considered, which can lead to increased voter turnout and engagement.  Thirdly, the electoral college system provides a level of certainty in the election process. While there have been a few close elections in which the winner of the popular vote did not win the presidency, these are relatively rare. In most cases, the winner of the electoral vote will also win the popular vote. This means that there is less uncertainty and chaos in the election process, which can be beneficial for the country as a whole.  Finally, the electoral college system provides a level of transparency in the election process. Because every state's electors are publicly known and have a clear mandate to vote for a specific candidate, there is less potential for fraud or manipulation. This can help to ensure that the election process is fair and democratic.  In conclusion, while there are certainly arguments to be made for changing the electoral college system, I strongly believe that it should be retained. The electoral college system ensures that every state has an equal say in the election process, encourages candidates to campaign in all states, provides a level of certainty in the election process, and provides a level of transparency in the election process. I hope that you will consider these points when making any decisions regarding the electoral college system.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
The passage talks about all the positive and negative things that would make Venus be good to study because of some of theories of it being Earth like . The study of life on Venus would have many hard obstacles to overcome and look deeper into. "  A thick layer of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus." That would be the biggest problem to try and fix because humans who take in too much Carbon Dioxide could potentially die. "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth." That whole sentence by it self sums up how much of a complication it would be to study Venus. Astronomers are fascinated by venus that they want to know if it was once a earth like plant long before. Everytime there are some good positives about the study of Venus there's always something negative following it. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray." This a positive input to how to discover some kind of basic of life. " However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only a limited insight on the ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective." This is a barrier in research not being able to get full anwers is going to be hard to discover life. The study of Venus would make the scientist have to think harder and make more advance technology but they can do that until they get full answers on what they might come up on.   		0
The process of the electing the president is a topic commonly debated upon. This topic must be carefully examined because the President of the United States plays a major role in leading our country and must be chosen with care. The two ways of electing our president is by the Electoral College which dates back to the founding fathers, or by the popular vote which is a more modern process. The question is, should the electoral college remain the current voting process or should we change to electing the president of the United States through popular votes? Whether you are in favor of the Electoral College or against it there are consequences to both sides. Presidential election through popular votes may have disadvantages, yet the Electoral College must be changed because voters are not in complete control and reduce the probability of an electoral tie.  To begin, according to Richard A. Posner the Electoral College is a fair accurate way to elect the president. The Electoral College requires the candidates to have a multiregional appeal and allows the most thoughtful voters to decide the election unlike the popular vote. Richard A. Posner notes in his article that the Electoral College avoids a candidate that is a regional favorite to gain votes and win. The Electoral College requires the candidates to have a "transregional appeal" Posner. If we used a process that allowed a candidate with only regional appeal to be elected as President this would increase the chances of electing an ineffective, successful president. Additionally, the Electoral College allows only the most thoughtful voters to decide who becomes President Posner. candidates will be chosen more carefully and thoughtfully. These voters will have gained the most accurate information and apply this to their choice. Thus, the Electoral College has some beneficial outcomes, but the popular vote is a better choice for our system of choosing the President.  First of all, changing to electing through popular votes could fix the problem of voters not having a big say in who become the President. In Bradford Plumer's article he includes that voters can't always "control whom their electors vote for". All of the residents of the United States who choose to participate in the presidential election should be able to have their voice heard individually. Voters should not have to rely on their state electors to choose the right president. Additionally, voters not being able to have their voice hears affects which candidate becomes elected. Sometimes the electors can go against the opinion of the people Plumer. Electors should not be the only ones that are allowed to have responsibilty in picking the President of the United States. Electors could totally "defy the will of the people" and it is unfair that they are responsible for the whole process of choosing the President of the United States. Thus, the popular vote is a better choice because the people of the United States should have a bigger say in their President.  Secondly, changing the electoral college to popular vote could not only help voters have their voice heard but, it could also reduce the probability of a tie in the electoral vote.		0
In this story the author is talking about how humas have not made it on the planet of Venis. At least that we know about. The article said that scientits think there may be life or have been life on the planet.  With scientists thinking if there is something up there on the planet there is a good chance that they will be able to find out soon with all the technology we have today.  With all the things we have today I think we will find something on venus. If we do then there is a fact that there is aliens that are alive, unless they are just like us but from another planet. And that planet is closer to the sun than earth.  I think with all the things in the article we will find somthing or that there was something there on venus at some point. It could of been a trillion years ago or there is still life on it today we will just have to find out. Time is the only thing that we have on are side.		0
If i was a scientist at NASA and had to do research on of the face that is on mars i would say it isnt a human face. I think it is just a natural landform.  My evidence that the face is not really a human being is first of all it doesnt even have a body. Since they took pictures of the face, they could have croped the pictures to look real. In the pictures that scientists took of the face in 1976 to 2001 the pictures look nothing like a face. The pictures show cracks that may appear to look like a face but really isnt.  When a scientist was taking a picture on mars he noticed an enormous head nearly two miles from one end to the other end and it seemed that it was staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called cyndonia. The cause of that could have been a shadow and not a human looking back at him. Another thing is that i dont think they seen a Martian because when they said that they had pictures of a Martian, picture cant always be true because of how people crop pictures today.  So these are my reasons why i think that that face is not really a face, just a natural landform. A lot of people may believe what thay want to believe. Just remember that eveybody has there own opinion.    		0
How can someone make a better choice by hearing multiple people's opinions? Receiving multiple opinions can increase the chances of making a good and responsible choice. If someone were to ask only one person for advice, they may not choose the most responsible choice. When someone hears multiple responses, they'll most likely choose the response they hear most. Hearing advice from multiple people helps make a responsible decision and helps people who are unsure and worried about making making a bad choice.  Seeking advice from multiple people creates a responsible decision. If someone were to ask for just one persons opinion, they could make the wrong choice. The first person may not be the most responsible and don't think about the negative outcomes of making that decision. They just want to make a choice even if it's reckless. Hearing from more than one voice will give someone more options and then they can see what decision most of the people chose. However, if multiple people were choosing a bad decision, it could plant the wrong idea into someone's mind still leading to a bad choice. For example, if someone already had an idea in their head and they go to ask a few people for advice, multiple people could tell them to make the wrong choice and change the persons mindset completely. This is why it's necessary to ask people that are responsible, more specifically adults that are able to make more responsible decisions. Adult or not, it is important to ask for more than one persons opinion if you are seeking advice.  Hearing more than one opinion is super beneficial to someone who is completely stuck and unsure if they are going to make the right choice. If someone didn't have any idea on what decision to make, hearing the same response from multiple people helps a ton. It also is super beneficial when someone may think they know what choice they want to make, but hearing it from other people may reassure them or make them change their mind to make a good choice. As an example, someone may think they're about to make a good choice when in reality, they're not. The person may ask people if it's a good decision and the majority of opinions may change that persons mind.  Seeking advice to make the right choice from many people helps make a good decision even if the person may be set on one choice. As long as responsible people are being asked, a good decision is sure to be made.		0
In "The challenge of Exploring Venus", we are faced with another difficult task. We have had many hard task in our past space wise, from our first step on the moon, to the discovery of Pluto being a dwarf planet. Studying Venus closely is a worthy pursuit because, it's a challenge and who doesn't like a challenge, it would be a exploration many people from generations old and new would like rake on themselves, and possibly we could find a way to live on a planet other than Earth.  Exploring Venus is going to be extremely challenging. For example, the passage says "Venus has the hottest surfqace temperature of any planet in our solar system." This place is going to to be extremely hard to get close to because of the heat. We can't even take pictures because "most forms of light cannot penetrate the atmosphere." Our most high-tech cameras can't even get a decent picture of the surface of Venus.  Many people from the new and old generation are obbssed with space and everything to do with it. Our workers at NASA have created electronics that have been designed to last on Venus and they have survived weels in the harsh terrain. NASA is constantly discovering something new about space. They are even using designs from the past like our "mechnical computers." They are using the design of mechanical computers because the are very durabole under harsh conditions, which is what we're gonna need in order to explore Venus.  The planet Venus is very much like Earth. There are so many energy resources there. "Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels." That is great because if we lived on Venus we wouldn't have to worry about pollutting the planets as quickly as we have done on Earth. Also, we would be able to spread the electricity widely throughout the palnet.  In conclusion, exploring Venus would be a worthy pursuit for many reasons. We are going to get there one day with the way our space administrations are working. There is so much we don't know about the planets in our solar system, even our own planet. We should take the opportunity to explore whatever we can as soon as we can. That way we won't go extintic like many thing in our world.  		0
Distance learning options have become increasingly popular over the past decade, with growing numbers of students relying on online or video conferencing classes to attend school from home. While the ability to learn from one's own home offers numerous advantages - such as increased flexibility, lower costs, and more control over one's schedule - there are still a number of potential issues that must be taken into account, such as the potential for students to become easily distracted or procrastinate.   It is important to consider both the positive and negative impacts of distance learning. On one hand, there is evidence that distance learning can offer superior academic outcomes due to the focus that students have while working independently. In addition, many students who may feel overwhelmed by the more traditional environment find increased comfort and freedom in the home-based setting. On the other hand, there is also the potential for this type of learning to lead to poorer academic performance due to the lack of social interaction and peer motivation.  In conclusion, although there are both positives and negatives when it comes to providing distance learning options, the pros do appear to outweigh the cons. As such, it is essential that schools embrace this technology and provide the necessary resources to help students take advantage of these opportunities and maximize their potential.		1
Cars have been a part of our culture for some time now. Since Henry Ford created the Model T, we have been crazy about these machines. Molding, crafting, and improving since, we have come to know these as daily objects. However, with all the new and progressing theories now, is there really a need for cars? Limiting car use cold be beneficial not only for the Earth, but also for people. Limiting car use can improve people's moods, can reduce pollution, and improve community interaction.  Firstly, limiting car use could in turn improve people's moods. In Vauban, Germany, there has been an experiment of great proportion. They are living a suburban life without cars. Not only is this community close and in touch, the people are happier. As mother of two Heidrun Walter stated, "When i had a car in was always tense. Im much happier this way," it is showing that not having a car can really relax a person. Just think about it, no insurance, no car payment, no thinking if wil my car last until the end of today, just saving thousands a year and having a lot of stress put off.  Secondly, limiting car use can reduce pollution. Im almost certain we've all heard about Global Warming and Greenhouse Gases, and the devastation they do to our planet. without cars these problems are still present, but lack the massive numbers in which it was rising. Smog is a horrible kind of pollution that affects the biggest cities through the world. Paris banned cars for an entire day to remove the amount of smog in the area. This shows that pollution can be stopped. Even though they only banned even numbered license plates one day and odd another pollution still went down. If all cars were banned then pollution would have gone down even further.  Lastly, limiting car use can improve community interaction. People now dont need cars for everything. They can walk, and take trains, and carpool. All these interactions strengthen the community. Walking makes people maybe wanna buy things from stores along the way and help local stores. Taking trains can create friendships and long lasting personal businesses. Carpooling city down on emissions and reduces pollution. The community can do nothing but benefit from these.  In conclusion, limiting car use could be extremely helpful. It could improve people's moods, reduce pollution, and improve community interaction. Maybe someday we could actually get rid of cars and listen to the grinding of the pedals down the biking highways.		0
I personally think that having a policy of allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online is not a good idea. While it might seem like a good way for parents to keep track of their child's progress, I believe that it is an invasion of privacy and can lead to more harm than good.  Firstly, students should be responsible for managing their own grades and attendance, not their parents. It is important for students to learn how to take accountability for their academic achievements and to develop independence. When parents have access to their child's academic records, it can create an environment where the student feels like they are not trusted to handle their own responsibilities.  Furthermore, this policy can also create unnecessary tension between parents and their child. For instance, a parent might constantly monitor their child's grades and attendance, which can lead to the child feeling like they have no privacy or that their parents do not trust them. This can create a strained relationship between parent and child, which is not healthy for anyone involved.  Additionally, not all parents are equipped to handle this level of access to their child's academic records. Some parents may become overly involved in their child's academics and start to micromanage their child's studies. This can lead to the child feeling stressed and overwhelmed, which can actually have a negative impact on their grades.  In conclusion, I believe that allowing parents to monitor their child's grades and attendance online is not a good idea. It is important for students to learn how to manage their own academic responsibilities and to develop independence. While it might seem like a good way for parents to keep track of their child's progress, it can ultimately do more harm than good.		1
Kindness is a virtue that is highly valued in society. It is often said that a little kindness goes a long way, and this is true in many ways. While showing kindness can have positive effects on others, it can also have negative effects on the person showing kindness.  One of the most positive effects of showing kindness is the feeling of fulfillment and satisfaction that comes with it. When we help others, we feel good about ourselves and our actions. This feeling of satisfaction can lead to increased self-esteem and a sense of purpose. For example, when a person volunteers at a homeless shelter, they may feel a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction that comes with making a difference in someone else's life.  Another positive effect of kindness is the strengthening of relationships. When we show kindness to others, we create a bond with them that can last a lifetime. This bond can be strengthened through continued acts of kindness, such as offering to help a friend with a difficult task or lending a listening ear to someone who needs to talk. For example, when a person helps their friend move, they may create a bond that lasts for years to come.  However, kindness can also have negative effects on the person showing kindness. For example, when we show kindness to others, we may feel drained or overwhelmed. This can happen if we are constantly helping others without taking care of ourselves. Additionally, if we show kindness to others but do not receive it in return, we may feel resentful or hurt. For example, if a person always volunteers to help their friend with a difficult task but never receives any help from their friend, they may feel resentful or hurt.  In conclusion, kindness is a virtue that has both positive and negative effects. While showing kindness can create strong bonds and bring fulfillment, it can also drain and overwhelm the person showing kindness. It is important to find a balance between showing kindness to others and taking care of ourselves. By doing so, we can create a positive impact on ourselves and others.		1
 Dear Principal,  I believe that community service is an important aspect of a student's education. Not only does it allow students to give back to their community, but it also teaches valuable skills such as leadership, teamwork, and empathy.  I understand that some students may not be interested in participating in community service, but I believe that all students should be required to complete a certain number of hours of community service as part of their curriculum. This not only benefits the community, but it also helps students develop a sense of responsibility and civic duty.  I understand that there may be concerns about the fairness of requiring all students to participate in community service, but I believe that it is important to set a high standard for our students. By requiring community service, we are sending a message that we value the contributions that our students can make to their community, and that we expect them to be active and engaged citizens.  In conclusion, I strongly believe that community service should be required for all students. It not only benefits the community, but it also helps students develop important skills and a sense of responsibility. I appreciate your consideration of this issue and look forward to discussing it further.  Thank you.		1
Have you ever encountered a dilemma that seemed unsolvable? Did you go to a trustworthy friend for advice and possible outcomes? I think seeking multiple opinions is a great way to properly handle a situation because you are able to see from others' perspectives, you will feel less stressed and you will be able to make the best decision.  First of all, asking for a variety of opinions will let you see from others' point of view. For example, let's say you are mad at someone and want to know what to do next. You could be irrationally mad at that person! A few months back, I was real hesitant about breaking up with someone I was dating. I did not know what was the right thing to do, so I asked my friends for help. It is not embarrassing to ask for help whatsoever! I was able to see what others thought of the relationship. You cannot always rely on your own opinions to fix a problem.  Second off, you will feel a lot less stressed. Before making a decision, any person can feel tense or nervous. Before I broke up with my partner, I felt extremely anxious. I didn't know if it would be the best decision to make or not. I thought about if it would be a huge mistake and if I would live to regret it, but after my friends helped me decide, I felt a lot more calm. I was able to think clearly! Receiving assistance from others can help you feel relaxed and ready to address the issue.  Lastly, when you receive multiple opinions from others it will help you make the best decision. After you gather up views from others and calm down, you will be able to make a good decision. When I was deciding whether or not to break up with my significant other, people were strongly hinting that it was the best option to choose. In the end, I broke up with them and I'm glad I made the decision I did. If I did not seek assistance from others, I would have been even more frusterated and stressed out handling that horrid relationship.  Overall, I think seeking multiple opinions is a brilliant idea because you are able to see from other people's perspectives, feel more relaxed and certain about a decision and, thus, make a great decision. After the break up, I felt very happy and I could not have done it without help from others. 		0
Have you ever imagined allowing students design their own summer projects? Would allowing them be beneficial to their learning? Many strongly believe that if students were to design their own assignments it would give them more motivation, but if anything it is not educationally helping them. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students would not actually do their assignments, the teachers know exactly what they want their students to learn during the summer, and it's an efficient way for teachers to prepare their students for the upcoming school year.  Many students always have a way of getting their teachers to allow them come up with class assignments but that is not always the best thing to do. If it is up to them to create what they need for the summer, they will not be productive. They can create something that they think is so much fun compared to the things their teacher gives them, but it could be something completely different to the subject their work should be about. All teachers know what every single one of their students need to improve on; they create assignments based on certain subjects an individual or the whole class needs help on, so that it does not become a huge issue when entering the following school year. I mean don't get me wrong, teachers understand that the work they hand out to their students can't always be boring and when it is time to create the students assignments they should include some interesting activities for them to accomplish. Perhaps allowing them to create summer work is in some ways practically, but it is a distraction in the sense of it could take them all summer to settle down on a project they want and if that was the case then they would have wasted their whole summer of learning in just thinking about a project they want rather than simply just getting their work from their teachers. Certain people do have their own opinions, but what we always need to do is put our students education first.  This should be viewed as a great opportunity teachers have for preparing their students for the upcoming school year. A strong number of people whether it's parents, teachers from different schools, or just friends don't believe that giving their kids summer work does prepare them for the next school year. In my past summers I remember that there wasn't a time where i did not have some sort of assignments to work on and I remember I always understood the first few subjects we were learned and that was because all the assignments I worked on actually helped me when school started. Many of my friends always tell me how one simple assignment did so much for them. I would always be lost and understand the new material from the very beginning. One simple project, work book, or even a packet of a certain subject can take a student so far, allowing students to feel more at ease and also allowing them to get amazing grades from the first few weeks of school. More so, it is a beneficial way to have more students succeed when testing time roles around at the end of the year. There has been a great amount of students who do strongly agree with summer projects being teacher-designed simply because they realize how remarkable the finishing results are.  When thinking of a subject like this a number of questions run through my head like, " Would the students or I truly create something so efficient to our learning just by instructions given to us from our teachers that try to explain what we need? ". Going back to the issue on students completely misinterpreting their expectations; not all kids can come up with an assignment that covers the details they need to work on. From personal experiences there has been multiple times where my teacher allowed us to make our own projects that should cover all our subject units, but I completely failed because i would think I was doing it all correct and when it came to the due date and test time I would fail. This is just an inefficient way, especially if you want your students to actually do great in your class. I mean it also makes it so much harder for the students to recover and catch up or having to bring up their grades. In the end it's all about assuring your students will be outstanding throughout the whole school year in everything they do.  Student-designed summer projects might have a nice sound to it, but a students future should be in consideration. All these summer assignments should be teacher-designed simply because students will not complete their tasks, all teachers know the work their students need to improve on, and it's an efficient way for teachers to prepare their students for the following school year, so that it does not hit them all at once. Students could go through a great amount of stress if it were up to them and that could all end in a horrendous way, which is why it is not a great idea to allow them to create their summer work.  		0
Yes it is valuable. Why? It is because you can use it to see if the student is really paying attention or not. You can also tell if the student is bored or depressed so the you can do something about that. like it was said in the article about Making Mona Lisa Smile. This technology can tell you wether the person is happy or not. just by seeing the face that the kid or anyone is making which this will come in handy for others in the future to know. And all they have to do is use this technolghy to see wether you are really liking something or wether you are really hating something. not only that it also see that if you are making more than one expression in your image.  In conclusion, i say that this techology is nit just good in all schools around the world but good to use in everyones daily lifes and can be used to help people in hospitals and all over the world, it can be used to stop crin=mes and used to see wether someone is lieing or not. or to even indicate what the person is probably thinking or planning to do.		0
Social media is like totes awesum! I mean, where else can u share ur thoughts, feelings, and pics with ur bffs and fams? But, like, have u ever thought about how much personal info u share on social media? Like, ur full name, address, phone number, and even ur location! It's kinda scary when u think about it.  I think we need stronger privacy protections on social media. Like, it's not cool when ppl can see everything about u without ur permission. I mean, would u want some creepy stranger to know where u live or where u go to school? I didn't think so!  But, like, some ppl might say that privacy protections r a violation of free speech. They might say that we should be able to share whatever we want on social media without fear of reprisal. But, like, that's just not true. We need to have some limits on what we can share and who can see it.  For example, like, imagine if ur mom or dad shared a pic of u when u were, like, 10 years old, and now it's being shared all over social media without ur consent. That would be, like, super embarrassing and not cool at all! Or, like, what if some bully shared a mean message about u on social media, and now everyone can see it? That would be, like, so hurtful and sad!  So, like, we need to have stronger privacy protections on social media to protect us from stuff like that. We need to be able to control who can see our personal info and what we share on social media. It's not, like, asking for too much. It's just common sense.  In conclusion, like, we need stronger privacy protections on social media to protect us from unwanted sharing of personal information. It's not a violation of free speech, it's just being responsible and respectful of our privacy. So, like, let's make social media a safer and more private place for everyone! 😊		1
I disagree with the principal for making the students to do extra activities in school.  65% of students are not able to do things at school cause of stuff that happen at home.  If kids were forced to do these extra school activities they would always be in a rush,they might not be able to do it,and their grades might decline.  First, the kids will always be in a hurry. For example kids are not the best at time management most kids are really bad at time management and they are kids not grown adults. Also children might panic with to much stress cause there will always be stuff to get done in a short period of time. But at the end of it all their kids and have other things to do.  Secondly, not everyone is able to do school activities. And not all children have a ride if needed to get where needed to. Also some kids get jobs at a early age so they can help out with their living situation and parents. Some kids do sports and can't do the after school activities.  Third of all, students grades might decline. The reason I say that is even with all the extra activities in school they might loose focus. With all that work the kid might be tired. Kids will get nervous and confused trying to figure out how he can do all his work quickly.  At the end it's all about the kids. The kids should not be required to do extra activities and that is what this is about. Also don't force your kid to do something if they dont wanna do it like sports and other things related. But at the end this goes to all the teachers,parents, and staff so lets encourage kids to do what they want and whats best for them.		0
The breeze of the late summer air, it's fragrance of flowers and the occasional bakery wafting into our noses. The sounds of children safetly playing amongst themselves and soft chatters of people coincided with the smell. It seemed like an utterly new universe where we tread, thanks to no more pollution and the ruckus of vehicles beeping and swerving every now and then, the atmosphere was delightful. The advantages of banning cars or at least reducing them is that the carbon dioxide levels will decrease and business will bloom.  To begin with, banning carsreducing them will benefit our ecosystems and environments. Take Paris for example, they banned cars due to all of the smog and pollution it was emitting. Congestion, traffic, was down 60% after five days of intense smog it was worst than one of the most populated cities in the world, Beijing Source 2. That CO2 rises into the air, the atmosphere of Earth trapping all of that heat in, and it bounced back down at us. The climate would be more reasonable, there will be a less amount of traffic jams and people being late to work, and maybe some day, our Ozone Layer could replenish. Carlos Arturo Plaza from Source 3 stated, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." We as a population don't have to completely outlaw driving but more acts of carpooling and using public transportation will immensely reduce the CO2. We can all be able to give up something for the benefit of the common good, in Bogota, Columbia it has been three straight years that cars have been banned found in Source 3 and they have a population of a wopping seven million. Michael siva brings up a good point in Source 4 saying, "What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn." Elisabeth Rosenthal states that, "Mine 19 and 21 speaking of her children have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could some in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends.  Alongside with the bettering the environment, there is the sudden blooming of business and profit. With everyone on their feet and searching somewhere to hang , shop owners will be opening for business, and actually take part in the outside world. In Source 3, a valid point is relevant, "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughtout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restauraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up." There will be a fluctuation of revenue throughout all these newly built shops, stores, entertainment centers, and restauraunts. People will be more active with running, walking, and biking around the citytown. In Bogota, Columbia according to Source 3 new paths have been opening up, "It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city," stated by Mockus the city mayor. An ordinary person, Heidrun Walter, positively commented on the ban of cars, "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Consider all the factors of health, one will be fully exercised on a daily basis, there will be little to no car accidents where people have died either in the vehicle or on the sidewalks DUI, drinking and driving, will not be an pestering issue anymore.  In conclusion, the idea of banning cars is magnificant. There will be less pollution, less traffic jams, more businesses and shops and restauraunts opening to suit our needs, and just overall great for the environment. We can all join up together as a union to save our Earth, the Ozone Layer from allowing harmful objects from outer space into our atmosphere, and induce more activity amongst each other. We will all be happier and less irritated without the ruckus of cars and checkup like oil leaks, motor mishaps. Think of this new world, it could happen with one voice.		0
Vauban, Germany is the place to be it has an upscale community and has a few soccer moms nice huh? Street parking in Vauban, Germany is forbidden in what they call an experimental new district near Freiburg and Swiss Borders.  To begin with, In Vauban, Germany most families don't own cars but 57 are sold when new families and other people move there. Cars or automobiles as the german like to call it are linchpin of suburbs which mean they're affordable. Most middle class families tend to stay around the Shanghai area. Studies show that 12 percent of gas emissons are because of passenger cars. Also up to 50 percent are cars in intensive area.  Next, Paris on the otherhand is typically more smog then other euro capitals. Paris once had 147 of particulate matter per cubic meter compared to brussels in London, Reuters.  Last, Delivery Companies often argue that they lost to much revenue, later in the week they made plug in cars and hybrids carrying over 3m passengers.  In Conclusion, The so called smog cleared enough throughout the week it cleared out good enough to where they could have a ruling French party in Paris to dicuss the ban for out-numbered plates on Tuesday. Vauban often don't own cars but Heidrun says he's so happier with having a car he had always felt tense.    		0
 Is it a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? While it may seem daunting to make such a decision at a young age, there are several reasons why it can be beneficial for students to do so.  Firstly, committing to a career early on can provide a sense of direction and purpose. When students know what they want to pursue, they can focus their efforts and resources towards achieving their goals. This can lead to a more fulfilling and successful career path. For example, a student who commits to becoming a doctor early on can take the necessary courses and gain the necessary experience to achieve their goal. They can also seek out mentors and guidance to help them along the way.  Secondly, committing to a career early on can reduce stress and anxiety. When students are unsure about their future, they may feel overwhelmed and uncertain about their choices. This can lead to feelings of stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being. By committing to a career early on, students can alleviate these feelings and focus on their goals.  Thirdly, committing to a career early on can provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. When students achieve their goals, they can feel a sense of pride and satisfaction in their accomplishments. This can lead to a more positive outlook on life and a greater sense of purpose.  In conclusion, committing to a career early on can provide a sense of direction and purpose, reduce stress and anxiety, and provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. While it may seem daunting to make such a decision at a young age, it can ultimately lead to a more fulfilling and successful career path. So, if you're a student considering your future, don't be afraid to commit to a career early on  ?it could be the best decision you ever make.		1
 Venus, the second planet from the Sun, has long been a source of fascination for scientists and explorers alike. The fiery planet is known for its extreme temperatures and thick atmosphere, but despite these challenges, there is still much we know about Venus and even more to discover.  One of the first successful missions to study Venus was the Magellan mission launched by NASA in 1990. The spacecraft orbited Venus for over six years, collecting data about the planet's surface and atmosphere. The mission was a huge success and helped scientists understand that Venus has a thick atmosphere with a concentration of carbon dioxide that is over 90 times greater than that of Earth.  Since then, other missions like the European Space Agency's (ESA) Venus Express orbiter and the Mars Science Laboratory mission have provided more insights into Venus. The Venus Express mission, launched in 2005, has been studying Venus's atmosphere for over 15 years, while the Mars Science Laboratory mission, launched in 2012, collects data about Venus as well as Mars.  But while we have learned a lot about Venus, there is still much that remains unknown. One of the most fascinating things about Venus is its extreme temperatures. The temperature on Venus can reach up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface, and can drop to -460 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas of the atmosphere. These extreme temperatures pose a huge challenge for spacecraft and we have not been able to send a spacecraft to study these areas of Venus directly.  Despite the challenges of studying Venus, scientists continue to push the boundaries of exploration. In 2017, NASA announced that a new mission to Venus, called the Venus Exploration Rover (VER), is being planned. The VER mission will be designed to study Venus surface and atmosphere, including the extreme temperatures and thick atmosphere.  Exploring Venus is a fascinating area of science, and there is no doubt that more discoveries are yet to be made. With new missions coming online and scientists pushing the boundaries of what is possible, Venus remains one of the most tantalizing planets to explore. From the extreme temperatures to the thick atmosphere, Venus is a world that is yet to be fully understood, and it is up to scientists and explorers to unlock its secrets.		1
Most students have, at one point or another in their time in school, likely wished they were homeschooled. However, it may not have been possible for that to happen due to family issues, work times, or financial limitations. But now, some schools offer "distance learning"--a way for students to get the same instruction from their own home. This could be extremely beneficial in allowing students with certain problems to obtain the same education as others.  If, for instance, a student has some sort of social anxiety or stress-related medical condition, being able to attend classes from home would make it much less likely that they would have some sort of episode. They would still be getting the same or similar education as their peers without the stress of leaving home. Or, for a wider audience, if a student falls ill, they need not miss a day of education, instead still being able to recieve instruction without the fear of spreading sickness to others. Both of these instances are fairly specific, but still can show how "distance learning" can help students more than regular class time. This type of teaching could also be beneficial to the parents of students; if a perent wanted for their child to be homeschooled but didn't have the time or finances to allow that full-time, the online councilling would make homeschooling much simpler and potentially cheaper. Or if a parent has no way to transport their child to and from school, for instance if they live too far away for a walk to be reasonable but aren't close to a bus route and the parent or parents must leave for work early in the morning, the online learning cuts out the need for travel and transportation.  However, there is the issue of distraction. Surely a student left to learn at home with no teacher physically present is more likely to be distracted! But scool can be equally distracting for some students, and perhaps the more streamlined and simplified teaching style would benefit students with short attention spans or conditions like attention deficit disorder. One never really knows until the time comes.  When it comes to online "distance learning", the pros seem to outweigh the cons. Students who have medical conditions or who have temporarily fallen ill can continue to learn the same material as their peers and classmates without the probelems that their condition might cause them or others. Parents who wish to have their child homeschoolecd could do so without nearly so big a financial or time investment. And if a student needs a slightly slower or slightly faster pace of learning, they could receive that, as there could be many "distance classes" with varying paces or types of learninf for students who learn different things different ways at different speeds. On the whole, in this era of technology and ease, it seems that it should be very simple for students to receive the instruction they need in whatever way they absorb it best, and if their learning requires or is bettered by them remaining in their home and receiving instruction from afar, then it seems like that would be simple enough to achieve.		0
 What are some fun activities to do outdoors at parks? Well, there are many ways to enjoy the outdoors, but it also depends on what the park offers. Some fun activities at the park include playing golf, going for a hike, or playing sports in the field.  To begin, there are many fun activities to enjoy at the park. If you like golf, you could play a round at the park. Many parks have golf courses, and some even offer lessons. Additionally, if you are interested in hiking, many parks have trails for you to explore. Whether you prefer a short, easy hike or a longer, more challenging one, there is something for everyone.  Another fun activity to consider is playing sports in the field. If you are a sporty person, you could play soccer, basketball, volleyball, or many other sports. Some parks even provide equipment for you to use, such as soccer balls or basketballs. This is a great way to stay active and have fun at the same time.  In conclusion, there are many fun activities to enjoy at parks. Whether you like golf, hiking, or sports, there is something for everyone. So next time you visit a park, take some time to explore and try something new.		1
Have you ever had to make a really tough decision? Asking multiple people for their thought on the idea can really help. Some people might say you shouldn't ask too many people or even anybody at all because it's your decision. Although, I believe that multiple opinions can help you make a better choice. It can do so by showing the thoughts and feelings of your peers, possibly giving you a better understanding, and letting you put more thought into the idea.  One way multiple opinions can help you make a better choice is by showing the thoughts and feelings of your peers. Your friends and family are who know you best, so they could really know what's best for you. Also, you're always going to be around them so showing that you care about their opinion can really make them feel appreciated. Asking for their opinion can reveal what is most important to them aswell.  Another reason why you should ask multiple people is because it can give you a better understanding about the whole thing overall. Who knows, you could have one opinion then completely change it after listening to somebody else's. And second guessing isn't a bad thing. For example, say that you didn't know if you should go to Miami for spring break or go to New York. At first, you're leaning more towards the idea of going to New York, but then you ask your friends and majority of them say you should go to Miami. They tell you the weather is nicer, you can go to the beach, and there's also a lot of amusement parks down in Florida you can check out aswell. That ends up making you change your mind and you realize you would have a better time in Miami rather than in New York.  One last reason why multiple opinions can help you make a better choice is because it lets you put more thought into the idea. How? Well everybody has a different opinion. Meaning not everybody you ask is going to say the same thing. So by asking a lot of people, it's letting you hear their reasoning to the whole thing. That can make you compare on ideas and eventually figure out which you believe is best for you.  Just by simply asking people for their thoughts on the idea, it can make a huge impact in your choice. It shows how other people feel on the idea, shows the view of others, and can make you second guess yourself. 		0
How could a computer help improve a student's time in class? The new Facial Action Coding System developed by Prof. Thomas Huang enables computers to transfer human facial expressions into emotions. This is a valuable technology system for teachers and students to help improve learning and teaching inside of a classroom.  The new technology could greatly improve student learning inside the classroom. In the passage Dr. Huang predicts that "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." Such a technology could help teachers and students both. This would enable the teacher to slow down the lesson to help students catch up and learn or this could help teachers impliment new strategies to keep students focused and interested in learning. A teacher could possibly be able to tell if students are confused or bored but with this new system a teacher could be fully able to control the class and keep students attention.  Another way that the new Facial Action Coding System could help is to see what students understand a topic and what students need extra help, one on one with a teacher. This would help improve a students time in class by making the student more efficient and also could help teachers become more efficient with time. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." By having a computer in class a teacher could use the time with the students more effectively and this would translate into better homework and test grades from the students. In addition to just helping students with the class the system would allow teachers to see if a student is sad or upset and the teacher would be able to try to improve the students mood. A student who could be helped emotionally at school will value the new system and all of the capabilities of such system.  In online classrooms where the students do all work on a computer, the computer could generate strageties for each individual student based on a students emotions and facial expressions. "If you smile when a web ad apears on your screen, a similar ad might follow." This would allow a computer to give students a better opportunity to learn at the pace that suits that student on that particular day. This could also allow the instuctor of the class to institute different styles of lessons and more entertaining ways of learning the content of the class.  All of the capabilites of the new Facial Action Coding System are extremely valuable to not only students but also teachers. Being able to learn better within the classroom will be greatly valued by students and also teachers. Also a more direct learning experience with a better connection from teacher to student. Finally, better strategies for teaching and learning could be developed with the new technology system. All of the possibilities are very valuable to students in a classroom. Let's improve the education of students.		0
The limiting on car usage would be a huge positive on the world and the people. As everyone knows, cars now adays are the key to "Making it around the world". They say cars make your life easier and its good for the economy. Some of those facts are true but at the same time not exactly.  Automobiles are the "linchpin of suburbs". People can not live without their cars and need them for where ever they need to go work,the park,the store. Sooner or later in the future humans might not live at all with the usage of cars. In the article In German Suburbs,Life Goes On Without Cars, it says "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe". All these fums and such are being spread in the air. And in Paris, pollution was a big effect on the people. Filing the air with smokes and harmful gases that affect a persons health. Do you want to go outside and have a hard time breathing? Nope i didnt think so. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after intensifying smog. Diesel fuel was the cause of that only because France favors diesel over gasoline. This decrease in cars will be better for implications for carbon emissions and the environment.  When you buy a car, you need space for it to stay in. A space can cost up to 40,000 max. That is alot of money you could save for other appliances and daily life products. Also with a car you may get fines for speeding or anything in that state. In the article Paris bans driving due to smog Robert Duffer said motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. The less cars the better! why go through all that trouble. As well as less cars means no highway usage meaning more construction for buildings and stores. And think about it! More stores you can shop at and save more money to shop at those stores because you arent buying gas everywhere you go and paying for car insurance.  Cars are beneficial for alot of things. But for the people and our future,it would be best to cut out cars and make our lives healthier and better. It will become a huge positive on the world.		0
Dear Principal,  We know it's important to do community service to help out others that have there hands full with other responsibilities. We know that we could really help out but some of use just don't really want to give up more of our free time we've got after school. Since we have to do daily homework that our teachers give us, we know we have to do it but we also want to hangout with our friends. We can do our homework before or after we go some place with our friends. The problem is that sometimes we have a lot of homework in our hands do the next day and we sometimes don't get it all done even if we spent all day working on it and not with our friends. Something that could work for us is that we can do community service during school hours. It could be taken as one of the classes we have to take so we can learn how sometimes people really need help with what they do since it could be a lot of things they have to do or a lot of things they have to deal with. It would really help us learn more about what we want to do when we grow up and choose a path to follow for the rest of our life's because we don't want to make a mistake and have to stick to that type of work for the rest of our life's. I say it would be cool to have to do community service during school but not after school. It could be a class were we go to different places and learn more about what the person does like the day that parents come to the school and tell us what there job is, but the difference will be that we get to watch and try it out it would really help us choose more wisely what we want to do. I know that some students wouldn't like that idea at all but maybe after they have tried it out they might like it and would like to do it again. I personally would like to try that idea out and maybe it will be fun to do after all trying things helps us become wiser and know more about the things we want to do about how good our choices are. Like example we wanted to be a doctor and we did community service at a hospital watching and learning more about it and we learn that after that we really want to try something else because being a doctor wasn't what you thought it was. So you try something else like Modeling or taking Pictures and you find that you really love that. It would mean that after all that you have found something that you really like and want to do when your older or maybe you find something else you like better than Modeling and or taking Pictures like cooking, being a Chef. My point is that community service can really help us out to find what we really want to do, our true calling. Since some of the students really wouldn't like to lose there after school time it would be really cool if it was during school that students could go to different place like, restaurants, hospitals, pet stores, stores, and other places.		0
"Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions." -Nick D'Alto. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is very amusing system that can read how a human is feeling. The thought of a computer software being able to decipher what I'm feeling is shocking. I believe the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a student in a classroom is valuable. There are many reasons why I agree with the use of the FACS. For instint, technlogy would be able to identify how you feel about what you're learning, it'll make you a more emotional person,and it will help you stay on task. I think the FACS has a good chance of changing the future in a possitive way.  The FACS was desinged to to recognize six everyday emotions. This would be helpful when a student is confused or does not understand what the teacher is trying to teach. The system could then modify the classwork that the student is working on. With more practice the computer could then change the difficultiness of the assignment according to how the student feels. For an example lets say a gentelman is stuck on a math problem. The frustration that the gentelman is showing will be seen by the computer. The computer will then help the gentelman by modifying it or infroming the teacher where he is struggling. This will better his education and help out more when students are scared to ask for help.  The positive effect that the FACS has on the students is another reason why it will be vaulable in classrooms. In the passage it says," According to Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expreess emotions, but also may even help produce them. ("Putting on a happy face" actually works!)". This proves that it has been proven by experts that this system could help spread positive vibes. "Whoever thought that making faces could receal so much about the science of emotions!".  Finally, the FACS could help identify when students are bored and are not paying attention. This will help a student pay attention and not stay behind. The solution to this would be to modify the infromation to be interesting or less difficult for a student. I assume that this would decrease the amount of missing assignments and improve grades. This will be better fro the students to gain knowledge.  In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System should be used in classrooms for students. They will help improve their interest in topics at school, help the students understand better, it will help students be more possitive, and finally is will have a big impact on all of us. The Facial Action Coding System would be a new way of gaining more knowledge. It will help students and teachers understand eachother better. Overall this would be a positive impact amoung us all.                    		0
Will you join UNRRA?Luke bomberger help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more after World War 2. You can help these countries,and get them back on there feet.

Trust me you'll be as happy as a kid in a candy store if u do this  I help on my aunts Katie's farm as a boy ,and it had prepared me for hard work. On the ship you had to do a lot of things .Like:water the animals,feed the animals. They had to clean the animals stals. It might sound bad,but it's not .It might seem boring as a brick ,but I promis it isnt.  Luke had watch duty when he was coming back from talking to the captian he sliped on the ladder on his back side. That had to hurt. He had broke his ribs. He about fell over borad in the dark Alantic Ocean. He found time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Some of their games they played were baseball and vollyball. They also played :tabel tennis ,fencing,boxing,and more.  On all these details about the boat,and animals I hope you have decided to join the UNRRA.You dont have to be audacious to join. I know for sure you'll be exubrant when you join. So dont be scared just go for it. So, will you join the UNRRA?   		0
Not Using Phones while Driving  Throughout the years, teenagers have been eager to turn 16. Driving is a nerve wrecking and exciting experience at the same time. There is a good upside about driving and that would be being able to go out to places without having to pay and the time period you can stay out for is how long you desire. Even though there is a good side, there is a bad side as well. This would have to be the large amount of people that are not cautious around their surroundings and many lives have been taken away due to this. I would have to agree with the idea that says that phones should not be used while driving , my reasons for this are that peoples lives are taken away, a phone is a big distraction, and it is a law you have to follow.  My first reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because too many lives are taken everyday. Utilizing a phone while driving takes many lives every second of our daily lives. About 1.6 million lives a year end up in critical conditions or worse, dead. A phone call or text can wait, but being impatient can result in deaths. This impatiences creates danger to the person driving and everyone around them. Too many lives are taken by near accidents, crashes, distractions, and running of lights caused by usage of phones by operating moving vehicles. Many more lives could be safer if people chose to wait for their usage of phones after being off the road.  My second reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because, too many distractions are already on the road without adding a phone as another reason. Once again, using a phone while driving creates too many distractions for the driver and everyone around is left in danger. For example, phones can create delays on stop lights which can create simple accidents. The glare of a bright phone on a dark night can actually interfere with the sight of the driver and can cause loss of control or misguidance to swerving. As well as sudden loud sounds from a phone can actually scare or frighten a driver straight to a crash. Occuping phones while driving is one of the biggest reasons for caused crashes all over.  My third and final reason for not using phones while driving is because, a new law recently has been released on how using phones on the road is no longer permitted anymore. The new law was put in to ensure more safety due to all the distractions caused by phones. Since it is a new law, a new law means that it is expected to be followed, a new set out rule. It is for the safety of people and everyone surrounding. People will get punished if the new law is not followed and in my opinion, i would say that it is one of the greatest laws forced. The new law will minimize the amount of crashes caused by phones on the road all over and save many more lives and everyone around.  A phone should not ever be used while a person is driving for any type of situation, it can wait. My reasons, once again like i said before is that many lives are taken away, it is also a big distraction, and last would be that it is a new law. A phone is really entertaining and that is something people do not want behind the wheel because then it can become a distraction.  Through the whole essay all I could come to head would be about the peoples lives taken away left with a broken down family. Phones ultimately should not be used while driving and a person should not have to double think it, before they cause a new tragedy that will leave them with a lifetime of consequences and guilt.   		0
The debate over curfews for teenagers is a long-standing one, with many pros and cons to consider. On the one hand, curfews can help keep teenagers out of trouble by enforcing a set time for them to be at home or in safe places. On the other hand, curfews can interfere with the ability of young people to participate in activities that are important to their development.  Laws governing the behavior of young people in public vary from city to city. Taking the time to research the laws in place for your particular city is essential to understanding what the benefits and drawbacks of curfews really are. From a safety perspective, having young people off the streets after certain times can help guard against crime. However, allowing teenagers more freedom may also benefit them in terms of their social and emotional development.  Ultimately, creating laws or policies around curfews for teenagers is a complex issue without a single clear-cut answer. It’s an important topic to consider, as young people need protection and guidance while also having the opportunity to explore and grow in ways that are appropriate for their age.		1
DERA PRINCIPAL  We dont think you shud of changing the average .It not ferar to the other student and a c average is okay that what i thank about it .  maybe that all they can get at the last minent to pass for they can play there sport and it passing and at less it not a d .  And if you reas the average to a b you wont have anyone planing for the time and we will loss like ever game  What im tring to say if you raes that averag no one will be planing sport olee but the smart kids well be planing and that going to be funny and sports are my thing and i realy wont to be a football player for an NFL  teem and i wont to be the best and how am i supst to do that and your thing to reas the averages to a b and i passing with a c. And i realy dont think that fear and im vere good at what i do and i dont think your doing a vere good job and that the reasn you shudent cang the average for the school and in i dont think any one well like that anyways and y would you do that anyways cuz that realy dumm of you and perant wouldent like that . then you well be geting com plants from pernts about y the kid isent plan for the time and i dont think you wont to be and that .so ples dont chang the average by STUDENT_NAME		0
The author presents the reader with the idea that studying Venus is worth all the dangers and risks. They made sure to point out that travels should not be limited by the dangers and risk of the travel but expanded to meet the edges of imagination and challenges. The author has done well supporting their idea of the worthiness of studing Venus. They have shown and explained both the dangers and perks to studying Venus, plus the ways around the risks.  The author has described the negative, dangerous conditions of Venus's surface and atmosphere. "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than whate we experience on our own planet" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). The author is showing how dangerous the conditions can of Venus can be and how they are more extreme than anything humans have face on Earth. The author shows the readers a way that humans can study Venus that is much safer, along with technologies that will increase the information that humans back on Earth will recieve. "NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray..." (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This shows that scientists are coming up with ways to make exploring Venus a little safer, still not the easiest conditions but survivable enough to gain more information on the captivating planet. The author explains that there are other approaches to studying Venus, such as simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that can last up to three weeks in the conditions of Venus and the possibility of using old technology is also in the air. "Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers..." (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Since modern computers are delicate when it comes to extreme conditions, mechancical computers, that have mechanical parts, can withstand more pressure, heat, and other conditions that it will face on Venus. This evidence shows that people are looking for a way to make exploring safer and striving to meet more intimidating endeavors. The strive to meet challenges will give us more ways and technologies to explore more of Earth and other planets similar to that of Earth.  The author has done well in supporting his idea by showing both sides, the dangers and worthiness and steps scientists are taking for exploring Venus. With the work towards meeting the challenges faced on Venus, exploration will not only give insight of the planet but also will lead humans into many equally challenging, intimidating endeavors. There is much to be explored and humans need to rise to the challenge, finds ways around the danger, and expand to the ends of imagination and innovation.		0
 Introduction  Facial action coding system (FACS) is a research model that was developed in the 1970s by psychologists Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen. It is a way of categorizing the smallest units of facial movements that are used to create emotions, expressions, and moods. FACS is based on the idea that facial expressions are not just a reflection of emotions, but are also a way for individuals to communicate their emotions and intentions to others.  The FACS system involves the identification and classification of facial movements into distinct units called action units. These units are defined by the specific muscles that are involved in the movement and by the range of movement that the muscle can make. The FACS system consists of six major categories of action units: eyebrow raisers, eye wrinklers, crow's feet, lip raise, lip squeeze, and chin raise.  Eye movements  One of the key aspects of FACS is the categorization of eye movements. The system identifies three types of eye movements: the inner eyebrow raiser, the outer eyebrow raiser, and the eye wrinkler. The inner eyebrow raiser refers to the movement of the muscle that raises the inner part of the eyebrows, while the outer eyebrow raiser refers to the movement of the muscle that raises the outer part of the eyebrows. The eye wrinkler, on the other hand, refers to the movement of the muscle that causes the skin around the eyes to wrinkle.  Lip movements  The FACS system also categorizes lip movements into six distinct units: the upper lip raise, the lower lip raise, the lip squeeze, the open mouth, the pursed mouth, and the chin raise. The upper lip raise involves the movement of the muscles that raise the upper part of the lips, while the lower lip raise involves the movement of the muscles that raise the lower part of the lips. The lip squeeze refers to the movement of the muscles that compress the lips together, while the open mouth refers to the movement of opening the mouth widely. The pursed mouth refers to the movement of the muscles that compress the lips together and pull the edges of the lips inward, while the chin raise involves the movement of the muscles that raise the chin.  Chin movements  Finally, the FACS system categorizes chin movements into two distinct units: the chin raise and the head tilt. The chin raise involves the movement of the muscles that raise the chin, while the head tilt involves the movement of the head backward or forward on the neck.  Conclusion  Facial action coding system is a powerful research model that has been used extensively to study facial expressions and emotions. The system identifies and categorizes the smallest units of facial movements that are used to create emotions, expressions, and moods. The FACS system has important implications for communication and social interaction, as it demonstrates how the subtle movements of the face can convey complex emotions and intentions. Further research is needed to fully understand the nuances of facial expression and the role that it plays in communication and social interaction.		1
Duke Ellington dedicated his nearly 50-year career to perfecting the jazz genre in an era that didn't always accept him and his music. From racial discrimination to being overshadowed by white jazz musicians, Ellington faced a number of obstacles in his attempt to become one of the great jazz legends. Despite the odds, Ellington persevered and overcame these challenges with determination, finely honed skills, and his unflinching faith in jazz.  Ellington’s inspiring words, "A problem is a chance for you to do your best" echoes his own journey and offers a crucial life lesson. Any obstacle can be a great opportunity to grow and achieve something that may have seemed impossible before. With hard work, dedication, and a positive attitude, anyone can find a way to reach the goal. I believe that if we learn to view problems and challenges as opportunities to push ourselves and uncover our hidden strengths, then nothing is ever truly impossible.		1
  Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can improve the quality of life in urban areas. The passage provided offers insights into the benefits of car-free cities, including reduced air pollution, improved public health, and increased economic productivity. By examining the evidence from multiple sources, it is clear that limiting car usage can have a significant impact on the environment and society as a whole.  One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in air pollution. Cars are a major source of air pollution in urban areas, emitting harmful pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. According to the passage, the smog in Paris was so severe that it rivaled Beijing, China, which is known for its high levels of air pollution. By limiting car usage, cities can significantly reduce air pollution, improving the health of their citizens.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in public health. The passage notes that the lack of physical activity due to car dependency can lead to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as cycling and walking, cities can encourage their citizens to lead healthier lifestyles. Additionally, the reduction in air pollution can also lead to a decrease in respiratory problems and other health issues.  Moreover, limiting car usage can also increase economic productivity. The passage notes that the construction of bicycle paths and public transportation systems can lead to increased economic activity, as people are more likely to shop and spend money in areas with good public transportation. Additionally, the reduction in traffic congestion can also lead to time savings, which can increase productivity.  However, some may argue that limiting car usage can lead to increased traffic congestion and reduced mobility. The passage notes that the reduction		1
The decision to extend the school day has been a topic of discussion for many years. While some people believe that extending the school day can lead to better academic performance, others argue that it can have negative consequences on students and teachers. In this essay, I will analyze the consequences of extending the school day on both students and teachers, considering the effects on their physical and mental well-being, as well as their personal lives.  Firstly, extending the school day can have negative consequences on students' physical and mental well-being. Studies have shown that students who attend school for longer hours have a higher risk of obesity, sleep deprivation, and stress. Longer school days can also lead to a decrease in physical activity, which can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle and an increased risk of health problems. Additionally, students who attend school for longer hours may experience burnout and fatigue, which can negatively impact their academic performance and overall well-being.  On the other hand, extending the school day can also have positive consequences on students' academic performance. By providing more time for learning and studying, students may be better prepared for exams and tests. Additionally, longer school days can provide students with more opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities and clubs, which can help them develop important skills and interests.  However, extending the school day can also have negative consequences on teachers' work-life balance. Teachers who are required to work longer hours may experience increased stress and burnout, which can lead to decreased job satisfaction and a higher turnover rate. Additionally, teachers who work longer hours may have less time for their personal lives, which can lead to decreased family time and social isolation.  To address these potential issues with the decision to extend the school day, schools can explore alternative solutions. For example, schools could provide students with more opportunities for physical activity outside of school hours, such as after-school sports teams or clubs. Schools could also provide students with more flexible schedules, allowing them to attend school at different times or attend school part-time. Additionally, schools could provide teachers with more support and resources, such as additional staff or training, to help them manage their workload and maintain a healthy work-life balance.  In conclusion, the decision to extend the school day can have both positive and negative consequences on students and teachers. While extending the school day can lead to better academic performance		1
The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and communities. This is evident in various parts of the world where efforts are being made to separate suburban life from auto use. By adopting a more smart planning approach and reducing reliance on cars, communities can experience benefits such as improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and increased access to public transportation.  One example of a car-free community is Vauban, Germany. Vauban's residents have given up their cars, and the streets are completely car-free except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs and a few streets on the edge of the community. This experiment has resulted in 70 percent of families not owning cars and 57 percent selling a car to move to Vauban. Residents report feeling happier and less tense without the burden of car ownership.  Reducing car usage is important for addressing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can go up to 50 percent. By limiting car usage, communities can contribute to a significant reduction in emissions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency is promoting "car reduced" communities, and legislators are starting to take action to increase public transportation options in suburbs.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is improved air quality. Paris enforced a partial driving ban due to smog, and it resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion. Cold nights and warm days caused air pollution to trap car emissions, and diesel fuel was identified as a major contributor to the problem. By reducing car usage, cities can significantly improve air quality and create a healthier environment for residents.  Limiting car usage also promotes the development of more accessible communities. Bogota, Colombia, has been implementing car-free days for several years. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during these days. The turnout has been large, and people have embraced alternative transportation options. This has led to the construction of bicycle paths, parks, sports centers, and improved sidewalks in Bogota. Other cities around the world are also adopting similar initiatives to create more walkable and accessible neighborhoods.  In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. It can lead to improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and increased access to public transportation. Communities that have embraced car-free or car-reduced lifestyles have reported increased happiness and reduced stress. As efforts to limit car usage continue globally, more people are recognizing the benefits of smart planning and reduced reliance on cars.		1
Summer Projects  By: Generic_Name  Students are in school for 7 hours a day, 45 hours a week, 180 hours a month, and 180 days a year which is a very long time. Many schools in the United States require students to complete a project/assignment to assure that they keep learning over the summer. Students usually feel overwhelmed and stressed about these summer projects because of having to do assignments during their break. I believe that summer projects should be student designed because it allows students to freely choose a topic and not be stressed or worried throughout the whole summer.  When students get assigned summer projects they usually ignore or not do them because the topic might be too boring, hard to do, takes a long time, etc. That's mainly because our teachers don't let them be student designed projects. Student designed projects are when the student gets to choose their own topic, do the work they want to do, and do everything based on what they want. Students hope that it could be student designed projects so it could take some weight off their shoulders and making it a topic they are comfortable with.  Counter Claim: Summer projects should be teacher designed because not all students have great decision making abillities and don't have the skillset to do a project without the teachers help. If it were student designed then they would most definitly go off topic or show poor work and effort on the project. Teacher designed projects are when the teacher is in control. For example, they choose the topic, they choose what research you need to do, they choose if its an essay or a presentation, etc. Teacher designed projects help students get ready for the upcoming school year and what they are gonna be learning in class.  Student designed projects can help the students by learning how to do things on their own, help them gain amazing decision making skills, and gain experiences to help them later on in life. When the teacher's in control for everything then the student may lack in motivation or the will to even do the project. These projects can't help a student grow and learn if they are restricted to certain things that they can and can't do. Students should have the ability to do summer projects on their own with no stress and/or no restrictions.  In sum, students get assigned projects or assignments to take home over the summer so that they could keep learning even during the break. Schools usually make these projects designed by the teacher(s). I believe that these projects should be student designed because summer is meant to be our break, we shouldn't have to have stress or anxiety because of these projects during our summer. Student designed projects can help us gain experiences as a student that we would never learn if they were teacher designed. They also help students feel that they are in control and it could help a student thrive to higher expectations.                                                                              		0
As an eighth-grade student, I believe that requiring community service or extra punishment for students who violate school regulations is an effective way to promote positive behavior and a sense of responsibility among students. In this essay, I will research and compare the benefits of each approach and analyze their impact on students and the school community.  Community service is an approach that requires students to perform volunteer work in their community as a form of punishment for breaking school rules. This approach has several benefits for both the students and the school community. Firstly, community service provides students with an opportunity to give back to their community and develop a sense of empathy and compassion for others. This can help to reduce the likelihood of future rule-breaking behavior, as students become more aware of the impact their actions have on others.  Secondly, community service can help to improve students' social skills and sense of belonging. By working with other volunteers, students can learn to communicate effectively, work collaboratively, and build relationships with people from different backgrounds. This can help to foster a sense of community and reduce feelings of isolation or exclusion that may contribute to rule-breaking behavior.  On the other hand, extra punishment, such as detention or suspension, is another approach that can be used to deter students from breaking school rules. While this approach may be effective in the short term, it can have negative consequences for both the students and the school community. For example, students who are punished excessively may become resentful or feel unfairly targeted, which can lead to further rule-breaking behavior or even dropout.  Additionally, extra punishment can create a culture of punishment and retribution within the school community, which can undermine the positive relationships and trust that are necessary for a successful learning environment. This can lead to a cycle of negative behavior, where students feel more and more isolated and disengaged, and are less likely to succeed academically or socially.  In conclusion, I believe that community service is the more effective approach for promoting positive behavior and a sense of responsibility among students. This approach provides students with an opportunity to give back to their community, develop empathy and compassion, and improve their social skills. On the other hand, extra punishment can have negative consequences for both the students and the school community, and can create a culture of punishment and retribution.  As an eighth-grade student, I have personally experienced		1
In the article "The Challenge Of Exploring Venus" the author gives the readers information about venus before the author tries to make his/her claim torwards the readers. and this claim is "Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents" and with supporting this cliam there are alot of great details in the aritcle that the author uses to get his/her piont across. In the article before the author gets to his claim he/she starts off with a questions which states "If our sister planet is so inhospitable,why are scientists even discussing further visits to its sirface"(paragraph 4).This question give the readers a thought and feeling to what the author is trying to claim.  In this section of this draft theses were the best surpporting deatils to explain information about the authour claim.  In paragraph 5 the author tells readers about NASA  and this paragraph explains that NASA is trying to come up with an soultion to the conditions on surface of Venus and that would allow scientists to float above the fray. This is important because the atomsphere of venus is very strong compared to earth and mars atomsphere and that puts exploraers in danger. Also in paragraph 6 resceachers are trying to make better and improve machines that will surive on Venus. so that resacecher can get rocks, gas for the better knowledge for them to know more about venus.  The last supporting detal is thier is another project reseachers are trying to use to get more information about venus which is to use old technolgoy called " mechanical computers" these devices were frist made in the 18000s and played an important role during WW1 in the 1940s, these decives are important to the rescaechers because the computers makes calcualtions by using gears and levers and which doesnt require electronics,This is important because modern techenlogy is too strong today and is much more delicate but the machanical oarts of the old computers can be made more resistant to pressure heat and other forces on venus.  Becuase of the author cliam and deatil. Readers now the importance and struggles rescerachers go through to know more about venus. NASA should continue to study earths sister planet, also find a safer way for researchers to get on earth,for the importantce of everyones kownledge.     		0
In today's modern society, technology has had a lasting and positive impact. It has enabled us to be more connected than ever before, advancing communication and giving us access to vast amounts of information without ever having to leave home. From its use in medical breakthroughs and scientific exploration, to its presence in various markets, there is no denying the many ways that tech has shaped our lives.   Technology has made it easier to make connections, research topics, and manage information. With so many functions now digitized, businesses are able to more quickly and effectively reach customers and generate profits. Social media platforms have also enabled people to connect with others both near and far. Beyond that, the use of technology can provide people with access to job opportunities and the tools they need to solve complex problems.  In short, the effects of technology on our society are significant, and the landscape of its applications and functions continues to evolve. With its help, we have been able to better navigate the ever-changing world and maximize our potential, on both a personal and sociological level.		1
 The topic of the electoral college system is a contentious issue, with many people questioning whether it works as intended. The electoral college is a group of electors who are appointed by each state to cast their votes for president and vice president of the United States. The system has been in place since the founding of the country and is designed to balance out the influence of states in the deciding of the presidential race.  One of the arguments in favor of the electoral college system is that it gives each state an equal say in the presidential race. This is especially true in smaller states, where a candidate may have only a small margin of victory. By having the opportunity to cast electoral votes, smaller states can exert a greater influence on the race.  However, criticism of the electoral college system suggests that it does not accurately reflect the will of the people. Critics argue that the system has been manipulated by political parties and special interest groups, in order to secure a victory in certain states. They also argue that the system does not account for the diversity of the electorate, as certain states with the same number of electors may have vastly different populations.  Another criticism of the electoral college is that it tends to favor candidates who win in highly populated states, such as California, New York, and Florida. This can lead to a candidate who wins the popular vote, but loses the election to a candidate who wins in key swing states.  In conclusion, the electoral college system can be seen as both a useful and a limiting system in the election process. While it does give each state an equal say, it also may not accurately reflect the will of the people, and may be subject to manipulation by political parties and special interest groups. Whether the electoral college system does or does not work, it is clear that it continues to be a vital part of our democratic process.		1
 Venus is the second planet in our solar system and the brightest planet in our night sky. It is often referred to as the Earth's sister planet due to its similarities in size, composition, and atmosphere. However, despite these similarities, Venus is a completely different world from Earth, and scientists have been exploring its mysteries for centuries.  The surface of Venus is shrouded in thick clouds, making it difficult for astronomers to study. In 2010, NASA launched the Magellan spacecraft, which orbited Venus and collected data on its surface features. The Magellan spacecraft found that Venus has rugged terrain, mountains, and vast flat regions. The most famous geological feature on Venus is called the "Venus shield," which is a massive impact crater that covers most of the planet's surface.  Venus is also home to a thick and toxic atmosphere. The atmosphere is composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds made of sulfuric acid. The pressure on Venus is 92 times greater than on Earth, making it impossible for humans to visit without specialized equipment. However, robotic spacecraft have been able to withstand the harsh conditions of Venus's atmosphere and provide valuable data.  One of the most intriguing aspects of Venus is its thick atmosphere and the greenhouse effect. The thick atmosphere and greenhouse effect cause the planet to have a runaway greenhouse effect, making Venus one of the hottest planets in our solar system. The average surface temperature of Venus is around 460 degrees Celsius, which is hot enough to melt lead.  Despite the harsh conditions on Venus, scientists have discovered signs of life on the planet. In 2012, NASA's Curiosity rover landed on Mars and detected methane in the Martian atmosphere, which is a potential sign of biological activity. Scientists have also been exploring the possibility of life on Venus for many years, and the recent discovery of water in Venus's atmosphere has added to this excitement.  In conclusion, Venus is a complex and fascinating planet. With its similarities to Earth and differences in atmosphere and geology, it is an ideal planet for scientists to study. While it is impossible for humans to visit Venus currently, robotic spacecraft have been successfully exploring its surface and providing valuable data. The discovery of potential signs of life on Venus only adds to the mystery and excitement surrounding this planet. As our understanding of Venus continues to grow, we can only imagine the secrets it holds.		1
Phones & Driving  People should not be able to use their cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It is dangerous and illegal to text while driving. Everyday people die in car accidents, because they use cell phones while driving. People who use cell phones while driving are putting themselves and other people in danger; therefore, they are likely to get hurt. Drivers that are distracted by cellphones are likely to not pay attention to the road or be aware what is happening on the road. Three reasons people should not use their phones while driving is that they cause distractions, accidents, and injuries.  People should not use their phones while driving because they cause distractions. People can easily get distracted by being on the phone with someone while driving. Some distractions are interruptions and entertainment by engaging in talking to someone outside your car and not paying attention to the other people or vehicles around you. Drivers should always pay attention to the road, because it is uncertain what might happen particularly, if the driver is not being careful while driving. In this case, they are more likely to have a crash.  Another reason people should not use their phones while driving, is because accidents happen when drivers do not focus on their surrounding. Operating a phone while driving is equal to; talking to people in your vehicle, or tampering with the radio instead of paying attention to the road, in regards to driving hazards. Some drivers that use cell phones while driving, cause accidents; therefore, they end up have to face serious consequences.  Finally, drivers should not use phones while driving because it can cause injuries. People can suffer pain and be all bruised up, because of the irresponsible driver not paying attention to the road. In addition, some injuries sustained as a result of cellphone use while driving, results in death. Some injuries due to the use of cellphones while driving can cause victims to have internal bleeding, skull fractures, or head, brain, neck, back injuries, and so on. In order to prevent injuries, the driver of the car should turn their phone off at all times while driving. When the driver gets to their destination, then they can resume using their phones. People should only use their phone before or after driving.  People should not use their phones while driving because they cause distractions, accidents, and injuries. Cellphones use while driving can greatly increase the risk of having an accident. Drivers that drive while not paying attention, are putting others' lives at risk and that is selfish. While driving, people should look out for signs and other things like animals and people. If someone calls the driver, then the driver can ask the person beside them to answer it.  Eliminating cellphones is the best way to save people lives.            		0
Would you want to be burned at 800 degrees Fahrenheit? No, that just sound to painful you might say. Scientists at NASA speculate that Venus's surface on the planet can average those temperatures. In this essay I will talk about how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit and evidence that backs my claim up thoroughly.  Going to another planet seems so dangerous and so far out of our mind that we don't think about this idea on a regular basis. The text states in paragraph 3, "a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures avereage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encouter on Earth." This quote shows how much more dangerous Venus is than Earth just simply based on the atmosphere of the planet and that harsh conditions that cover it. Another piece of evidence is this in paragraph 4, " Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such asn valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of Venus seems indisputable." This quote shows how Venus is so close geographically and distance wise to Earth based on some land features. Researchers find that getting even 30 miles from the surface of the planet the temperatures would still be at roughly 160 degrees Fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to Earth's sea level.  Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is so magnificant of a planet because we have never experienced a planet so much like our own. Our travels shouldn't be limited by dangers or doubts that we may have but should meet our endeavourous wonders and imagination of the planet and travel.    		0
Dear Principal,  I do believe that students should take part in community service as it is a helpful act toward the community in which you and I live in. Would you rather live in a community that is trashy and that looks bad, or would you rather live in a community that is superb in its cleanness? If you asked me, I would rather live in a clean community, wouldn't you?  Now I also believe in assigning community service to those who volunteer in doing the service. Also, the students who get into major trouble like suspension per say, should also be assigned for community service. Its kind of like how prison makes the prisoners do extra work around the prison, because its not like they just sit there in their cells all day.  Some students may think that helping the community is important, and if that may be the case, then let them feel free to take part in any kind of community service their heart desires to take part in. I wouldn't call that a bad thing at all to let them volunteer if they wanted. But, suspension rules should still apply if they wanted to or not. One of the goals for the school board is to let the students think that it is a good thing to help others in any kind of good way.  Some students might also think that its a waste of time and that they just don't want to do it. That should be totally fine, i wouldn't force any student to do the community service if they simply just didn't want to. But once again, suspension rules should still apply towards any student. Suspension rules also are that a student who has committed a bad deed and has a suspension coming their way, should be forced to participate in the community service to make up for the bad they have caused.  Helping pick up trash and tutor elementary students is just magnificent. I come from a very bad and messed up community in Detroit, Michigan. A lot of bad things occurred there at the hands of gangs and other people who were even in school but no one gave a care to give them any kind of punishment for it. For that reason, I think its safe to say that community service is a wonderful thing to take part in, but only if you want to and only based on suspension rules.  Sincerely, a Fellow Student		0
 Dear State Senator,  I am writing to you today to discuss the importance of the Electoral College in our voting system for the President of the United States. While the College has come under scrutiny in recent years, I believe it is an essential part of our democracy and should be preserved.  The Electoral College was established as a compromise between the election of the President by popular vote and the appointment of the President by the Congress. It serves as a vital check on the power of the majority and ensures that all voices are heard in our democracy. Without the Electoral College, candidates would only need to focus on large cities and populous states to win elections, neglecting the needs and concerns of smaller states and rural communities.  Moreover, the Electoral College encourages candidates to expand their outreach and build coalitions across different regions and demographics. This is exemplified by the fact that the winning candidate in the popular vote has not always won the election. In fact, this has happened four times in our country's history: Andrew Jackson in 1824, Samuel Tilden in 1876, Al Gore in 2000, and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Without the Electoral College, candidates would have little incentive to appeal to a broad base of voters, potentially leading to a lack of representation for some communities.  Some argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic as it can override the popular vote. However, this is not a valid argument as the Electoral College has always been a part of our democratic process. Furthermore, the Electoral College is not a random collection of representatives, but rather a group of elected officials who are accountable to their constituents. Any attempt to change the system would require a constitutional amendment, demonstrating the complexity and significance of such a change.  In conclusion, the Electoral College is an essential component of our democracy that ensures the voices of all Americans are heard in the election of the President. It encourages candidates to build broad coalitions and represents the interests of all communities, regardless of size or location. I hope you will consider these arguments and work to preserve the Electoral College as an integral part of our democratic system.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
 The life of a cowboy can be a challenging and thrilling ride, with the excitement of roping cattle and the thrill of the open range. But for one brave cowboy named Tex, his most adventurous ride would come as he set sail on the high seas, riding the waves of the ocean as a rodeo clown.  Tex was a seasoned cowboy, with a heart for adventure and a love for the thrill of the wild. He had spent his entire life on the range, roping cattle and competing in rodeos across the country. But one day, Tex received an invitation to perform at a special rodeo at sea, and he knew he couldn't resist.  As he set sail on the ship, Tex was overwhelmed by the excitement and energy of the ocean. The waves crashed against the deck, the wind howled in his ears, and the salt air filled his nostrils. He couldn't wait to get out there and ride the waves as he had never done before.  When the rodeo began, Tex was a spectacle to behold. He donned his bright yellow cowboy outfit, complete with a large hat and spurs, and he jumped on board the rope horse with a grin on his face. He looked out at the ocean, with the waves rolling beneath him, and he knew that he was about to have the adventure of a lifetime.  As he rode the waves, Tex was in his element. He was fearless and confident, whipping his rope around in tight circles and performing daring tricks on the horses. The crowd of people on the ship cheered and clapped, amazed by his skill and bravery.  For Tex, this ride was unlike any other. He had never experienced the thrill of riding the waves before, and he knew he never would again. As he surfed the ocean, he felt alive and free, like nothing could ever stop him.  In the end, Tex returned to the rodeo as a hero, with stories of his wild ride on the waves. He had proven that he was not just a great cowboy, but a true thrill-seeker, willing to take on any adventure that came his way. And as he looked out at the horizon, he knew that his next adventure was just waiting for him, on the open range or on the high seas.		1
The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supports this idea by stating in paragraph 8, "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." This statement supports my claim by explaining how the author believes no one should let the fear of the dangers that may arise stop them from exploring the world and beyond. Instead the author believes people should go after whatever they want to find. Paragraph 8 also states, "Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." This evidence explains how the author feels that there will be scary and intimidating obstacles that will arise on the journey of exploring the planet with the hottest surface tempurature in our solar system, but the author believes the curiosity of humans leads us to danger. The author also believes that danger shouldn't stop anyone who is curious from exploring. This article may talk about serious dangers, but also gives ideas for humans to study Venus without being put it any danger. The author states in paragraph 5, "NASAs possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape." This solution may prevent any harm to humans who want to study this planet and learn more about it. This solution gives people a chance to stay curious, and not think about the dangers. Only think about the journey and mystery that lies ahead. 		0
Throughout our entire world's history, learning has become an essential factor in our progression as a society. Schools provide a free and convenient resource for kids not only to pick up on educational skills, but to also acquire important traits and attributes that will be essential to them later on in life through personal experiences. Even though some may feel as if going to school is an unnecessary way to truly educate the youth, students attending online classes at home is not beneficial due to the fact that it'll cause a disturbance to life functions that'll negatively affect this generation and the others after.  Having connections to people is one of the most vital parts of human life, as it's been shown through studies that people's mind cease to function properly without any human interaction. Attending a school environment doesn't ensure, but encourages students to interact with their fellow peers allowing for a potential relationship or bond to be formed. Not only does this allow for potential relationships, but it also provides as a way for kids to acquire essential social skills that are needed in order to progress in life. As a little kid, I was an introvert that didn't like to go out into public in fear of big crowds. Eventually I would attend elementary school, where not much changed about my shyness until I found a group of people who shared similar interests as me. Having those connections with other kids made me realize that this world was not such a scary place where the only people that truly gets you is your family. From then on I transformed into an outgoing soul not being afraid to meet new people or voice my opinions in the face of adversity. Others may say that there can be other ways to form connections with people such as: sports,clubs,and ect. What they fail to take into account though is the students who aren't interested in sports, or the students who aren't motivated enough to find clubs that they may be interested in. Continuing to require students to attend school will at least provide another way for kids to interact with each other and possibly make connections.  Another reason why attending online classes from home is a detriment to society, is because it allows students to stay in a comfortable environment and doesn't set them up for their future. In life all humans have found or will find themselves in uncomfortable situations, or facing a challenge that they may not be motivated complete; ultimately whether we decide to tackle these obstacles, or divert away from them will determine whether or not we will be successful in life. Traditionally many kids' future plans after graduating high school is attending a college and thereafter finding their dream career. In college, many students discover the hard truth that they are less concerned whether their students show up to class or learn the material unlike high school. If schools allow students to take online classes from the comfort of their house, they're doing them a disservice by not preparing them mentally for the times they may not want to get up and go to class, but have to in order to learn the material. Or in another case to find a desirable career, there will be plenty hardships and obstacles that will have to be faced in order to accomplish this goal. But kids who were always in a comfortable setting and never pushed outside their comfort zone will find themselves backing down from these obstacles as they're not mentally prepared to tackle these uncomfortable obstacles. Although it's kids have to continue to motivate themselves in different situations, school serves as an extra task to ensure that kids are able to acquire this skill of self motivation.  Physical schools not only serve as a haven for educational purpose, but also allows kids to get daily essentials needed in order to live. Many kids coming from low income families and/or living in a poor area, find that school is a safe and stable environment where they are able to escape their harsh reality. For example, in Washington D.C., three out of five kids (ages 5-18) would find themselves suffering from starvation if it wasn't for their school lunch. This devastating number would only increase if schools if schools allow kids to take online classes instead of requiring them to attend school.  Schools have played a major part in our advancement and progression as a society. Since youth they've provided experiences and developed strong traits and characteristics that'll continue on with us as we progress in our lifetime. Although as some may feel as time continues we won't need this physical building to educate, it serves as a deeper purpose to build character and mentally prepare kids for life.                       		0
 Driverless cars are a technological innovation that has the potential to revolutionize the way we travel. These self-driving vehicles use sensors, cameras, and other technologies to navigate roads and operate without the need for a driver. In this essay, we will explore the benefits and challenges of driverless cars, and whether they will ultimately lead to a safer and more efficient transportation system.  One of the main benefits of driverless cars is increased safety. Human error is a leading cause of accidents on the road, and by eliminating the need for a driver, driverless cars can significantly reduce this risk. In addition, driverless cars can communicate with each other and adjust their speed and route to avoid accidents. This technology has the potential to save thousands of lives each year and reduce the number of accidents caused by distracted or impaired drivers.  Another benefit of self-driving cars is increased convenience. With driverless cars, you can relax and enjoy your commute or make productive use of your time while on the road. This technology has the potential to eliminate the need for parking spaces and reduce traffic congestion, as cars can drive closer together and move more efficiently without human intervention.  However, there are also challenges associated with driverless cars, particularly in terms of their cost and reliability. Self-driving cars require advanced technology and software, which can be expensive and may not be accessible to everyone. Additionally, there is the risk of technical glitches or malfunctions, which could lead to unexpected accidents or delays.  There is also the challenge of integrating driverless cars into our existing transportation system. For example, self-driving cars may require new infrastructure, such as charging stations and sensors, which could be expensive and time-consuming to build. There is also the challenge of ensuring that driverless cars are safe and effective in different driving conditions, such as bad weather or construction zones.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to greatly increase safety and convenience, but they also present challenges in terms of cost, reliability, and integration. As this technology continues to evolve, it will be important to consider these factors and ensure that we are taking steps towards a safe and efficient transportation system.		1
The Electoral College is best described as outdated and obsolete. It was designed so that, when there were too many states and poor technology, the vote could be fairly and realistically counted, by voting between a few people from each state. This was good and efficient for that time, but, with the technology available to us today, it is impractical and easy to corrupt. if you live in a mostly Democratic state as a Republican, your vote is regarded as nothing, and you would have no reason to vote in the electoral college, instead of throwing your vote into the entire mass of the united states, where it has a chance to even slightly influence the vote. Also, since larger states are given more attention, due to the allornothing attitude of most states, other states are given less information and are forced to make more wild guesses than votes, a result of having less information.  When the idea of the Electoral College was introduced, the telegraph was still pretty hot technology. All votes would be counted by hand by an impartial court, counting off the vote of every single person individually, out of perhaps more than a million voters. Instead of this, each state would record their own numbers and dispatch a group of electors, who could not be influenced away from their vote, while sending a horseman or a few across the hundreds of miles of U.S. territory with a few little scraps of paper with votes on it would be impractical and dangerous. bags could be lost, a rider could have an accident, entire counties would be unaccounted for. The Electoral College was a nessecity as well as a stroke of genius, and I applaud the man who thought of it. However, this was when the telegraph was a stroke of genius, too. Now we have a cell phone the size of a notepad that can store thousands or millions of votes alone. We have processors that can count the number of people that like apples versus oranges and come out with a percentage, verdict, receipt, and the best bussines option as soon as the numbers are input, as soon as we push that little blue "Enter" button. We can send the votes through the air in the billions, without as much as wires to conduct them. there is little or no possibility of tampering or miscommunication, and there are records to back up and correct every single little error. it is much smarter, safer, and more accurate to initiate a simple counting program on the computer, with each individual terminal sending all of it's results and information to a higher terminal until all of the information is scored, backed up, double checked, counted, percentaged, and a final verdict is reached. This can even be done in a way to run the information separately to different computers, to minimize tampering. The electoral college is obsolete, a small parasite of politicians who just dont want this to end. we dont still use the telegraph, do we?  The electoral college is not only obsolete, unnesessary and parasitic, but also unfair to many voters. The main ways this unfairness can be identified are extreme, and each really deserve a paragraph of their own. Let us imagine a scenario: a democrat lives in a mostly republican state. He goes to vote. His vote is passed along, checked off, and placed aside for a time. When all of the votes are in, the republican votes outweigh the democrats. Now, our democrat's vote, his wife's vote, the democratic guy who works at 711 down the street's vote, Joe's vote, Bob's vote, Billy's vote, "That girl Suzie's" vote and ALL THE DEMOCRATIC VOTES IN THE STATE are all, essentially, thrown into the furnace, and will do so next election, the election after, and essentially every mostly republican election after that. In a popular vote without the barrier of the Electoral College, all those votes would flow into the pile for whichever canidate they voted for. Then the pile would be counted, divided into the total votes, and percentaged. then, at lest the votes could count for SOMETHING, other than a waste of time. But wait! there's more. Most states have an allornothing ideal, meaning if politician A got 51% of the votes in California, while politician B still got 49%, Politician A gets 55 votes in the Electoral College, while politician B gets squat. This does not represent the best interests of many of the people in that state. this is unfair. It also means that larger states have the advantage, because they get more votes, like California 55, Texas 38, and Florida 29, while smaller states get less, such as Alaska 3, Rhode Island 3, and Hawaii 4. Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called "swing states," where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.  In conclusion, the electoral college was the most efficient and sucessful way to vote, back in the 17001800. However, with current communication and transportation technologies, the College has become obsolete, to the point where it should be buried at a crossroads with a stake through it's heart. It is unfair, biased, impractical, and just overall worthless. We should put our newfound technology and knowledge to use and do away with the electoral College, once and for all.		0
 Driverless cars have become increasingly popular in recent years, as technology continues to evolve and improve. There are many benefits to driverless cars, including increased safety, lowered environmental impact, and increased efficiency. However, there are also some concerns and challenges associated with the widespread adoption of driverless cars. In this essay, we will explore both the advantages and disadvantages of driverless cars.  One of the biggest advantages of driverless cars is the potential for increased safety. Automated driving systems can help prevent accidents caused by human error, such as drunk driving, reckless driving, or distracted driving. In addition, the use of driverless cars can help eliminate the need for human drivers to work in high-risk environments, such as construction zones or emergency response situations. This can help reduce the risk of injury and death for these workers.  Another advantage of driverless cars is the potential to lower their environmental impact. Autonomous driving systems can be designed to optimize fuel efficiency and reduce emissions, which can help reduce the overall carbon footprint of transportation. In addition, driverless cars can help reduce the number of cars on the road, as they can be used more efficiently and effectively. This can help reduce congestion and decrease the overall demand for parking, which in turn can lead to reduced urban sprawl and more sustainable land use patterns.  Despite these benefits, there are also concerns and challenges associated with the widespread adoption of driverless cars. One of the biggest concerns is the cost of developing and implementing these systems. Although advances in technology have made it increasingly possible to develop autonomous driving systems, the cost of developing and testing these systems can be significant. This can make it difficult for smaller and less profitable automakers to enter the market, which can lead to consolidation in the industry and reduced competition.  Another concern is the potential for job loss due to the widespread adoption of driverless cars. While the use of driverless cars can help reduce the risk of injury and death for drivers, it can also lead to the displacement of many jobs in the transportation sector. This can have a significant impact on the economy, particularly in areas where transportation is a major industry. It is important for policymakers to consider the potential for job loss and to develop strategies to help workers transition to new careers.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to bring many benefits, including increased safety, reduced environmental impact, and increased efficiency. However, there are also challenges and concerns associated with their widespread adoption, including the cost of development and the potential for job loss. It is important for policymakers to carefully consider these issues and to develop strategies that balance the benefits and risks of driverless cars.		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote. I know that this is a controversial issue, but I believe that it is the right thing to do.  The Electoral College is an outdated system that no longer reflects the will of the people. In the past, it was necessary to have a system in which each state had a certain number of electors, but this is no longer the case. Today, we have a national popular vote, and the person who wins the popular vote should be the president.  There are many reasons why the Electoral College is unfair. First, it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. When this happens, it means that the majority of voters have been ignored.  Second, the Electoral College gives more power to small states than it does to large states. This is because each state has a minimum of three electors, regardless of its population. This means that a vote in a small state is worth more than a vote in a large state.  Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on a few swing states and ignore the rest of the country. This is because the candidates only need to win the popular vote in a few states in order to win the election. This means that many voters feel like their votes don't matter.  I believe that the best way to fix this system is to abolish the Electoral College and elect the president by popular vote. This would ensure that the person who wins the election is the person who the majority of the people want. It would also give all voters an equal voice in the election.  I urge you to support this important reform. Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  Your Name		1
 Facial action coding system is a relatively new technology that enables computers to recognize and interpret human facial expressions. The system can be used to analyze various aspects of facial expressions, such as emotions, facial movements, and even muscle activation. In this essay, we will explore the concept of facial action coding system, its benefits, and potential applications.  One of the primary benefits of facial action coding system is its ability to accurately identify emotions and facial expressions. By analyzing specific muscle movements and facial features, the system can identify the emotion being expressed with a high degree of accuracy. This can be used in various fields, such as psychology, marketing, and even law enforcement, to provide insights into people's emotions and intentions.  Another important aspect of facial action coding system is its ability to track facial movements in real-time. This can be useful in analyzing micro-expressions or subtle changes in facial expressions that may indicate a change in emotional state. For example, a person may try to hide their emotions, but the facial action coding system may still detect tiny changes in facial movements that reveal their true feelings.  In the field of marketing, facial action coding system can be used to understand how people respond to different advertisements and products. By analyzing facial expressions and muscle activation, the system can provide insights into what works and what doesn't, helping companies to develop more effective marketing campaigns.  Facial action coding system can also be used in law enforcement to help identify individuals who may be involved in criminal activities. By analyzing facial expressions and other body language cues, the system can help detectives identify suspects more quickly and accurately.  In conclusion, facial action coding system is an exciting and rapidly evolving technology that has a wide range of applications. Its ability to accurately identify emotions and facial expressions, track facial movements in real-time, and provide insights into people's intentions makes it a valuable tool in various fields. As technology continues to improve, we can expect to see even more innovative uses for facial action coding system in the future.		1
[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP] [Email Address] [Phone Number] [Date]  [Senator's Name] [Senator's Address] [City, State, ZIP]  Dear Senator [Senator’s Last Name],  I am writing to express my position on the issue of the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the reasons for both keeping it and transitioning to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that it is important to explore the advantages and disadvantages of each system in order to make an informed decision.  The Electoral College, as defined by the Office of the Federal Register, was established as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. The electors are chosen by the candidate's political party, and most states have a "winner-take-all" system, awarding all electors to the winning presidential candidate.  Proponents of the Electoral College, such as Judge Richard A. Posner, argue that it provides certainty of outcome by giving the winning candidate a larger share of the electoral vote than their share of the popular vote. This system reduces the likelihood of a dispute over the outcome and minimizes the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.  Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal, as stated by Judge Posner. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, so candidates are incentivized to campaign in different regions. This requirement promotes a president who will represent the interests of all regions and prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from winning.  Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on "toss-up" states, which, according to Judge Posner, are likely to be the most thoughtful voters. These voters pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions based on the available information.  Moreover, the Electoral College restores balance to the political influence of large and small states. Judge Posner argues that the mal-apportionment of the Senate gives large states less weight in the political balance. The Electoral College brings attention to large states during the campaign and ensures that their votes have a greater impact.  Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the problem of run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. This is beneficial as it reduces the complexity of the presidential election process and ensures a clear winner.  On the other hand, critics of the Electoral College, like Bradford Plumer, argue that it is unfair to voters due to the winner-take-all system. They contend that candidates focus only on swing states, neglecting others. Plumer asserts that this system places the fate of the presidency in the hands of a small number of swing voters and does not represent the interests of all American citizens.  While both sides provide compelling arguments, it is crucial to consider the practical implications of each system. The Electoral College has proven to be a reliable and effective method of electing the President, and it offers important advantages such as certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, balance between large and small states, and avoidance of run-off elections.  However, I believe that there should also be further examination and discussion on the issue, taking into account the concerns raised by the critics of the Electoral College. It is essential to find a solution that ensures every American citizen has their voice heard and that the President represents the interests of all regions and states.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the information provided from multiple sources in order to make an informed decision on the future of the Electoral College.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Limiting car usage would be great for both you and the environment. If we didn't use cars as much, we would get more exercise, save more money, and limit the amount of air pollution we produce. We would start to notice changes for the better in our health, our budgeting, and the condition of the environment. I have gathered evidence from a few different sources to back up these claims. "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars", "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Botogta", and "The End of Car Culture" all go into detail about the benefits that did happen or could happen while we limit car usage.  One advantage of limiting car usage is the increase in exercise it will give you. Did you know that 70% of America is overweight? An advantage to walking or biking places that driving doesn't have is that walking or biking will get you active. It will help you burn calories and it will give you the self-confidence of being in good shape. Sure, it might be hot out when you walk or bike places, but this problem can be solved by simply dressing appropriotely for the activity. Wear something that you know you'll be comfortable getting excercise in. One business man riding a two seat bicycle with his wife (instead of driving), said, "It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution", (Source 3). Walking or riding your bike to get places rather than driving to them will give you more time to think. If you think too much on the road, something dangerous is bound to happen. Walking to places is a great alternative to driving not only for your body but for your mind, and this, to me, is a strong advantage of limiting car usage.  Another advantage to limiting car usage is you will start to save money. Gas bills start to add up, especially considering the constant inclination of prices. Not only gas, though, but other costly needs such as getting your car's oil changed or tires replaced can also turn out to be expensive. Cost plays a huge role in whether or not teens and young adults will get a car when legally eligable. "There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license", (Source 4). A large amount of teens just now getting their licenses are unemployed, making the car expenses impossible for them to pay on their own, making them rely on usually a parent or relative. Money has always had a significant effect on how people transport from one place to another. Limiting driving all together would save you gas and repair money, and saving money could never be a bad thing.  Finally, a significant advantage of not driving as much is that it would limit the amount of air pollution on this earth. "...a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe", (Source 1). Though we may not notice it, air pollution is constantly contaminating the earth. Air pollution is extremely harmful to inhale, almost like how smoking is extremely bad for your lungs. Reducing the amount of driving that we do would reduce the amount of air pollution we produce with it. Walking or biking does not pollute the earth the way driving can.  Advantages of limiting car usage are not only good for the environment but are good for us both physically, mentally, and financially. If everyone started to limit the amount of time they spend driving per day, just imagine the change we might start to see in the community. We could start by walking to the grocery store or our friends' houses instead of driving, and then maybe bring on a long-term change, such as walking to school if it's close enough, or walking to the bus stop so you can ride the bus with other kids instead of driving your own car, creating more air pollution. There are other advantages to limiting car usage, but these are the top three advantages we will begin to notice if we act soon enough.    		0
Dear Principal,  I am writing you on behalf of the community service issue, I think that you should not require students to do community services. Although community services are a good thin, some children to not have time for them. Say, for instance, you are a kid who plays many sports, you have a sport after school, and then another one after that. You wouldn't have time to do any community service, and when you do, you always get interrupted. The student might have games on the weekends, and practices on the week days. They may want to do community service, but just don't have the time.  On the other hand, there are kids that don't play any sports and have little, to no, responsibilities. They can do community service if they want to, you can never force a person to do something that they don't want to do. Those kids that want to do it, can go ahead, but i think you shouldn't make others that don't want to have to do it. There are many choices of things to do for community service. Some examples are : work at a child's hospital, or go to the local park and pick up trash. If everybody in the United States picked up at least one piece of trash a day, the world would be a way better place.  I personally, would not have much time for community service, but the time that i did have I would use. Over the summer, I normally volunteer at the local hospital. I work with children. Even if you don't have a lot of time, you can still get a lot accomplished. The little time you have, can make a world of a difference. There are some kids at hospital, that are neglected by there parents because of there illness. They want anybody to play with and they get emotionally attached very quickly.  I think kids should be responsible to making there own decision. You should offer community service jobs, but not make them a requirement. Offer ones that are local, and may sound appeal to  Kids my age. Like if you were to say that there were jobs at the mall, Ther mids would be saying "reason to. Post adds around the school, implying that you recommend that particular job.  The kids that do a certain amount of hours, should be rewarded, that can be in any way. Whether that is bye giving them candy, or giving them responsibility passes. Yes, some kids would happily do community service for fun, but don't have the time. Other kids might have all the time in the world, and not want to.  I think that it would be in the better good for all the students. Although some may be rude and turn it down, remember that it is for a reason, and you don't know what that reason is.  I hope you take in everything that i have said.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
If schools allowed your child to be taught at home, it will improve their ability to be more focused, more self-disciplined, and more independent about leaning their curriculum. The student will feel more relaxed in their adjustable environment. There wont be any distractions that may occur in a typical school class. A handful of students would feel more safe being around at an everyday house. If the school allowed the children to learn at home, it would not just benefit that single child, but it will benefit the most of the school workers and the parents safety about their child.  The students would feel more satisfied being isolated at there safe house. Attending class form home would allow you to adjust your surroundings to make the student feel more comfortable rather than having school adjust the environment for their standards. People that are shy, such as myself, would prefer to attend class at home rather than go out to school where tons of kids attend to. However, shy people should go to school to help them improve their social skills, and be more outgoing. All students would be more comfortable attending class at home, but people that are shy would not improve their social skills.  Students tend to get distracted easily in class, that disrupts the flow and rhythm of the class. These classes often get off task from students that are trying to make the class more enjoyable, by being the class clown; the class clown usually makes jokes that will lead the entire class laughing, even the teacher may have a laugh, which ends up taking time away from the traditional class. If the children do attend class form home, the parents or guardian may monitor there behavior during the child class expiereance. Consequently if the children arent being monitored they could easily get distracted by doing anything they want like playing video games or even fall asleep in the middle of a lesson. The children being ignored may have a tough time staying on topic, while the children being monitored will highly stay focused on their lesson instead of being distracted from anything.  The children would feel more safe being isolated in their bedrooms rather than going on an unpredictable adventure to school. From the past few years, school shootings are happening more often, these shootings mostly involve mentally ill kids. One most know shooting was the "Columbine school shooting," the crime involved two kids that were getting bullied throughout their school years to cause this; bullying should be a topic to discuss with kids, but it may seem as a difficult topic to discuss with children, as they will feel left out from their peers. If they attend class form home they could avoid being bullied and feel more safe being at their protected house; the problem is that the children acting as the bully,often has a problem at home that makes them take their frustrations out on other people. Many children would benefit learning at home, while several children may have family problems that disrupt their safety needs.  The benefits of attending class from home would not just benefit the student, but also the people that care about him. The students would gain more freedom and confidence, while attending class at home. The students would not be able to distract each other from learning, but may make the class seem more boring than usual. The safety of the students would be chosen by their parents actions instead of the schools actions. Overall the benefits of attending class from home, out ways the benefits of attending class from school.      		0
Cell phones have become integral elements of modern life, so it is no surprise that their use in the classroom has been receiving much attention. Many schools and universities have varying policies surrounding the use of cell phones in learning environments, ranging from complete bans to learning scenarios that include cell phone use. Arguments for and against the use of cell phones in the classroom can be found on both sides of the discussion.   Positively, cell phones can offer many benefits to the learning process, enabling students to access information quickly and easily. Additionally, text messaging, email, and other online communication tools can facilitate collaboration and communication between students and teachers. Smart phones are also able to capture photos and videos that students can use for research projects.  On the other hand, cell phone use in the classroom has shown to be distracting to both students and teachers. Cellphones can be used to cheat on tests, watch videos, or send messages if not monitored properly. Additionally, too much reliance on cell phones can lead to students not learning the material in-depth.   Overall, the effects of cell phone use in the classroom will depend heavily on the policies and administration monitoring their use. The benefits of technology must be balanced with the possible negative impacts to ensure a safe and productive learning environment.		1
To my principal:  Community service is a great part of life that I think every one should have experienced, but I do not think that it is appropriate to have community service as a required task. I believe that if someone were to make you do community service it wouldn't be the same as you doing it out of your will. If it was a required performance then it wouldn't be the same because you don't really intend to help, you would just rather get it over with. It wouldn't have the same effect if you were having to perform community service against your will rather than doing it out of your will.  Yes, community service is outstanding but try putting yourself in our shoes. How would you schedule a date for community service when students like us our loaded with homework every week day and if our weekends is our time to take it easy.  A perfect experience was when I went to a church camp, D-Now, and we had the task of picking up litter from a local park. I enjoyed it but I really didn't feel like I had done anything because I had to do so.  Here's my ideal about community service: I think it would be remarkable if we could have one day of the year to clean up our neighborhoods and even go farther than just picking up trash. We, and I mean everyone in the U.S., should clean the streets of our city, and also feed the hungry because it is COMMUNITY service and no one deserves to go hungry. But then again that's just my opinion.  I hope every man, woman, and child will have the opportunity to take part in community service, not being forced to but actually wanting to do it.  Thank You, mr. Principal for taking the time to read these few lines but I hop		0
Dear Principal,  I am writing to express my view that students should be required to perform a moderate amount of community service. There are several important reasons why this is beneficial both for students and the community.   Firstly, volunteering teaches young people valuable life lessons and skills. When students tutor others or help clean public areas, they learn accountability, cooperation, problem-solving and empathy - qualities that will serve them well beyond school. Community service also allows students to explore different career interests and develop practical skills. For many, it is a first introduction to civic engagement and social responsibility.  Secondly, the community greatly benefits from student involvement. Many essential services and programs rely heavily on volunteers. By assisting groups like libraries, homeless shelters or parks departments, students directly improve people's lives through needed services like literacy support, meal delivery or beautification projects. This type of hands-on learning and giving back fosters a ethic of citizenship from a young age.  Of course, some free time is important for study, family and personal pursuits. However, a modest community service requirement, say 10-20 hours per year, would not overly burden students' schedules. Many service opportunities are also arranged so they do not significantly cut into academic or extracurricular time. With plenty of flexible options available, every student should be able to complete their hours through an activity that interests them.   In conclusion, community service is a win-win for both students and society. The skills and perspective gained will benefit young people far beyond their school years. At the same time, local nonprofit and public programs are strengthened. A requirement would encourage participation from all students, instilling a sense of social responsibility that will last a lifetime. For these reasons, I support a reasonable community service mandate for all grade levels.  Thank you for considering my opinion. Please let me know if you need any other information from me.  Sincerely, [Your name]		1
Technology is proving fast. People have many different new ways to get education. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes by way of online or video conferencing. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they will get distract, have questions that can not be solve, and learn nothing without internet.  Student will get distract from learning at home. Some student have self control to learn, but most don't. They may doing another thing while learning, or fall in to a sleep. Student can play video game and the teacher will not notice. For example, kids are the fast learner on computers. My brother who is in second grade, he's English class is taking online. During the lesson, he open up another window to play game. He divide the screen into two small screen, so one side is English class and the another one is the game that he like to play, and teacher do not notice that. Technology is a simple way to get education, but also is the way how students can "cheat".  Student may have question during the online class that can't get solve. Not anything online can give you an answer. My geometry teacher was absent on one day, and she made a video of the lesson we missed. During the video, I have a lot question, I tried to find them online, but I find nothing. I couldn't solve the question until I see her again. There is a lot simpler to learn in class because teacher will give you example to help you understand the question and give some practice of it, this way you can really learn and understand the lesson. Online class is just give you a lesson, when you have a question, you have no one to ask and no where to get help.  Online class will not work without internet. Some places have problem on internet, if that happen, student will not learn anything. My friend Generic_Name, who live in a town, has very bad internet at home, sometime the internet is completely dead. She have to take the classes online, but without internet, she couldn't do anything. That day she was so angry because she learned nothing, and she don't have a second option to get education. Therefore, online class is not benefit to everybody.  Some may say students would benefit from attend classes from home because they will get enough rest; however, they would not learn anything. Learning at school will let students be more success and helpful. School can develops many talent students by working together with teachers. Attend classes is the only and the best way that people get education because student will be more concentrate, understand everything they learn, and get education in many ways.		0

**The Challenge of Exploring Venus**  In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author provides several reasons why studying Venus is important, including the fact that it is our closest neighbor planet and that it can tell us a lot about the history of our solar system. However, the author also acknowledges that there are many dangers involved in studying Venus, including the planet's extreme heat and pressure.  In my opinion, the author does a good job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. The author provides a lot of evidence to support the claim that Venus is an important planet to study, and the author also acknowledges the dangers involved in studying Venus. However, the author's arguments are underdeveloped and lack clear examples. For example, the author states that studying Venus can tell us a lot about the history of our solar system, but the author does not provide any specific examples of what we can learn from studying Venus. Additionally, the author's discussion of the dangers of studying Venus is brief and does not provide much detail.  Overall, I think the author does a good job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, but the arguments are underdeveloped and lack clear examples.  **Introduction**  Venus is our closest neighbor planet, and it is also one of the most inhospitable places in the solar system. The surface of Venus is covered in thick clouds of sulfuric acid, and the temperature at the surface is hot enough to melt lead. However, despite the dangers, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it can tell us a lot about the history of our solar system and the evolution of life.  **Body**  One of the reasons why studying Venus is important is because it can tell us a lot about the early history of our solar system. Venus is thought to be about the same age as Earth, and it is believed that both planets formed from the same material. However, Venus has evolved very differently from Earth. This is likely due to the fact that Venus has a much thicker atmosphere than Earth, which traps heat and prevents the planet from cooling down.  By studying Venus, we can learn more about the factors that influenced the early evolution of our solar system. We can also learn more about the conditions that are necessary for life to exist. If we can understand why Venus evolved so differently from Earth, we may be able to better understand why life evolved on Earth.  Another reason why studying Venus is important is because it can tell us more about the evolution of life. Venus is thought to have had a much more hospitable environment in the past. The planet may have had liquid water on its surface, and the atmosphere may have been thinner. This would have made Venus a more likely place for life to evolve.  By studying Venus, we can learn more about the conditions that are necessary for life to exist. We can also learn more about the early evolution of life on Earth. If we can understand how life evolved on Earth, we may be able to better understand the possibility of life on other planets, including Venus.  **Conclusion**  Despite the dangers, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it can tell us a lot about the history of our solar system and the evolution of life. By studying Venus, we can learn more about the factors that influenced the early evolution of our solar system, and we can learn more about the conditions that are necessary for life to exist.		1
Finding out who you are and what your purpose is in life is a journey that requires self-reflection and exploration. There are different perspectives that can help you discover your true self and your purpose, including family, friends, society, and your own inner voice. However, being yourself in a world that can be hostile and unsupportive can be challenging. In this essay, I will brainstorm ways to find out who you are and what your purpose is in life, and make a plan for how you will strive to remain true to yourself in spite of it all.  One way to discover your true self is by listening to your family and friends. They may have insights and perspectives that can help you understand your strengths, weaknesses, and values. They may also be able to provide support and encouragement as you navigate your journey of self-discovery. However, it's important to remember that their opinions may not always align with your own, and it's important to trust your own instincts and beliefs.  Another way to discover your true self is by exploring society and the world around you. Observing the people around you, their behaviors, and their beliefs can help you understand what you value and what you don't. It can also help you identify your strengths and weaknesses, as well as your areas for improvement. However, it's important to remember that society can be a double-edged sword, and it's important to be critical of the messages and values that are being promoted.  Your own inner voice is also an important source of guidance and self-discovery. It's important to listen to your intuition and your emotions, as they can provide insights and perspectives that may not be immediately apparent. However, it's also important to be mindful of your thoughts and beliefs, as they can be influenced by external factors such as media and popular culture.  Being yourself in a world that can be hostile and unsupportive can be challenging. It's important to be aware of the potential risks and challenges, and to have a plan in place to navigate them. One way to do this is by building a support system of friends, family, and mentors who can provide encouragement and guidance. It's also important to be resilient and to have a growth mindset, as setbacks and challenges are inevitable.  In conclusion, discover		1
 The Old West has long been romanticized as a time of rugged individualism and adventure. The cowboy embodies this era of American history, characterized by his iconic outfit, his trusty horse, and his rough-and-tumble way of life. However, cowboys weren't just roughnecks; they were skilled riders who navigated treacherous terrains and faced dangerous creatures. One of the most impressive cowboys was one who rode the waves  C a cowboy with an unusual love of the ocean.  Born in Texas, this cowboy learned to ride horses as a child. He spent his first years herding cattle across the vast, rugged landscapes of America's West, honing his skills as a rider. But the love of the ocean was in his blood, and he always knew that someday he would trade in his six-shooter for a paddle.  One day, after years of hard work and saving, he set out for the coast. He had heard tales of great waves, of surfers who rode the waves with the precision and grace of dancers. He was determined to learn this new skill and to become a master of the ocean.  His first foray into surfing was a challenge, to say the least. The waves were fierce, and the ocean was a vast and unpredictable beast. But the cowboy was determined. He spent months aboard a small wooden surfboard, watching and learning from the locals, working tirelessly to improve his technique.  Slowly but surely, he began to make progress. He learned to ride the waves with precision, to turn and slide with the grace of a ballroom dancer, and to surf with a fearsome determination. Before he knew it, he was one of the most respected surfers on the coast.  One day, while out at sea, he encountered a shark. It was terrifying, with jaws snapping and teeth tearing. But the cowboy remained calm, keeping his surfboard between himself and the monster. With a burst of energy and skill, he dove through the water, spinning and twisting in the air to avoid the shark's grasp.  The shark eventually took off, but the cowboy had proven his mettle. He was a true champion  C a cowboy who could ride the waves with the best of them. From that day on, he became known as the ocean cowboy, a legendary figure respected by surfers and non-surfers alike.  The cowboy who rode the waves is more than just a hero; he is a symbol of the human spirit. His journey from land to sea shows how our thirst for adventure can drive us to overcome challenges and achieve great things. It also points to the idea that we should never stop learning and growing, whether we are out on the open range or out in the ocean.  In conclusion, the cowboy who rode the waves is a living embodiment of the spirit of adventure and the pursuit of excellence. His skill, determination, and courage are truly inspiring, and serve as a reminder that anything is possible with hard work and dedication. Whether you're a cowboy on horseback or a surfer in the ocean, never let your passion for adventure and life drive you to achieve your dreams.		1

These traits help individuals to stay motivated and focused, develop resilience, and develop discipline and self-control. By cultivating these traits, individuals can achieve their goals and become more successful in all areas of their lives.		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.  The Electoral College is an outdated system that is no longer representative of the American people. In the past, the College was created to give more power to smaller states, but today, it gives disproportionate power to a few swing states. This means that the majority of Americans can be ignored by presidential candidates who focus their attention on winning over voters in just a handful of states.  The Electoral College also leads to voter suppression. In states with a winner-take-all system, voters in the losing party feel like their votes don't matter. This is especially true in states that are always won by the same party.  Finally, the Electoral College can lead to a president who does not win the popular vote. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. When a president is not elected by the majority of voters, it undermines our democracy and erodes public confidence in our government.  I urge you to support a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote. This would be a simple and fair way to ensure that the President of the United States is chosen by the majority of the American people.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
 The article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" discusses how the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, is a newly developed technology that can help computers identify human emotions. This technology is valuable for many reasons, one of which is that it can be used to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. This can help teachers to better understand their students and to tailor their teaching methods to their individual needs.   For example, if a teacher notices that a student often seems confused or frustrated, they may be able to use this information to adjust their teaching methods or provide additional support to the student. This can help to create a more positive and productive learning environment for all of the students.  In addition, FACS can also be used to measure the effectiveness of different teaching methods or strategies. For example, if a teacher uses a new teaching method and notices that students seem more engaged and interested in the material, they may be able to conclude that the new method was successful. This can help teachers to continuously improve their teaching methods and provide the best possible education for their students.  Overall, the use of FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom can be a valuable tool for teachers and can help to create a more positive and productive learning environment. It can also be used to measure the effectiveness of different teaching methods or strategies, helping teachers to continuously improve their teaching methods and provide the best possible education for their students.   However, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of this technology. For example, if a teacher were to use FACS to judge a student's emotional state without their consent, this could violate the student's privacy and trust. This technology should be used with caution and only with the consent of all parties involved.   In conclusion, the use of FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom can be valuable for teachers and can help to create a more positive and productive learning environment. However, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of this technology and to use it with caution and consent.   As a high school student, I believe that FACS can be a valuable tool for teachers and can help to create a more positive and productive learning environment. However, I also believe that it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of this technology and to use it with caution and consent. Students must be made aware of how this technology is being used to read their emotional expressions, and should have the option to opt-out of this technology should they wish to do so.   Note that this is a fictional essay and makes several claims that are incorrect regarding FACS and its uses in an academic setting.		1
  As citizens of our community, reducing car use is essential to improving air quality, reducing traffic congestion, and preserving the environment. By basing our argument on the passages provided and addressing potential counterarguments, we can effectively communicate the importance of limiting car usage.  Claim: Limiting car use can significantly improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and benefit the environment.  Passage 1 explains that "Car-Free Cities" like Vauban in Germany have improved air quality by banning cars and promoting alternative modes of transportation. This is significant because air pollution caused by car emissions is a major health concern, particularly for children, older adults, and people with respiratory conditions. By limiting car use, we can reduce the amount of harmful pollutants in the air, making our community a healthier place to live.  Passage 2 highlights the impact of car use on traffic congestion in Paris, where the city enforced a partial driving ban to reduce smog. The passage notes that "Congestion3 was down 60 percent in the capital of France" after five days of implementing the ban. This reduction in congestion leads to a more efficient use of time and resources, as people can travel faster and more reliably without the need for cars.  Passage 3 discusses the benefits of a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people walked, biked, or used public transportation instead of driving to work. The passage notes that "the turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota." This event shows that there are viable alternatives to driving, and that people are willing to adopt these alternatives when given the opportunity.  Counterclaim: Some may argue that limiting car use is impractical or impossible, particularly in areas with limited public transportation		1
Working on school work alone or with a group can be beneficial. Working alone can provide a high level of concentration since you are not being distracted by others. It can also help foster independence, as it encourages the student to take responsibility for their own studies and investments in learning. On the other hand, working in a group can also provide many benefits. Groups can bring together multiple diverse perspectives and ideas that can create a richer understanding of a particular topic. Additionally, working in a group can provide social support and motivation, encouraging the student to be an active participant in the learning process. Each option has its advantages and disadvantages, but ultimately, successful school work can often depend on the individual student and their method of studying best.		1
 The face on Mars has long captivated scientists and amateur astronomers alike. In recent years, NASA's rovers have captured high-resolution images that have brought the mysterious face into focus, sparking renewed debate about the planet's potential for life.  One of the most famous faces on Mars is the "Solaris Syriacus" crater, also known as the "Father of Craters." This crater is over 500 kilometers wide and is believed to be between 3.8 and 4.1 billion years old. Its features, including its wavy ridges and grooves, give it a human-like face, with a wide smile stretching across the center.  Another well-known face on Mars is the "Cerebus" crater, which is about 9 kilometers wide and 4 kilometers deep. Its dark, rocky appearance is reminiscent of a mountain range, while its elongated shape resembles a human nose.  Some scientists believe that these faces on Mars could be signs of past life on the planet. Others suggest that they may have formed from the planet's volcanic activity or other geological processes. However, no definitive evidence has been found to support either theory.  Despite the ongoing debate, the faces on Mars continue to fascinate people around the world. They serve as a reminder of the mysteries and wonders of our neighboring planet, and as a testament to the incredible advances in technology and exploration that have made it possible to capture such detailed images from billions of miles away.  In conclusion, the faces on Mars are an enigma that continue to capture our imaginations. Whether they are signs of past life on the planet or simply results of geological processes, they serve as a reminder of the infinite mysteries that surround us in the universe. As scientific technology continues to advance, we can only hope that one day we will uncover the secrets of these fascinating features and gain a greater understanding of the potential for life on Mars.		1
The Electoral College, to begin with, is the electoral voting of the President and Vice President. In the articles "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer and "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President" by Richard A. Posner, both articles argue on the subject of if the Electoral College should be kept or if the election should be changed to popular vote.  Although it is true, according to the article by Richard A. Posner, that larger states get the majority of attention when it comes to votes, it is still possible that regardless that the legislatures choose the electors, the electors may "defy the will of the people", according to the article by Bradford Plumer. It is stated that electors have declined the voting of their party's candidate and went on to "vote for whomever they please...." Furthermore, in the article by Bradford Plumer, Plumer states, "the electoral college is unfair to voters." In other words, the popular vote basically gets no say in who they are choosing for presidential candidate, only who gets to choose the candidate. Even as stated in the opposing article by Richard A. Posner, Posner states, "the electoral will not win the national popular vote." This is stating that basically the popular vote is powerless in voting for a presidential candidate.  Moreover, Posner explains in his article, "The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast." However this has happened before where there has been more of a "tie," Plumer backs this up quoting that "In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president." In short, if the Electoral College fails, they have Mommy and Daddy to back them up. In this case, the simpler route would be to have the election dependent upon popular vote.  In conclusion, it would appear as the electoral college is "unfair, outdated, and irrational." This goes to prove the electoral college has no place in deciding our votes for us.		0
Essay:  Limiting Car Usage: A Step Towards a Sustainable Future  In today's world, it is becoming increasingly important to find alternative ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat the adverse effects of climate change. One such solution that is gaining traction is the limitation of car usage. This idea is not only being implemented in cities around the world but is also gaining the support of citizens who are realizing the numerous advantages of living without cars.  One prime example of a car-free community is Vauban, Germany. Residents of this experimental district have made the conscious decision to give up their cars. Streets are completely car-free, with the exception of the main thoroughfare for public transportation. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move into this eco-friendly neighborhood (Rosenthal). The residents of Vauban have reported a higher level of happiness and a reduction in stress since giving up their cars. This highlights the psychological benefits of reducing car usage and relying on alternative forms of transportation.  The impact of car usage on greenhouse gas emissions cannot be understated. Passenger cars alone are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some heavily car-dependent areas in the United States (Rosenthal). By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and move towards a more sustainable future. This shift is crucial in mitigating climate change and its devastating effects.  Furthermore, limiting car usage can also improve the health of our cities. The smog problem faced by cities like Paris has forced them to enforce partial driving bans in order to clear the air. During these bans, congestion in Paris decreased by 60 percent and the city's smog levels were comparable to heavily polluted cities like Beijing (Duffer). These measures not only improve air quality but also make cities more livable by reducing traffic congestion and noise pollution.  In addition to the environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can also revitalize urban areas and create more accessible communities. Suburban development has traditionally been centered around cars, with wide roads and large parking areas. This model is slowly changing as cities adopt smart planning principles. Communities like Vauban are placing stores within walking distance of homes, making it easier for residents to get their daily needs without depending on cars. This kind of compact and accessible urban development can relieve pressure on city infrastructure and promote walkability (Rosenthal).  It is important to note that efforts to limit car usage are not limited to Europe. Bogota, Colombia has implemented a car-free day, where millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation to work. As a result, the streets of Bogota are temporarily free of traffic jams, and alternative transportation methods are promoted (Selsky). This initiative demonstrates that limiting car usage is not only feasible but also scalable to other cities around the world.  While it is important to acknowledge the potential negative implications for the car industry, it is necessary to adapt to the changing cultural shift towards alternative forms of transportation. Car manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves as mobility companies, recognizing the need to diversify their offerings beyond personal vehicles (Rosenthal). This shift in the market presents an opportunity for the development of innovative transportation solutions that meet the needs of a changing society.  In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that go beyond reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It improves happiness and reduces stress for individuals, improves air quality and health in cities, revitalizes urban areas, and promotes accessibility and walkability. As more cities and communities around the world embrace this shift towards car-reduced living, it is crucial for individuals and policymakers to support and implement initiatives that limit car usage. By doing so, we can create a more sustainable and livable future for ourselves and future generations.		1
The car has become a staple of American life. It is a status symbol, a way to get around, and a source of entertainment. However, there are many advantages to limiting our car usage.  First, car usage is a major contributor to pollution. Cars emit greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. They also emit air pollutants, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. Limiting our car usage can help to reduce pollution and improve air quality.  Second, car usage is a major contributor to traffic congestion. Traffic congestion wastes time and fuel. It also increases stress levels and contributes to air pollution. Limiting our car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion and make our roads safer and more efficient.  Third, car usage is a major contributor to urban sprawl. As people move further and further out from city centers, they become increasingly reliant on cars to get around. This can lead to the development of low-density, car-dependent suburbs. Limiting our car usage can help to promote more compact, walkable, and sustainable communities.  Fourth, car usage can be expensive. The cost of owning and operating a car can be a major financial burden. This is especially true for people who live in urban areas, where parking and gas are expensive. Limiting our car usage can help to save money and improve our financial security.  Fifth, car usage can be dangerous. Cars are involved in millions of accidents each year. These accidents can result in serious injuries and death. Limiting our car usage can help to reduce our risk of being involved in an accident.  In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting our car usage. Car usage is a major contributor to pollution, traffic congestion, urban sprawl, and financial costs. It is also dangerous. By limiting our car usage, we can help to improve our environment, our communities, and our safety.  There are many ways to limit our car usage. We can walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving. We can carpool or rideshare when we need to travel long distances. We can also telecommute or work from home, which can eliminate the need to drive to work altogether.  Limiting our car usage can be a challenge, but it is worth it. By making small changes in our daily lives, we can make a big difference for our planet and our future.		1
 The electoral college is a fundamental part of the United States' presidential election process. However, the effectiveness and fairness of this system has been called into question by many over the years. I believe that the electoral college works to some extent, but not without its flaws.  One of the main advantages of the electoral college is that it allows for a balance between urban and rural areas in the electoral outcome. Rural areas typically have a smaller population than urban areas, and without the electoral college, urban areas could have too much influence on the election results. This could potentially lead to a situation where one party dominates all of a particular area, and that area's political preferences become the majority.  Additionally, the electoral college provides a clear incentive for politicians to focus on key swing states, which could lead to a more balanced electoral map. This incentive is created by the fact that many swing states are crucial to a candidate's success, as they have a large number of electoral votes. This could potentially lead to a more balanced representation of different regions and interest groups in the election.  However, despite these advantages, there are also several disadvantages to the electoral college system. One major disadvantage is that it can lead to a situation where the candidate with the most votes in the popular vote does not win the election. This scenario occurred during the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections, where the candidate who won the presidential election did not win the popular vote, but instead won the electoral vote.  Another disadvantage of the electoral college is that it can lead to a situation where a candidate ignores certain groups of voters, such as the youth or minorities, who may not be as influential in swing states. This could potentially lead to a situation where certain communities feel ignored or unrepresented in the election process.  In conclusion, while the electoral college has its advantages, it also has its limitations. In order to ensure that the electoral college remains effective and fair, it is essential that certain reforms are made, such as a national popular vote. This could potentially prevent situations where the candidate with the most votes in the popular vote does not win the election, and it would lead to greater representation of all voter groups in the election process. Ultimately, the continued effectiveness of the electoral college system depends on its ability to adapt to new challenges and ensure that all voters have a voice in the election process.		1
 The question of whether individuals should make their own decisions or seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters is a complex one, and opinions on the matter vary widely. In my view, the answer depends on the specific situation at hand.  On one hand, making one's own decisions can be empowering and allow individuals to take control of their lives. When I was younger, I always wanted to make my own decisions and not have to listen to anyone else's advice. This independence has served me well throughout my life, as I have learned valuable lessons from my decisions and have become more confident in my abilities.  However, as I have grown older, I have come to realize that sometimes the advice of others can be invaluable. There have been times when I have made decisions that turned out to be less than ideal, but by seeking the guidance of experts and authorities, I have been able to learn from my mistakes and make better decisions in the future. Additionally, listening to the advice of those who have more experience and knowledge can be a humbling experience and can help individuals grow and develop.  In conclusion, while making one's own decisions can be empowering, it is important to also seek guidance from experts and authorities when appropriate. By doing so, individuals can learn from their mistakes and make better decisions in the future, while also benefiting from the wisdom and experience of those around them.		1
In the article usage of FACS is shown by telling us The Mona Lisa's true emotions after using the program. I believe that the technology used can be important in schools and classrooms to show wether students are bored, sad, or angry. This technology can be used to help students with different emotions learn lessons better. The technology can also help teachers further understand how a student's emotions affects their learning.  When the program gets implemented into schools it may actually help students learn better. In the text it is explained that "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal", meaning that it can be used on almost any one. This would make it easier to use the program in other areas and different kinds of people.  In conclusion I believe the use of this technology is valuable in learning environments, to read people's emotions better, and helping them out in the long run.		0
Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a fun and unique job. Like Luke you got to help many people and visit many places. Such as when Luke mentions that he took a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, a city with streets of water or when he saw the Acropolis in Greece. You also get to help many people. Luke being a Seagoing Cowboy meant that he supplied poor areas in Europe with cattle to recover their food supplies, animals, and more.  The reason why I say it is fun to be a Seagoing cowboy is, because as Luke mentions when all of the cattle was unloaded they often played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and baseball and volleyball games. Luke also mentions that being a Seagoing Cowboy was an oppurtunity of a lifetime that he would not want to miss. Luke aslo mentions that caring for the animals on these long voyages often kept him busy along with other things he had to do such as, feeding the animals, watering the animals two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship.  Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an interesting job. Your never bored, your always seeing places, and your always having fun. Whats not to like about it? For Luke being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more the adventure, but it opened up the world to him. He also so said that it made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That is why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.   		0
I do think this could be helpful in many ways, and could help in many ways. It's crazy what some technology can do now days. I think this could be used in a lot of mental and health situations if people are wanting help. This could help the doctor with these problems. But if they start using this in schools and things like that it might not work out as well. Thats just because some kids may not want that or parents.  I don't think this would be very helpful in a classroom. I don't see how it would work and help the school out or anyhing. Unless they are trying to track kids mental and emotional health. And this program is proabably a lot of money to have on computers. Some schools they can spend their money on better things for the kids of the school. Personal I just don't think it could help schools unless they have the program and are using this program for learning perposes.  Yes some schools and collages will use this for learning topics and other things for the kids to learn off of. But other than schools then school the only people I could see having this is like doctors or hospitals. It would be cool in the future if this could turn into a thing for animals and we could see their emotional and mental health. We would be able to see what like dogs or cats are thiking if they are happy or sad.  But this could be bigger in the near future and maybe could help a lot of people. I just don't see how it could help with anything that much. But everything usally has a reason why it's made and it will be used by some people with certain jobs with stuff like this. The big thing on it is it really could help with people that have emotional problems or i guess mental problems too. Or if someone is depressed real bad or something like that.		0
Imagine never going to school again! instead you could take all your classes online from home. Online classes are very beneficial towards students who are unable to attend their classes at school. There are many reasons why someone may choose to take an online class. They could take their core classes online so they have more time to work towards their goals and their chosen electives during the school day. For some students, they might not have space in their schedule for the classes they want to take during the school day, so online courses would resolve this issue. Also, some students may not learn well in a physical classroom because they feel anxious and timid. In an online classroom they wouldn't face those obstacles, rather they're able to learn freely. Why choose to take your classes in school, when you can take them from the comfort of your own home. 6  How an online class works is that it's held at a certain time every week. During this hour long session the teacher turns on her video cam and goes through a power point teaching us what we need to know for the week. Afterwards, there are several assignments that are posted in Google Classroom that we must complete before our next class. This is done so you have the same workload as the students who take it in school. To be able to excel in your online course you need to manage your time very well. You should be able to balance your in school classes and your online classes, as well as any extra curricular activity you may have. 6  There are many reasons why someone might take an online course. The main reasons are either push or pull. A push factor would be something that forced you to take an online class. A pull factor would be something that attracted you to take an online course. An example of a push factor would be if your school shut down and you would need to complete your courses online. For example, the threat of corona virus has caused some schools to shut down to keep everybody healthy and continue their courses online from home instead of coming to school. An example of a pull factor would be if your schedule was full and you wanted to take another class so you decided to take it online.7  Another great reason that online classes are beneficial are that the class you want may not be offered at your school so you can take it online from your home. You might also live far from the nearest school and do not have a form of transportation to go to and back from school. Online classes would allow you the same education that is given to someone who physically shows up to school physically. This would be a push factor. A counter argument could be that some families might be not having a laptop to use for your online courses. I think many schools are starting to give out issued laptops to their students. If that is not the case or they dont have WIFI, they could always go to the nearest library and make use of the resources there.  In your online class there are going to be many students from many different schools, and the teacher that will be running the class could also be from a different school. You would take the online class from wherever you want, until it is time to take your midterm and final. During the Midterm and final you will be asked to go to the teachers school and test in person to make sure there is no foul play. Even though you are at home and can cheat on many things, you should not. Not only because its against the rules, but also if you score 2 letter grades below on your midterm and final than your overall grade, it would seem as if you were cheating and it you could get in trouble. Overall, it doesnt matter if you were a push factor or a pull factor, online courses are beneficial to students no matter what circumstance you are in.		0
Dear senator in the sources "What is the Electoral College?" by the Office of the Federal Register, "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defences of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer  and also "In Defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president" by Richard A. Posner, the authors of the article discuss the pros and cons to having an electoral college. The citizens of the United States would be more pleased if the electoral college stayed as opposed to it being ebolished.  To begin, having a electoral college will be better for the nation and people.  for example, the article "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president" the article states "A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is very possible- it happened in 2000- but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote." this claim provides a true statement on reasons why we should keep the electoral college. This statement means that disputes are less likely with their method and their is a certainty of an outcome.  Although keeping the electoral college is a valid idea, there are some problems associated with keeping the electoral college as well. Of course, there are difficulties with in the curcumstsance where we keep the Electoral Collage opposed to disspose of it. the article "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer, Plumer made several claims opposing of the electoralcollege, such claims include "At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters" and opinons like "Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irration". While Plumer did put his point across as to how the system is unfair we must take into consideration how it is more reasonable and appropriate, in "in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president" the article states that "The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal" which is fair and less stressful.  in summary, the best option would to keep the way things are rather than changing things up and and creating a more stressful, unorganized system. Although Plumer made accurate claims as to some of the faults in the system, there was far more proof in keeping the electoral college and keeping things the same.                                                    		0
The electoral college is the current method for choosing a president of the United States.  In this method, voters from each state do not vote for the president directly, they vote for people to elect the president.  Even though this system has existed for decades and decades, some people protest is and claim that it is not "democratic" enough.  I will give my personal opinions on why the Electoral College should be kept.  The main reason for keeping the Electoral College is that it works, and has been working for over 200 years.  When a way of living has been around as long as this has, it is extremely difficult to change and convince people to support the change.  Again, it works and as the saying goes, "if it is not broke, do not fix it."  Though, "is not" and "do not" are contractions in the actual expression.  I can see why the people who protest the Electoral College dre against it, and that a president should be decided by the people, not electors chosen by people.  However I do not think it makes much of a difference who is being trusted to do what one likes about them.  It is either the elector is trusted to pick the right president, or the president is trusted do do the right thing.    		0
Driverless cars are in our near future, but is this the best way? There are many reasons why I dont believe so, such as the fact that they are going to need to make logical decisions and could be dangerous to drivers and pedestrians due to the drivers not needed to pay as much attention to driving.  What does it mean for a computer to make a logical decision? Lets imagine that your in a driverless car, and your headed towards an inevidable crash that will kill you. The only way to get out of it is to go on the sidewalk, where 3 small children are playing hop-scotch. If your watching "in-car entertainment" and the computer decides that you need to take over at this time, there is no time for us as humans to think. This is a major problem that will come up. Unless everyone's cars are fully driverless, its hard to prevent this scenario. This would mean we would have to make traditional cars as we know it, illegal.  Fully driverless cars are coming, but there are a lot of problems that we need to address before that happens. The idea of logical decision making for a computer processing things in 1's and 0's is a hard conundrum to overtake. Once we address whether or not the government keeps or takes away our driving privledes, then we can garauntee that our roads will be fully safe. 		0
Hey there!  For this essay, I'm gonna talk about why elderly people like to go outside and play games, specifically hopscotch and tag.   First off, let's talk about why elderly people like to go outside in general. I mean, it's not like they're trying to get away from their grandkids or anything . But seriously, going outside can be really good for them. It's like, they get to breathe fresh air, feel the sun on their face, and maybe even see some birds or squirrels.  It's like, they get to connect with nature and all that jazz. Plus, it's a great way for them to get some exercise, which is important for their health and stuff.  Now, let's talk about hopscotch.  Oh my gosh, hopscotch is like, the best game ever!  It's like, you draw a big square on the ground with numbers and then you hop on one foot from number to number. It's like, so easy to play, but it's also really challenging at the same time.  And the best part is, you can play it with your friends or by yourself. It's like, the perfect game for when you're bored or when you just want to have some fun.   But wait, there's more!  Tag is also super fun.  It's like, you get to run around and chase people, and sometimes you even get to be "it" and chase everyone else.  It's like, so much fun and it's a great way to get some exercise too. Plus, you can play it with a bunch of people or just with one or two friends. It's like, the perfect game for when you're feeling energetic or when you just want to have some fun.   Now, let's talk about the advantages of playing games like hopscotch and tag.		1
Although some say students would not be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because the capacity of learning decrease, actually students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because the efficiency to proccess information increase and each student will demostrate the level of learning by their efforts.  Some say students would not be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because the capacity of learning decrease.  "President of teachers from the american confederation of learning"(article 1).  "Survey from teachers to parents in the United States"(article 2).  Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because the efficiency to proccess information increase.  "The space from being at home make the concentration easier for students"(article 2).  "Enough time to complete classworks and asigments"(article 1).  Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because each student will demostrate the level of learning by their efforts.  "The capacity to find information by their own"(article 1).  "Development to take responsabilities and knowledge to manage them"(article 2).  Although some say students would not be benefit from being attend classes from home because the capacity of learning decrease, actually students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because the efficiency to proccess information increase and each student will demostrate the level of learning by their efforts.  In conclusion, this type of learning from home, benefit students, and teachers in many ways. All schools should concider the offer for students to attend classes from home, by way of online or video conferencing.   		0
To the principal:  Community service is good most of every body like's to do it but, there is about 20 to 30% of the people in the school dose not like to do community service. And you try to make every student do community service  I think they should have a saying weather they want to do it or if they don't want to do it. It's not alright for them not to have a saying.  If they are in iss then I think the need to do community service then but if they do nothing wrong and t they don't want to do it then they should not have to. You can go around school taking a survey about who wants to do community service and who don't want to do community service.  What if there grandma or grandpa was in the hospital dying and they had to do community service and they don't get to day goodbye to them.  Now if you don't make them then if they do have someone in the hospital dying they would get to say goodbye to them. It would be good for the environment and it might do some good for some students but, if they say no then they should not be forced to do it. So take a vote who wants to and who don't want to do it.  sincerely your student.		0
Cars! Cars! Cars! Some might say that you cant even live without them. Which is why cars and motors have become a serious problem all through out the globe. Passages like " The end of a car culture" Source 4 By Elisabeth Rosenthal and " Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota " Source 3 By Andrew Selsky, Explain and show to the reader that The pollution that is caused by engines have become a serious problem through out the world and we need to limit car usage now!  Source 4, Explains The actions that our president Barack Obama is Taking to make the world a safer And Cleaned air place. By limiting car use it can help us tramendisly but what you do to make that happen is key. As written, Studies show that americans are purchasing fewer cars, licenses, and also driving as more and more years go by. Some might have a different opinion or perspective and say that cars are their life and that is the only way they will function. While others see and appreciate the advantages of limiting car usage. Many things including Less traffic, less accidents , more safety , and better health come as positive outtakes for lessening automotive use. One thing surprisingly that is good for your health as a result of no cars is cycling. "New yorks bike sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities". I can see that just by leaving your car once a week at home and using a bike, You can get a workout , arrive at your destination quicker, and you might even get into the habit of leaving your car at home more often. So it does'nt hurt to try it once, Plus you can also save about thirty bucks which is fine by me and my wallet.  Source 3 , Explains the rules and laws that some countries are making to prevent less auto use and cleaner air. Andrew emphasizes on the program in Bogota,Columbia that makes a mandatory carfree daytwo days throughout the well populated city. Over all it was a great turn out ,but know matter where you go their is always going to be some of those hard headed people who just dont like the whole concept. Which of course those violators are fined with twentyfive dollars. I think this was a great idea in showing that the city does care about the environment and care about the peoples safety and health." It is a Good opportunity to take Away stress and air pollution..." as well.  Cars! As much as we love them they are some what damaging so it wont kill you if you just give it a rest and try cycling or walking ,you can benefit from it in many ways and it might even save some ecosystems.		0
When making decisions, it can be useful to consider advice from multiple people in different situations, as it can help provide a broad perspective. Having multiple viewpoints can help identify potential benefits and drawbacks that might otherwise be overlooked. For example, if making a career decision, receiving advice from a mentor in the profession, a current colleague, and a former classmate who once pursued the same option can provide a comprehensive assessment of the pros and cons of the potential option.   On the other hand, there can be drawbacks to receiving and considering advice from too many different people. Having multiple perspectives can be difficult to process all at once, and it might cause confusion and conflicting opinions. It is important to weigh each person's advice carefully, or else it could create too much doubt or indecision when making a choice.		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and replacing it with a system of direct election for President of the United States.  The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that has no place in our 21st century democracy. It is a system that allows for the possibility of a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election, as happened in 2000 and 2016. It is a system that gives disproportionate power to small states, and it is a system that disenfranchises millions of voters.  The Electoral College was designed in the 18th century as a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by Congress and those who wanted the president to be elected by a popular vote of the people. However, the Electoral College has long outlived its usefulness. It is no longer necessary to protect the interests of small states, and it is no longer a fair or democratic way to elect the president.  A system of direct election would be much fairer and more democratic. It would ensure that the candidate who receives the most votes wins the election. It would also give all voters their fair say in the election, regardless of where they live.  I urge you to support a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College and replace it with a system of direct election for President of the United States. This is a common-sense reform that would make our democracy stronger and more representative of the will of the people.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Also some school do not agree this option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because this could affect your student life with not learning so well, you will not complete your assignment like in the school and you will not have a good environment social with more people.  Some school do not agree this option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because this could affect you with not learning so well. When you are in the school and the teacher is teaching you it is better than be in your home because you have the option of not do your work or may be you do not understand the assignment and is better when somebody is explaining you. We see that take your classes online is not good because like students sometimes we are lazy and we are not going to do it like in the school.  Some school do not agree this option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because this could affect you with not complete your assignment at the time like in the school. Sometimes we take the option hang out with our friends and we have work to do, take our classes online, but first thing that we do is leave our work as the last thing to do, the time will go over and we are not going to finish our work and we are going to fall, because is nobody telling you what you have to do and you have to complete all your assignments. You can see that take your classes online is not good because we can choice if do it or not and this is not good for us like students.  some school do not agree this option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because this could affect you with do not have a good environment social with more people. If you just are in your home taking your classes probably you are not going to know different people like new and good friends who can help you with your work or maybe with others problems and you will not have with who be talking or hang out with them after school. You can see one more time that take your classes online is not a good way to have a good environment like in the school.  To conclude like students we can see that take your classes online could affect your students life in different ways and is better to attend in a school to take your classes and have a good education.                  		0
The main idea of this story is The Challenge Of Exsploring They go to venus sometime called Evening star is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Making it simple Venus is the second planet from our sun. Often reffered to Earths twin. Venus is the closets planet to to Earth in terms of density too. They say venus is 90% carbon diaxide blankets Venus. Clouds are highly corrosive sulferic acid in Venus atomsphere..Human counter on Eath duch and enviroment would crush even a sumberine accustomed to dividing to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. i want to know why sciencetist even discuss further visitis to its surface. Venus still has some analogues to those on Earth. Maybe we should think of them challenges .Many reserches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last enough to contribute meaningful to our knowlege of Venus. Modern computers are enormously powerful flexible and quick but tend to be mo delicate when it come to extrem physical conditions...another lasted for three wekks in such conditions. Projects is looking back to to an old technology called merchanical computers. Basically this artical is about the second Earth and thats Venus in how Venus look and how it's bilted. Hoe NASA is working on other approches to studying Venus and how to work with this planet in process. in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war 2 so this planet has been involved in quit alot..		0
 Car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular around the world. These cities have gained a lot of attention in recent years because they are seen as a solution to some of the most pressing problems facing our society today, such as air pollution, traffic congestion, and a lack of physical activity. In this essay, we will explore what car-free cities are, their benefits, and some of the challenges that they face.   A car-free city is a city that has decided to remove all privately owned vehicles from their roads. This means that residents and visitors must rely on alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, biking, walking, and car-sharing services. Cities that have implemented car-free policies have seen many positive changes, such as improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and increased physical activity among residents.   One of the main benefits of car-free cities is reduced air pollution. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and by removing them from the roads, cities can significantly reduce the amount of harmful emissions in the air. In addition, car-free cities have seen a decrease in noise pollution, as the sound of cars no longer dominates the streets.   Another benefit of car-free cities is reduced traffic congestion. Cars are often the biggest cause of traffic congestion, and by removing them from the roads, cities can improve their traffic flow. This not only reduces congestion, but also makes it safer for pedestrians and cyclists to travel on the roads.   In addition to these benefits, car-free cities have also seen an increase in physical activity among residents. When cars are no longer readily available, people are more likely to walk or bike for their daily activities, such as commuting to work or running errands. This not only improves their physical health, but also allows them to enjoy the cleaner air and reduced traffic that comes with car-free cities.   Despite these benefits, car-free cities face several challenges. One of the biggest is the cost of implementing such a policy. Building bike lanes, pedestrian walkways, and public transit systems can be expensive, and cities must carefully consider the financial costs of these changes before imposing a car-free policy.   Another challenge that car-free cities face is resistance from residents and visitors. Some people are hesitant to give up the convenience and flexibility of owning a car, and may be frustrated with the additional time and effort required to travel without one. This resistance can make it difficult for cities to implement and enforce car-free policies.   In conclusion, car-free cities are an innovative solution to some of the most pressing problems facing our society today. By removing privately owned vehicles from the roads, cities can improve their air and noise pollution levels, reduce traffic congestion, and encourage physical activity among their residents. While it comes with its own set of challenges, the benefits of a car-free city are well worth considering for any city looking to improve its health and sustainability.		1
 "The Path to Success: Embracing Failure and Perseverance"  I firmly believe that the key to achieving success in life lies in embracing failure and perseverance. As Winston Churchill once said, "Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm." This statement highlights the importance of maintaining a positive attitude and a willingness to learn from our mistakes, even when we encounter setbacks and disappointments.  In my opinion, failure is not something to be feared or avoided, but rather an opportunity for growth and learning. It is through failure that we gain valuable experience and develop the resilience and determination needed to overcome challenges and achieve our goals. In fact, some of the most successful people in history, such as Thomas Edison and J.K. Rowling, have attributed their success to their ability to learn from failure and persist in the face of adversity.  However, it is important to approach failure with the right mindset. While it is natural to feel discouraged and frustrated when we encounter setbacks, it is essential to view failure as a learning opportunity and a chance to grow. This requires a willingness to take responsibility for our mistakes and to use them as stepping stones on the path to success.  In addition to embracing failure, it is also crucial to persevere in the face of adversity. Success is rarely achieved overnight, and it often takes time and hard work to achieve our goals. It is important to remain committed to our objectives, even when we encounter obstacles and setbacks. This requires a strong work ethic, a positive attitude, and a willingness to learn from our mistakes.  In conclusion, the path to success is paved with failure and perseverance. It is essential to embrace failure as a learning opportunity and to view it as a chance to grow and develop. At the same time, it is important to persevere in the face of adversity and to remain committed to our goals, even when we encounter setbacks and disappointments. By doing so, we can achieve success and fulfillment in all areas of our lives.		1
 Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are self-driving cars that are capable of functioning without any human intervention. They use advanced sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to navigate roads, avoid obstacles, and make decisions based on real-time data.  One of the key advantages of driverless cars is that they have the potential to reduce accidents caused by human error. Studies have shown that human error is a leading cause of accidents on the road, accounting for up to 92% of all accidents. By removing the human element from the equation, driverless cars have the potential to significantly reduce the number of accidents on the road.  In addition to improving safety, driverless cars also have the potential to reduce traffic congestion and improve efficiency. By using AI algorithms to optimize traffic flow, driverless cars can help reduce the number of cars on the road and minimize the time drivers spend stuck in traffic. This could lead to significant decreases in travel time and increased productivity for drivers.  Another potential benefit of driverless cars is that they could make driving accessible to people who currently cannot or choose not to drive, such as the elderly, disabled individuals, and people with health conditions. This would provide these individuals with greater independence and could improve their quality of life.  However, there are also potential downsides to driverless cars. One concern is the potential for job losses due to automated vehicles, as many people currently work as drivers. While there may be some displacement, there are also opportunities for new jobs in areas such as computer science, engineering, and maintenance of autonomous vehicles.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize transportation by improving safety, reducing traffic congestion, and providing greater independence to people who currently cannot or choose not to drive. While there are potential downsides to this technology, it is worth exploring further to determine the potential benefits and challenges.		1
 The future of transportation seems to be moving away from cars, with many cities around the world implementing policies to reduce their reliance on personal vehicles. These car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular among urban planners and residents alike, as they offer a range of benefits and have the potential to revolutionize the way we live. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of car-free cities and discuss some of the successful examples of this movement.  One of the main benefits of car-free cities is that they provide a safer and healthier environment for residents. Cars are one of the leading causes of air pollution and traffic deaths in urban areas, and by removing them from the streets, car-free cities can significantly reduce these problems. People are able to walk, bike, or use public transportation instead, which not only reduces emissions, but also allows for more physical activity, resulting in a healthier population. Additionally, reducing the number of cars on the road can lead to a decrease in accidents, as there are fewer cars vying for space on the same road.  Another advantage of car-free cities is that they promote sustainability and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Cars are the largest source of transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions, and by eliminating them, car-free cities can make a significant impact on reducing our carbon footprint. This is especially important as the world becomes more concerned about climate change and the need to reduce our reliance on non-renewable energy sources. Car-free cities also reduce the need for large parking lots and garages, freeing up valuable urban space and reducing the amount of impermeable surface area.  Car-free cities can also have a positive impact on the economy. By reducing the need for personal vehicles, car-free cities can encourage more people to use public transportation, which can help to fund the expansion of public transportation infrastructure. This can create jobs and stimulate economic growth in the city. Additionally, reducing traffic congestion can increase productivity by reducing the time people spend commuting.  There are many successful examples of car-free cities around the world. One of the most well-known is Copenhagen, Denmark, which has invested heavily in public transportation infrastructure and encourages citizens to bike and walk instead of driving. As a result, the city has a low pollution rate and a high quality of life. Another example is Amsterdam, Netherlands, which has implemented a comprehensive public transportation system and encourages residents to use bikes for shorter trips. Beijing, China, has also implemented a number of car-free zones in the city center, which has led to a reduction in air pollution and an increase in public transportation use.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a range of benefits, including improved public health, increased sustainability, and a more vibrant economy. The success of cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam demonstrates that car-free policies can be effective in reducing pollution and promoting a more livable environment. As urban populations continue to grow, the need for sustainable transportation solutions will only become more important, and car-free cities may become the future of transportation in our cities.		1
 High school students should not be allowed to graduate with a three-year program because it can create additional stress and pressure on their already busy schedules. While some students may have a job or extracurricular activities that require their attention, graduating early can still be challenging and demanding.  One of the main reasons why graduating early can be stressful is that it may require students to take on more advanced courses that are more challenging and require more homework. Additionally, some students may have to stay after school to retake important quizzes or tests that are critical to their grade, which can take away from their ability to participate in extracurricular activities or spend time with their families.  Another reason why graduating early can be challenging is that students may have to juggle multiple responsibilities, such as work or volunteering, in addition to their academic pursuits. This can be especially challenging for students who have to balance these responsibilities with their extracurricular activities, which may require them to stay after school or commit to community service projects.  Furthermore, graduating early can also impact a student's ability to attend college or pursue higher education. While some students may be ready to move on to the next stage of their education, others may need more time to prepare and develop the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in college or beyond.  In conclusion, graduating early with a three-year program can be challenging and stressful for high school students. While some students may have a job or extracurricular activities that require their attention, graduating early can still be demanding and require additional time and effort. Therefore, it is important for high school students to take their time and graduate with their class, allowing them to fully develop and prepare for the next stage of their education.		1
In The Challenge of Exploring Venus the pursuit despite the danger the author include that thar are almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide is on venus and the temperes average over 800 dergrees fahrenheit. NASA is telling us like how it not liveabul on venus. venus has the hottest suface temperature of any plantet in our solar system. NASA has been sening thing to Venus but the hostile conditions on the surface of venus is bad so NASA idea for sending thing to venus is having vehicl hovering 30 or so mile above the roiling landscape. having vehicl hovering over the landscape of venus.  The text also state even a vehicl will have so much time to hovering over venus because the light can't penetrate the dense atmosphere. More importantly resher can't take anything because it is dense atmosphere. Fot them to seeking any info thay would have to get up close and personal despite the risks. Having knowledge fo venus meney researcher are working on some simplifed electronice.  The National Aeronautis and space Administration have a idea for sending humans with haveing bad condush. At Venus temperatures would be around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Stat frome the text researchers are working on innvations that would alloe our mechines to last longer enought to contribute meningfully to our knowedge of Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus.		0
car usage should be limited across the world there are many free car citys. After days of near record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. paris ban driving due to air smug cars are the cause to air pollution today. passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe. If we keep using cars as much it will hurt us in a long run. Are enviroment and the air will not be healthy to breath people will die it will be a huge break out then we will not be able to drive cars.  car free day is turning to a big hit i Bogota in a program that set to spread to other countries. millions of colombians particapated in the event. It was the third stright year that cars have been banned with only buses. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and ruduce smog. people that does not listen and violators faced $25 fines. no0w people are hraing abouty the cause of less driving and diffrent cities are joining in on the fun.  Internet is a big part of why people have stop driving because people fill like they can use there social life to communicate with people instead of getting in there cars and going places to meet up with their family or peers. As of april 2013 thge number of miles driven wentr down 9 percent below the peak and equel to where the country was in january 1995.  Another benifit of limiting car usage is that it will benifit the health ofd citizens citizens both mentally and physically. in the german subborn of vauban, citizens have given uup their cars.

Is getting advice the right thing to do? I believe when in doubt or if you are just seeking advice it is always beneficial to ask different people what they think. You get different insight from each person about your topic, you get to confirm truly about what you were thinking, and you get more knowledge on whatever you are asking their advice for.  When you ask people for advice on topics you are mainly asking for their opinion. Asking a lot of people gives you a lot of different opinions to really choice to listen to. Which really helps build your mindset on that topic. After getting the advice you can better focus on your topic. In general getting advice about life or how to be a better person doesn't just improve you but also how you see other people.  Getting advice from other people can also help you confirm what you were truly asking the advice for. Getting advice on your concept gives you an advantage because now you know what other people think of your idea. It also helps you change and create newer and better ideas off of their advice. If lots of people said that they didn't think your idea was good then that would prompt you to make a better one. Which in the end only benefits you even more by creating something even better than before.  Many times people hate being wrong but if they don't ask for advice then how can they learn? For example, lets say you are working on a school art project and you've been working really hard, you want to ask people for their advice on it but you are too scared that they won't like it. How can you learn from the advice that they give you if you won't even let them give it. It is actually proven that when receiving advice from multiple people you are more likely to improve on that topic. You should never be afraid of advice because it can only make you learn.  Once again, I believe that getting advice from multiple people is super beneficial. It gives you insight into different people's mind site, you get to confirm what you were truly thinking, and you get to have more knowledge on topics. To conclude, never be shy when asking people what they think because the best person is the one that can take in information and adapt with it. 		0
Phones and Driving  In the united states cell phones while driving has been a big issue. Several laws have been passed to prevent people from using cellphones while driving and limit using the phones while in a vehicle. The Nation safety council reports the people using cell phones while driving leads up to nearly 2 million crashes a year. And almost 400,000 injuries occur from crashes in a year. Texting and driving should be illegal because the crash rates of using a mobile phone while driving almost triple.  People consider drunk driving to be more dangerous than texting while driving. The chance of an accident while using a mobile phone is six times bigger than the chance a DUI accident. It is said that in 2018 the safest way to use a cell phone while driving would be to attach it to the radio system or another suitable hands-free device via Bluetooth. Using the microphone on a phone while driving is illegal, even if it is not actually being held by the driver.  Even though using a cell phone in a vehicle via Bluetooth is safer than holding the phone, it isn't completely safe. While the distraction is smaller using the microphone could still cause an accident and the driver would take responsibility in court. Its suggested that a person should just simply postpone calls until you arrived at where ever your destination was. The statistics show that younger drivers are four times more likely to cause a road accident due to using a phone.  Statistics in 2019 show the 80% of the teens use cellular devices while in a vehicle. In the past few years rates of car accidents have increased extremely. People even ignore new implemented laws that have been put in place to ban using phones while driving. It is suggested that parents should also avoid calling their teens while he or she is driving. Instead ask to be called before leaving and after arriving at the destinations. Teens may always feel compelled to answer a parent call if received and that could be a big issue.             		0
What comes to mind when you think of the word school? Do you think about waking up early, going to boring classes, and lots of tests and homework? Well what comes to mind when you think about online schooling at home? Do you think about lounging in bed, eating whatever you want whenever you want, and doing work only when you feel like it? That's how most students think about these two different types of schooling, but when you think about it, is going to school really that bad when compared to online school? When looking at the big picture, I don't think that students would benefit from being able to take classes at home because there is less social interaction, there are more distractions, and there aren't as many fun experiences.  I feel that if students were to take online classes at home, they wouldn't get to learn how to collaborate with their peers. A school environment is essential in that it teaches students how to collaborate with peers and gain leadership skills through projects and assignments. These are skills that are important for the workplace and for working with people throughout life. School is usually the place where most people meet their first friends and learn how to talk to and deal with those peers as they grow up. I feel that online school takes that aspect of socialization away from students and doesn't allow them to put themselves out there because they're always at home. With that being said, it is also easier for students at home to turn to social media to communicate with others, which can be dangerous because they don't really know who they're interacting with.  I also feel that taking online classes at home could jeopardize students' learning because being in the comfort of their home will make for more distractions that wouldn't be available in a classroom, such as T.V., phones, video games, etc. Students will be more inclined to use these things because they are readily available. When taking classes at school, students don't have access to as many distractions because most teachers don't permit the use of personal technology in the classroom. Students are also more inclined to procrastinate and slack off when they take classes online because the teacher isn't monitoring their work, whereas in a school classroom, the teacher is in the room making sure that the students are completing their assignments on time. I know from personal experience that students are more likely to work when they are in a working environment, so I think that it wouldn't be beneficial to have them work at home.  Finally, I feel as though online school makes students miss out on some fun experiences that happen at school, such as after school clubs and activities that might provide students the opportunity have great experiences and bond with the new people they've met, field trips to museums, colleges, and amusement parks, school dances, which provides chances for them to go out and have fun with their friends, etc. Online school doesn't give students any outlet to do these activities as a group. Although the students might be able to do these activities on their own time, doing it as a school and seeing everyone united and having fun together gives a sense of belonging, and it makes them feel like they're part of a team.  Although the thought of online schooling at home is nice, I feel that it's important to remember that going to school makes students more well-rounded and provides them with many more opportunities. Students get to start to venture out and learn more about the world they live in and the people in it. I believe that school will give students unforgettable experiences, good or bad, that will teach them essential life lessons.		0
Seeking for advice is like learning how to ride a bike because they both require help from other people . If I had a choice, I would want multiple to give me advice for that certain situation. Some reasons for why I think seeking for other opinions is very important are it can give you a wide range of options when trying to find advice, It will allow you to understand the other persons experiences when asking for advice, and looking for other opinions can give you a variety of different answers so you can make better choices.  The first reason for why I think asking people for advice will help a person make better choice is when you ask all of those people for some advice is when you ask all of those people their all going to respond with their own opinions. Finding multiple people for advice can give someone a big boost of confidence on their choices. This is important because you never know the situation that person is in, and your opinion can make a difference. Sometimes its best to respond with a negative or a positive response depending on the advice their asking for. For example, If your best friend walks uo to you and says " yo man, can I have some advice on how to run faster," you would probably respond with a helpful response.  Secondly, It will allow you to understand the other persons experiences when asking for advice. When you go around looking for help and talking to people you start to understand them. What Im trying to say is that when they're sharing their advice with you, their basically just sharing their own experiences with you. Thats why asking different people people is so important because your going to get a different picture every time. To give you an example, my brother and I once went zip lining before, and we had no clue what we were doing. so we asked for some advice from our mom. She told us a lot of crazy nonsense that would probably end up making us choose a bad choice. After that we decided to ask someone we thought had a lot more experience. We ended up asking the zip line instructor, and he gave us a hole bunch of factual information that lead us to make a better choice.  Lastly, looking for other opinions can give you a variety of answers so you can make better choices. Being able to make a choice that can affect you your life in a bad or good way can be very essential to your life. Ways to prevent you from making those bad choices can be as simple as someone for advice. Depending on the circumstance, you would want to ask different people. If I was in a situation that involved school, I would most likely ask my teacher. All of these situations that you have will also have a match to it for example, If your struggling to loose weight, you would probably ask your doctor for some advice, If you needed extra practice with a sports, you would ask your coach. These examples all add up. They all require just a little bit of help.  To sum everything up, I feel like asking for advice in many different ways can really help you out when trying to an answer to something. Hopefully now you can take some of the ways that I expressed, and use them in every day life. Another thing to remember is that a person or whatever your using to get advice can make an impact on your choice, whether its in a good or bad way. The last thing I have to say is to remember to not let another person decide your outcome unless you feel confident about their answer.		0
[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP] [Email Address] [Phone Number] [Date]   [Senator’s Name] [Senator’s Address] [City, State, ZIP]   Subject: The Benefits of Keeping the Electoral College   Dear [Senator’s Name],   I am writing to you today to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in place for the election of the President of the United States. While many argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College serves important purposes and should be preserved. In this letter, I will present arguments in favor of the Electoral College system, drawing evidence from various sources.   One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides regarding the outcome of the presidential election. Judge Richard A. Posner argues that disputes over electoral votes are less likely to occur than disputes over the popular vote. He states that because the winner-take-all system is used in most states, even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide victory in the electoral vote for that state (Posner, 2012). This system ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote exceeds their share of the national popular vote, reducing the likelihood of contested election results.   Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the concept of a president who represents the entire nation. As Judge Posner suggests, a presidential candidate must have broad trans-regional appeal to win the electoral vote. This prevents a candidate with only regional support from being elected and ensures that the president will be accountable to the interests of people from all regions of the country (Posner, 2012).   Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign across different states, including swing states. Bradford Plumer points out that candidates tend to focus their campaign efforts on swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain (Plumer, 2008). This means that voters in swing states receive more attention from candidates and may be more informed and thoughtful in their voting decisions. In turn, this ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who are well-informed about the candidates and their policies, have a greater influence in deciding the election.   Moreover, the Electoral College system balances the weight of large states against smaller states, addressing the potential imbalance created by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Judge Posner argues that the Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates because winning by a similar margin in a large state yields more electoral votes than in a small state (Posner, 2012). This allows candidates to address the concerns and interests of both large and small states, preventing an imbalance in representation.   Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, run-off elections can complicate the election process. Posner (2012) highlights that the Electoral College method selects a clear winner, even if the popular vote results in a plurality. This ensures a more straightforward and conclusive outcome, reducing the uncertainty and potential for prolonged election disputes.   In conclusion, the Electoral College serves important functions that benefit the nation as a whole. It provides certainty in election outcomes, ensures that the president represents the entire country, encourages candidates to campaign in diverse states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While some argue for a popular vote system, the Electoral College remains a crucial component of our democratic system. I strongly recommend preserving the Electoral College to maintain its numerous benefits.   Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I hope that you will take these arguments into account as you make decisions regarding the future of our presidential election system.   Sincerely,   [Your Name]		1
Senator [Name],  I write to you as a student studying the intriguing and complex fabric of American democracy. A considerable debate that I am currently studying is centered around the enduring institution of the Electoral College, a distinctive mechanism our Founding Fathers established for the presidential elections. Within the scope of this discussion, I would like to advocate for the continued use of the Electoral College System, while acknowledging some of the criticisms and limitations inherent in this system.  One of the primary arguments against the Electoral College is that it appears undemocratic, as the president is ultimately elected by electors rather than the popular vote (Posner 15). Critics also emphasize the possibility of elector manipulation and the risk of a presidential election being influenced by "faithless" electors (Plumer 11). Notably, criticism has also been focused on the system's unfair concentration on swing states (Plumer 13). While these critiques are well-founded, I would like to offer a multifaceted defense of the Electoral College.  Initially, the certainty of outcome that's inherent in the system is a significant advantage (Posner 18). As with any system, disputes can arise, but they're often less ambiguous due to the Electoral College's structure which often awards a larger proportion of total electoral votes to the victor (Posner 18). Furthermore, the system helps ensure that a president must demonstrate broad appeal, rather than focusing solely on densely populated urban areas or regions where they are most popular (Posner 19). Every state matters under this system, not just the populous ones.  Another key argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it encourages voters in swing states to engage closely with the election process (Posner 20). These voters are central to determining the outcome of the election, which fosters greater political engagement and thoughtful deliberation on the issues at hand. Moreover, the Electoral College offers a counterbalance to potential inequalities presented by Senate apportionment, offering large states more influence in the presidential election (Posner 21).  In my view, an often overlooked advantage of the Electoral College is that it inherently precludes the need for run-off elections, resulting in a clear decision (Posner 22). This, in turn, reduces the complication in the overall presidential election process, contributing to its efficiency.   Granted, concern exists that voters in staunchly Republican or Democratic states may not vote because the outcome is a foregone conclusion (Posner 23). I would argue, however, that this challenge can be overcome with increased civic education and voter engagement initiatives, emphasizing the value of expressing a political preference through voting.   To conclude, I believe the Electoral College, uniquely American in its design, remains a viable method for selecting the president. Even though the notion of direct democracy through a direct popular vote seems attractive and simplistically fair, we must consider the practical implications and consequences. It is crucial to ensure the system continues to strike a balance that represents all Americans' interests irrespective of their location. For all its foibles, the Electoral College assures this representation, fostering a federalist and representative democracy that has persevered since our country's inception.  Respectfully yours,  [Your Name]		1
With technology advancing you can drive your own car like how you see them in the movies. Technology is advancing to the point of driverless cars and they will be seen more in the near future. Though severl might think that having driverless cars can be dangerous, the technolgy advancing will make it to where you might not have to buy a car in the future. Driverless will be safe to drive on the roads even without a driver.  Sensors on the car can keep you from danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. Sensors are nothing new, but with the technology advancing since the 1980s automakers can make a car that allows far better responce and control than a human driver. With futher improvments on computer hardware and sensors, automakers can design car that can handle more driving tasks on their own.  The anitlock brake and driver assticance system has made its own way on helping the full invention of driverless cars. Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that with the technolgy progressing consumers can have a driverless cab take us wherever we would like to go. Along with the sensors the radar will help with the antilock system to make that dream come ture.  BMW has already annouced the development of "Traffic Jam Assistant". It's a car the can handle driving up to 25 mph, but touch sensors keeps the driver holding the wheel in case of a malfunction. The human driver must remian alert and be able to take over in certain situations. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road.  Several may argue that a driverless car is not safe. A variety of car companies have and are developing safety devices to assure the safety of everyone. GM has developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Automakers and manufacturers are assuring your safety while deveopling the future.  Safety is the number one key to the adevances of driverless cars. From sensors, antilock brake and driver assistance systems, and development for the advanced technology; automakers and manufacturers are assuring your safety. That is why they are developing the technology further to insure that consumers are safe while they have made technological advances. 		0
In the article "Driveless Cars Are Coming" the author talks a lot about how driveless cars could be a good thing and a bad thing. My thoughts on driveless cars are negitive. My thoughts are only negitive because anything could go wrong.  One of my thoughts on driveless cars are what if you have to suddenly stop in an unknown place how whould the car know it has to stop. A driveless car could be or maybe would be the cause of most car accidents. Everyone wouldnt even know how to work it because we wernt born with it. It would maybe be a great technology but most people wouldnt be confortable doing or not doing something they havent did all their lifes.  Another one of my thoughts on driveless cars is when i think about a driveless car i think about all technology and there isnt a 100% chance that there wont be a malfunction. Most technology makes mistakes of has some type of glitch, so why would you put your life in the hands of a driveless car.  On earth, people are becoming lazier as the day goes by all the technology we have barely makes us want to move off of our couches. Which would also be another negitive thought about driveless cars.		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed to give smaller states more influence, it can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This undermines the principle of majority rule in a democracy.   Supporters of keeping the Electoral College argue that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and engage with a wide range of states. However, in recent elections it has incentivized focusing efforts only in swing states that could vote either way. Over half the states receive little or no attention from presidential candidates because they are reliably Democratic or Republican. This disadvantages voters in those states.  It is also argued that without the Electoral College, candidates might only campaign in large cities on the coasts. However, election by popular vote would not change the fact that votes are counted equally no matter where someone lives. Rural areas would still be well represented according to their population size. Candidates would still aim to appeal to a wide range of demographic and geographic groups to win a majority across the entire country.    A potential issue with electing by popular vote is that it could reduce the influence of smaller states. However, under the current system smaller states are still ignored if they do not happen to be swing states. And while their interests should still be considered, the presidency is meant to represent the national popular will. A system where the winner of the popular vote always wins would ensure the candidate preferred by more citizens prevails, upholding the principle of one person, one vote.  For these reasons, I believe a national popular vote would be more democratic and ensure that every vote counts equally regardless of what state someone lives in. It would incentivize candidates to appeal to a broader range of the American public rather than focusing on just a handful of swing states. I would therefore support a change to elect the president by the nationwide vote of the people instead of the current Electoral College system. Please consider supporting such a transition to a popular vote as well.  Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope my perspective has been insightful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Respectfully, [Your name]		1
I believe that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or opposite party. Also the problem comes up that the candidates do no go to there state thus never seeing them.  To began with I believe we should remove the Electoral Colleges. For the reason that voter are not voting but for a slate of electors. Who then elect the president, for example "if you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry. You'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."qoute form source 2 Those 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry may not win the statewide election. The voters also are not always able to control who there electors vote for. "Legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people." qoute form source 2. So there a chance they may change there mind and the president they wished to win may not win because the legislatures do not have to vote in there favor. In some case seventeen states didn't even see the candidates at all. Some states including Rhode Island and South Carolina, "and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." Also another reason why we should remove the Electoral Colleges is for the reason that voters may become confuse and vote for the wrong person.  furthermore we should remove the Electors Colleges, because its unfair to the voters. For example the winner takes all system in each state. Candidates don't spend times in the states they know they have no chance winning. "It can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state." qoute from source 3. But then what happens to the people in that wants to vote for them but can't because there votes go toward a slate of electors that votes for the other party. They focus on the swing states mostly. For Instance a Presidential race that happen were the electoral votes caused a certain party to win was. In 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Hore received more in dividual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. The electoral votes need to be removed because it causes problems in elections which makes any side able to win even though they don't have more individual votes. Another example is "Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast on him." qoute from sorce 3. Study shows that 60% of voters would prefer a direct election rather then what they have now.  On the other hand having the electoral votes may not be such a bad thing. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College also restore some of the weight in the political balance that large states. If you elect a good representive that you believe, and trust that will vote to your liking. Someone that would not turn his back on the will of the people then it would not be that bad. The process they go throught maybe difficult and hard to understand. So it could be a good thing they take the hard work off our backs and do it for us to save us the time and hardwork. The Electoral Colleges requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal rather then a single region appeal.  To conclude I believe that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or opposite party. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.		0
 In my opinion, attending regular classes at schools is the best option for students. This is because it allows students to socialize with other people and engage in various activities outside of the classroom. Additionally, attending school provides students with the opportunity to interact with teachers and other students, which can lead to new friendships and a more engaging learning experience.  While online classes can be a good option for students who may not have access to traditional classroom settings, such as those with disabilities or those who live far away from a school, they may not offer the same level of social interaction and engagement as attending school in person. Furthermore, online classes may require students to pay for courses or classes, which can be a barrier for some students.  It is important to note that the United States has the advantage of providing free education to all students. This is a great benefit for parents who may not have the financial resources to send their children to school. However, online classes may require students to find a job to support their payments for the courses, which can be a challenge for some students.  In conclusion, while online classes may be a good option for some students, attending regular classes at schools provides students with the opportunity to socialize, engage in activities, and interact with teachers and other students. The free education provided in the United States is a great benefit for parents and students alike.		1
Dear Principal,  I do think that students should perform in community service because it is very important to clean up our school and also to have a very good environment or all the animals in the ocean will die and when we want to go to the Aquarium they will be no more animals to see. Why not you might asked because most of them will be dead or might be surviving a death full time. For Example if the students in out school start to perform community service our school will always be clean and its a great work to show team work and that anything that we try to do it will always accomplished. I also don't think its a waste of time because we never give time to start caring about our environment and start caring and helping about others people health.  See if the more we liter and recycle the more healthier our plant will be and if we don't help then our environment will be very dirty we won't be able to breath our nice natural environment instead will be breathing dirty stuff and we don't want that to happen because then everybody in the plant will die including the animal it's like the end of the world but because we didn't give time to take care of our plant and just decided to do something else less important than our health.

The use of single-use plastic products has become a controversial topic due to its impacts on the environment. These products, such as plastic bags, straws, and water bottles, are used once and then discarded, often ending up in our oceans and landfills. While some argue that banning these products would be a violation of personal freedom, I believe that banning single-use plastics is necessary in order to protect the environment and promote sustainability.  One of the main reasons for banning single-use plastics is the devastating impact they have on marine life. Plastic bags, for example, can resemble jellyfish and are often mistaken for food by sea turtles, causing them to choke or suffocate. In addition, plastic microbeads, which are commonly found in face wash and toothpaste, can enter the water system and be consumed by fish, harming their digestive system. By banning these products, we can help protect marine life and prevent further damage to our oceans.  Another reason to ban single-use plastics is the amount of waste they produce. Plastic products are often not biodegradable, meaning they do not break down naturally in the environment. Instead, they break into smaller pieces called microplastics, which can be ingested by small animals and work their way up the food chain. According to the United Nations, if current trends continue, there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050. By banning single-use plastics, we can help reduce the amount of waste that ends up in our oceans and landfills.  Furthermore, banning single-use plastics can also help promote sustainability. Many alternative products, such as reusable water bottles and shopping bags, are made from sustainable materials and can be used multiple times. By switching to these products, we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, banning single-use plastics can also encourage companies to develop more sustainable packaging options, such as biodegradable or compostable materials.  Finally, banning single-use plastics can also have economic benefits. According to a study by the University of California, banning single-use plastic bags in California alone would save consumers $100 million per year. In addition, banning single-use plastics can also create jobs in industries such as recycling and sustainable manufacturing.  In conclusion, banning single-use plastics is necessary in order to protect the environment and promote sustainability. While some may argue that it is a violation of personal freedom, the benefits of banning these products far outweigh any potential drawbacks. By reducing waste, promoting sustainable alternative products, and creating economic benefits, banning single-use plastics can help create a more sustainable future for our planet.		1
 The use of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a promising method that could be valuable in various ways. In the article, the author explains how FACS works by analyzing and coding various micro-expressions on a person's face. These micro-expressions can convey a wealth of information about a person's emotions, even when they are trying to hide them. By utilizing FACS to analyze the expressions of students, teachers could gain valuable insights into their students' emotional states, which could help them better respond to their needs and improve their overall learning experience.  Firstly, FACS could help teachers better understand their students' emotional states, even if they are trying to hide them. For example, a student may display a fake smile or a neutral expression when they are feeling uncomfortable or unhappy. However, through FACS, teachers could identify micro-expressions that may indicate the student is not feeling as comfortable as they appear. This information could then be used to provide additional support or resources to help the student cope with their emotional difficulties.  Moreover, FACS could provide teachers with a way to assess the effectiveness of their teaching methods. By analyzing the facial expressions of students during class discussions or activities, teachers could gain insights into which teaching methods are most effective at eliciting positive emotions in their students. This information could then be used to refine their teaching strategies and improve the overall learning experience for their students.  Lastly, FACS could help to reduce bullying in schools. By identifying students who may be experiencing bullying, teachers could intervene early on and provide support to both the victim and the perpetrator. Early intervention could help to prevent the escalation of bullying and create a more supportive and inclusive school environment.  In summary, the use of FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a valuable tool that could provide numerous benefits. By better understanding their students' emotional states, teachers could provide additional support and resources to help them overcome their difficulties. Moreover, FACS could provide valuable insights into which teaching methods are most effective, helping to improve the overall learning experience for students. Finally, FACS could help to reduce bullying and create a more inclusive and supportive school environment.		1
Knowledge is a valuable asset that can help individuals make informed decisions and navigate through life effectively. While imagination can be a powerful tool for creativity and innovation, it can also lead to negative consequences, such as fear and being taken seriously. In this essay, I will argue that knowledge is better than an imagination, and I will explain why people may think negatively of someone with a big imagination, how it could lead to fear and being taken seriously, and how knowledge is better for these reasons.  Firstly, people may think negatively of someone with a big imagination because it can be seen as a sign of immaturity or lack of focus. An imagination can be a great tool for creativity and innovation, but it can also be a distraction from the real world. When someone is too focused on their imagination, they may neglect their responsibilities and fail to prioritize their education and career. This can lead to negative consequences, such as being taken seriously and not being taken seriously by others.  Secondly, an imagination can lead to fear and being taken seriously. When someone is too focused on their imagination, they may become overwhelmed by their thoughts and feelings. This can lead to anxiety and fear, which can be debilitating and affect their ability to function in the real world. Additionally, an imagination can be a distraction from the real world, which can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy for others. This can make people take others seriously and lead to negative consequences, such as being taken seriously and not being taken seriously by others.  On the other hand, knowledge is a valuable asset that can help individuals make informed decisions and navigate through life effectively. When someone has knowledge, they are better equipped to understand the world around them and make decisions that are based on facts and evidence. This can lead to positive consequences, such as being taken seriously and being respected by others. Additionally, knowledge can be a great tool for creativity and innovation, as it provides a foundation for new ideas and perspectives.  In conclusion, knowledge is better than an imagination because it can help individuals make informed decisions and navigate through life effectively. While an imagination can be a powerful tool for creativity and innovation, it can also lead to negative consequences, such as fear and being taken seriously. Knowledge, on the other hand, provides a foundation for understanding the world around us and making decisions that are based on facts and evidence. Therefore, it is important for individuals to		1
 A cowboy who rode the waves is a phrase that may seem a bit confusing at first glance, but the more you think about it, the more it makes sense. The image of a cowboy on a horse riding through the sea might seem strange, but there are many examples throughout history of people who have ridden their way through challenging and unique environments.  One of the most famous examples of a cowboy who rode the waves is the legendary cattle drive of Texas in the late 1800s. The cowboys were driving thousands of cattle across the vast, open plains of Texas and into the west, where the land was easier for them to make a living with the cattle. Unfortunately, the land between Texas and California was mostly covered by rivers, streams, and lakes, which made the journey difficult.  The cowboys, however, were not ones to give up easily. They rode their horses across streams and rivers, following the shallowest paths they could find in order to keep moving forward. They used their cowboy skills to keep the cattle safe and keep themselves in the saddle as they rode through rough waters.  Another example of a cowboy who rode the waves is the famous Sam Elliott, who became a cultural icon of cowboy life in the 1980s and 1990s. Elliott played the iconic character of Coyote in the popular TV show "The Dukes of Hazzard" and the legendary cowboy Western film "The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly."  Elliott's portrayal of Coyote as a classic cowboy who rode the high frontier was inspired by his own life experiences growing up in California in the 1940s and 1950s. He rode horses as a young boy and spent much of his youth watching old Western films, which influenced his love for the cowboy lifestyle.  Today, cowboys still ride the waves, whether it's in cattle drives across the country, rodeos and bull rides, or in rodeo competitions. These cowboys are true experts in their field, having spent years honing their skills and developing their ability to ride their horses in even the most challenging environments.  In conclusion, a cowboy who rode the waves is an interesting concept that has become a cultural icon in its own right. Whether it's the legendary cattle drive of Texas or the famous Sam Elliott, this idea of cowboys tackling the toughest of environments is a testament to their resilience and determination to succeed.		1
Car's? everyone has one right? or at least knows someone that has one. Do you ever think if car's are bad for the world? When i was younger i always wanted to have a car.

That everyone had to leave there car at home or get a ticket of 31 dollars. Almost 4000 drivers were fined and twenty seven had there car impounded.  Even in other places like germay it's ether a car or house. Everyone would take the house thats somewhere to lay your head every night were your kids make memories that you will forever cherish. Car's there isnt know really point to them but just to drive and get somehwere. You can take a bike or even walk while at the same time helping the world and helping your self. I'm not saying stop using car's there so bad you will die if you use a car no. I'm just saying use your car when you really need to.  If something is close by you just have a nice walk and enjoy the air the beauty of being outside. If your going somewhere far? take a bus it might cost a dollar or two but just think about it.

Then you would be everyone super hero, even mine.            		0
Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because different people have different perspectives and experiences, which means they may have different ideas and solutions to a problem. For example, if you are trying to decide which sport to play in middle school, talking to your mom, your coach, and a friend who plays sports can help you gather more information and consider different options. Your mom may have concerns about your safety, your coach may have suggestions based on your skills and interests, and your friend may share their own experiences and preferences. By considering all these different viewpoints, you can make a more informed decision that takes into account your own goals and needs as well as the advice of others.  Another benefit of seeking multiple opinions is that it can help you identify any biases or assumptions that you may have overlooked. For instance, if you are considering which college to attend, talking to your high school counselor, your parents, and a recent graduate can help you get different perspectives on the pros and cons of different schools, as well as any financial aid or scholarship opportunities that you may qualify for. By hearing from people with different backgrounds and expertise, you can broaden your understanding of the options available to you and make a more well-rounded choice.  Overall, seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because it allows you to gather more information, consider different perspectives, and identify any potential biases or assumptions that you may have. Whether you are making a small decision or a big one, it is always a good idea to seek advice from a variety of sources and weigh your options carefully before making a final choice.		1
The Open Seas Await  Growing up on a cattle ranch in rural Australia, I spent my days surrounded by the same flat scenery. While I enjoyed the ranch life, I dreamed of adventure beyond the farm fences. That's why when I saw an advertisement for the Seagoing Cowboys program, I knew it was my chance to set sail.   The article detailed the unique experiences participants got to enjoy aboard tall sailing ships. We would learn seamanship skills and help crew the vessels as they traveled between ports. No two days would be the same as we encountered new destinations, cultures, and wildlife. Just imagining all the incredible sights we might see - towering cliffs, vibrant coral reefs, pods of leaping dolphins - was exciting. As someone who had never before left the outback, this program promised a world of discovery.  Not only would we see new places, but we would face new challenges. Sailing a tall ship on the open ocean takes skill, coordination, and grit working as a team through all weather conditions. As a cowboy used to hard work under the Australian sun, I was eager for an adventure that would push my limits. Mastering the ropes and rigging alongside an international crew sounded hugely rewarding. The article also mentioned gaining leadership skills as more experienced sailors trained us. I wanted the chance to grow both at sea and as a person through these upcoming responsibilities.   Most importantly, upon completing the voyage I knew my horizons would be vastly expanded. No longer would my life's borders be defined by ranch fences. The article shared how past participants had continued traveling or even switched careers thanks to their renewed sense of possibility. If I joined this program, I might return home a different person, full of storied memories and insight into life beyond what I had ever seen before. How could an opportunity to experience the great unknowns of the sea not be seized?  For anyone seeking adventure, camaraderie, and life-changing perspectives, I recommend signing up for Seagoing Cowboys. The open oceans are calling - all you need to do is answer.		1
 A cowboy who rode the waves may seem like an oxymoron, but there is an excellent example of a cowboy who successfully transitioned to surfing in California during the 1960s.  In the late 1960s, many cowboys flocked to Southern California to enjoy the sunshine and surf. These cowboys brought with them their values of hard work, discipline, and a strong sense of community, which helped them adapt to their new environment and quickly became proficient surfers. One such cowboy was Jack Burton, a legendary figure in the surfing world.  Burton grew up on a ranch in Texas and spent much of his youth working cattle on horseback. However, when the rodeos dried up during the Depression, Burton began working in the oil fields. He soon realized that his job was too dangerous and decided to move to California to pursue surfing.  Burton quickly became a fixture in the California surf scene in the 1960s. He was known for his impressive rides on big waves, as well as his unconventional approach to surfing. He had a strong work ethic and spent countless hours practicing his technique and studying the ocean's movements.  Despite his success as a surfer, Burton never lost sight of his cowboy roots. He remained a member of the Southern California cowboy community, often bringing his surfing expertise to the rodeo scene. He even started his own surfing school, teaching others the skills he had honed over the years.  Burton's story serves as an example of how even the most seemingly disparate experiences can be used to create something beautiful. His background as a cowboy taught him the importance of hard work and determination, which helped him succeed in the surfing world. At the same time, his love of surfing allowed him to expand his horizons and experience new things.  In conclusion, the story of a cowboy who rode the waves shows us that with hard work, determination, and a strong sense of community, we can all find success and fulfillment in our pursuits. Whether we're working cattle on horseback or riding big waves on a surfboard, the same values that guide us can help us achieve our goals.		1
Curfews and the associated restrictions can play a valuable role in helping teenagers stay out of trouble. Being out at night can be hazardous, and curfews help to keep teens at home or in a safe place. In addition, curfews give teenagers extra time to focus on activities that bring them closer to family and friends. Teens can use the extra hours to build stronger relationships with their parents and siblings, or to work on projects in school or in the community. With the time provided by curfews, teens can take note of their responsibilities and develop into responsible young adults. Ultimately, curfews can be effective in curbing teenage activities that could lead to trouble.		1
 I believe that Winston Churchill's statement about the importance of failure in achieving success is still relevant today. Failure is a natural part of the journey to success, and it is crucial that we learn to embrace it rather than fear it.  Imagine if you were never to fail in your pursuit of success? Would you still be motivated to continue striving for it? I believe that it is the challenges we face along the way that make us stronger and more resilient. Failure helps us to identify our weaknesses and areas that require improvement. It also teaches us valuable lessons that we can apply to future endeavors.  Success is not just about achieving our goals, but also about the journey we take to get there. It is about perseverance, determination, and resilience. We must be willing to take risks and make mistakes in order to grow and develop. We must also be willing to learn from our failures and use them as stepping stones towards success.  One of the most important things we can do when faced with failure is to maintain a positive attitude. We must not give up or lose hope, but rather use our failures as opportunities to learn and grow. We must also be willing to ask for help and support when we need it. We are not alone in our journey, and there are many people who are willing to help us along the way.  In conclusion, I believe that failure is an essential part of the journey to success. We must learn to embrace it and use it as a tool for growth and development. We must also maintain a positive attitude and be willing to ask for help when we need it. With these qualities, we can overcome any obstacle and achieve our goals.		1
Texting and driving  The use of phones and cars serve many purposes such as communicating with others, playing games, and using the many different internet based features.  We use cars as a means of travel, others to modify and race, and make them look cool. In every day jobs like firefighters and police use cars to patrol neighborhoods and to travel to the location they are called to. For delivery like packages and food we use cars and phones for most of the things we do in modern society. But get in some accidents or cause accidents with cars and we get hurt because of these accidents physically and financially but they can be avoided taking precautions like insurance and driving safe and keep your car maintenance high or good . According to https://www. insurancejournal. com/news/national/2018/08/24/499107. htm  The death toll for 2018 is 18,720 and an additional 2.1 million people who have sustained serious injuries due to car accidents in the first six months of 2018. Texting and driving should not be aloud because it can kill people and its bad that it happens . People have lost their lives because of a text which is sad one moment your here next you're not you could be driving one day and text while driving with a blink of an eye you could be gone .  The laws and punishment the law should be to not be on your cell phone while driving or if you're are on it make sure it's on speaker phone or have somebody text on your phone to whoever. The punishment should be a fine or community service but no serious punishment because it was an accident . But if it was on purpose then should have jail time why because it was done intentionally and they knew exactly what they were doing . It's a accident most of the time but the point is that it happens which we can't prevent car accidents but we can decrease them.  And for coverage for your car like insurance cost sometimes a lot of money it really depends on the insurance company and the benefits from that company . but it's worth it and don't text and drive it may cost you a lot of money or your life it's important to keep your eyes on the road at all times and to pay attention from crashing or getting crashed into .We have highway patrol and police with speeding guns to prevent crashes people cause by speeding or not paying attention . We also have cameras to catch these things that cause accidents and they work most of the time but doesn't reduce accidents . And checkpoints for people who are under the influence and who are intoxicated and who drunk driving . These are some fact to provide evidence that texting and driving is dangerous and has killed people and some things that prevent it .       		0
In the world that we live in now, many people use cars to get around like getting to work, schooling, and some just go for fun, or the experience of it. In our world, these vehicles are causing a very big issue in our lives. Cars are not great for our environment, without them we would be able to be more ecofriendly, be healthier, and keep eachother more safe. Cars are not the only way to get around!  Using cars may help up get around more often, but notice how many accidents people get into. Running into someones bumper, not being carefull, and some times even driving under the influence, are all very dangerous ways you can get injured in a car. Vehicles are a way to get around quickly, but imagine being stuck in traffic for hours and only moved a mile because someone was not paying attention and ran into a street light. We were born with feet to walk. Walking short distances to the store, or market, where ever you wish to go is better than being stuck in a pile of reckless drivers. You can get there in a safer mannor than you would if you were to take a car.  There are plenty of way to get around, other than cars suck as bikes, any kind of skateboards, rollerblades, bicycling, there is a whole list. Not only do these help the environment, but they give you a nice workout. Most do it for their health, some to help them achieve a goal. A simple walk to the store, can help with a plethora of thing that are very important to your body. While doing this healthy habit, you get plenty of fresh air, with can reduce stress, and help your body in ways that will give you a feeling a peace in mind.  Lets talk about the world, we know how to stay healthy. Does our world? It cannot take care of itself. The people who live in it are the ones who provide the maintenance. Without using cars, the gas that they realese will not bother our environment. As said in source 1, "Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of green house gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the US." 50%? Thats half! If these gasses continue to damage our environment, our world will be very unclean.  For generations, cars were known to impress. Even now, people still have cars shows, or gatherings to display their vehicles. The better your car was, the more attention you were receiving. On the other hand, many people have chosen to take the better way out of it and find other ways to get out of using them. Car pooling is another option. Not many people do it, but when its is absolutly needed, that is one option. Keeping everyone happy and healthy, including this planet, is a very important thing that we can do.		0
Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:  Working from home or in school, which is better for students? This is a question that has been debated for a long time. Personally, I think it's better to work from home. Here's why.  First of all, it's way easier to access resources when you're at home. You don't have to worry about getting to the library or finding a computer lab. You can just use your own laptop or computer and look up whatever you need. Plus, you can work in your pajamas if you want to! 😴  Another thing is that you can work at your own pace when you're at home. Sometimes in school, you can get stuck on a problem and you don't know how to move forward. But when you're at home, you can take your time and figure it out without feeling rushed. And you can also take breaks whenever you want, like when you need to go get a snack or play with your pet. 🐶  But on the other hand, some people say that it's better to work in school because you can learn from other people. When you're in class, you can ask questions and get help from your teacher or other students. And you can also learn from other people's ideas and perspectives. It's like a big brainstorming session! 💡  However, I think that's not always the case. Sometimes, you can learn more from working on your own because you can focus better. And you can also learn new things on your own time, like when you're bored or have nothing else to do. 🤔  In conclusion, working from home is better for students because it's easier to access resources and you can work at your own pace. But working in school can be better too because you can learn from other people. So, it's not really better or worse, it's just different. 🤷‍♀ ?  I hope that helps! Let me know what you think. 🤔		1
Dear principal, I STUDENT_NAME a student in SCHOOL_NAME do not like your opinion in the new policy . The grade doesn't mater in sports or in talent . The grades shouldn't matter because they don't belong in sports. What if you wanted to play a sport in your school but you have low grades and cant play , how would you feel ? Well i would feel not important and not valuable. I really like that sport but cant play it because of my grades . Its not fair that only people with good grades or a b average can play sports . What if I was one of the best soccer players and I have a c average , would you let me play or would you let the soccer team loose in all of the games , and be named the worst soccer team in Texas. Or would you leave the policy as it is. Not change anything and let me play ,and make the soccer team win, and be named the champions because we always win in all of the games .		0
Extracurricular activities play a large part in any student's middle school career. Whether it is sports, music, yearbook, or art club, extracurricular activities help shape students, as well as their futures. I feel that all middle school students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.  Extracurricular activities give students opportunities to make friends and develop their social skills. Clubs and activities expose students to new people they may have never met otherwise. Meeting different people and working together with them helps prepare middle schoolers for life in the real world. In life after middle school you meet new people almost every day. Being able to work well with people, whether it is on a science project or a business pitch, is an essential life skill. Having experience with these skills will help students go far in life.  Being part of an community is a very large part of students well being. When students feel as thought they have no one to be there for them, their mental health can be affected. Extracurricular activities make students feel like they are part of a community. Another way extracurricular activities benefit students is that they can improve performance in school. It has been proven that attendance rates are higher in students who participate in extracurricular activities then in student who do not. Being a part of a team and community helps motivate students to do their best and strive for success.  When student join extracurricular activities they not only work with new people, but they also get a chance to learn more about themselves. An example of this is one of my personal experiences. I had just started middle school. Theatre was one of the electives I was taking. I really enjoyed the class so I decided I would sign up for the upcoming fall play. I new I did not want to be on stage, so I signed up to help with costumes. In the time leading up to the play, I learned so much about myself. I realized how much I loved technical theatre and fashion design. I also learned that you can be a part of theatre without being on stage. Looking back, I am so grateful that I decided to participate in the play. I learned things about myself that I never would have if I had not.  That is why I believe that extracurricular activities should be participated in by all middle school students.  Extracurricular activities provide students a chance to develop social skills and prepare for adulthood while also helping student learn more about themselves. Student get to become a part of a community and expand their knowledge of the world in which we live. 		0
Thier are a bunch of reasons for not using a car I can name you 10 off the top of my head. It limits pollution saves money great excerise their multiple reasons not to drive a car everyday.  For example if you limit your car use to 3 times a week you would save a ton of money. Also you would help get rid of pollution as it states in the article "Pairs bans driving due to smog" that congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france after 5 day of intensifying smog. That happened after five days the smog cleared up enough and they let people start driving again. Also if you limit your car use you could start doing some excersie which is great because the rate of obesity may drop. Also if you limit your self from driving you are less likely to be in a car accident.  In the passage "car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" that they for one whole day dont use cars. They instead ride bikes every where because they want to reduce smog as Pairs wants to. In the passage it says that since its such a big hit that two more colombian cites, Cail and Valledupar joined the event. They have built over 118 miles of bike paths, the most of any latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. It also says that "the rain hasn't stopped people from participating," said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Also that day lets people probaly enjoy life way more because all you can do is ride bike and walk so they probaly go on adventures.  The final reason why you limit car use is their would be less of a chance for you to get hurt or even worse. Thier are many accident evey year because of drunk and reckless drivers many have lost their lives to idiots on the road. Thier was a story on the news that three teenage kids died in a car accident because they where under the influnce of drugs. They could have hurt other people the reporter said they crashed into a store and the store owner almost got hurt. Those kids almost took someone else life which is scary but if you limit your car use their wont be that many accidents.  All in all if you just limit your use of the car you can be helping out a bunch. The pollution can be reduced not as many car accidents you can save your self some money. Also you can get more excersie in if you dont use your car that often.		0
I think that you should let kids use their phones during their free time through out the day. I think this because students still use them anyway so if u let them use it they wont have to hide or worry about getting their phone taken away. The students will also be happy that they can use their phones during their lunch time and other free time they get.  As a kid I like to talk to my friends during the school day. I don't like it when I have to hide from my teachers just so I can use my phone. If you would let us use our phones during school in our free time we would pay more attention in class. We would be paying attention to what the teacher said not to what our friends are saying to us on our cell phones.  I think you should try this policy out for a month to see if it helps students pay more attention and get better grades. If the policy does not work then you can remove it. I think you should try out the policy. It will also stop students from getting in trouble during class for using their phones, it could also get rid of disruptions during the class.  If you do decide to let us use our cell phones during class we might even get better grades on our test's. This is why I think that you should let us students use our cell phones during our free time. I hope that you consider the policy of letting students use their phones during free time.		0
Principal:  I think that bring your phone to school and using them at lunch, break and other free times is a good idea. Because as long as they turn it off at the end of the time giving then there should be no problem. I know you probably think that people would go behind your back and leave there phones on but if they do and they get caught they should get in trouble for it. I really don't see a problem with taken your phone to school and using it at free time.  Also, if they don't obey the rules then they can pay the consequences.  Using phones at school is not no big deal if you think about it. Because we have eight hour in school and I think it is right if you let us use it when free time is giving to us, but not during class time. I know school means a lot but i still think we should get a free time and let us check our phones. School is not a joke, it is important i know that, but i bet you over half of the school checks there phones when they can.  In all, i think students should be allowed to use there phones when they have free time. Education is very important, but remember we have eight hours in school and I don't see any problem checking them at lunch, break or free time. i don't think its right sneaking behind your back and people trying to check there phone so instead of them going behind your back the free time giving to them they can check it.  Thanks,  STUDENT_NAME		0
When you give someone advice you want to give them the best advice you can, right? In my opinion you should give them the best advice you can and if you don't then they can go see someone different. I think that you should try to see multiple people for advice. You should get multiple people's advice because if you only get one person's advice then the information might be bias, what they are telling you might not be correct, and it might be bad advice.  The first reason you should get advice from more than one person is the information might be bias. It might be bias because if are only hearing it from one person and only being told what they want you to know. If you only get advice from one person then you will only know one side of the story and then you wont know if they are right or wrong.  If you get bias information then you might never know the truth or you might not know what actually happened. You shouldn't get bias information because you might not be correct and you might also not know the truth.  The second reason you should get more than one persons advice is that they might not be correct. It might not be correct because you didn't hear from more than one person so then you only know what they think is correct and that might be incorrect. It also might not be correct because you only know what they want you to know so then you cant be sure of what the truth actually is. Your information might be incorrect because you only heard from one person, you only know what they know, and they might not be telling the truth.  Finally, what one person is telling you might just be bad advice. Some time people don't give good advice because they want you to get in trouble or they don't like you. Their advice could be bad because they might not know any better. Their information might be wrong because they might not know better, they may not like you, or they might have been thought that it is the right way when it is actually the wrong thing to do.  In conclusion, if you don't get multiple people's opinions then the information might be bias, it could not be correct, and it may just be bad advice. I believe that getting multiple peoples advice is very important in making an important decision. I think that you should get different peoples information because one persons idea could be different than others might be  		0
When we show positive qualities such as kindness, empathy, and respect through our behavior and actions, we can have a powerful influence on the people around us. By modeling these qualities ourselves, we give others permission to do the same.    For example, I remember growing up with my siblings. If I showed them respect, our interactions were much calmer and more constructive. This taught them to show respect to others and resulted in healthier relationships with our peers.    Another example is volunteering in my local community. Through my actions, I am demonstrating how important it is to help others. This can inspire others to give back to their own community, benefiting society at large.  Ultimately, displaying positive qualities in our behavior and actions can have a ripple effect in our communities for the better. Through our action, we can have the power to shape the lives of those around us in profound ways.		1
The United States has long been a car culture. For many years, owning a car has been seen as a sign of freedom and independence. However, there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. In this essay, I will discuss three of these advantages: reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, and saving money.  One of the most obvious advantages of limiting car usage is that it can help to reduce traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can be very frustrating for drivers. It can also be a major source of pollution. When cars are stuck in traffic, they are burning more fuel and emitting more pollutants into the air. Limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion, which will improve air quality and make it easier for people to get around.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can improve air quality. Cars are one of the major sources of air pollution in cities. When cars are driven, they emit a variety of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These pollutants can cause a number of health problems, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Limiting car usage can help to reduce air pollution, which will improve public health.  Finally, limiting car usage can save money. Cars are expensive to purchase, maintain, and insure. They also require parking, which can be expensive in cities. Limiting car usage can help people to save money on these costs. It can also help them to live a more affordable lifestyle.  In conclusion, there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and save money. If you are interested in reducing your impact on the environment and saving money, I encourage you to consider limiting your car usage.  In addition to the three advantages discussed above, there are a number of other potential benefits to limiting car usage. For example, limiting car usage can encourage people to be more active, as they will be walking or biking more often. This can lead to improved health and fitness. Limiting car usage can also help to reduce noise pollution, as there will be fewer cars on the road. Finally, limiting car usage can promote a sense of community, as people will be more likely to interact with their neighbors when they are not driving.  Overall, there are many potential benefits to limiting car usage. While it may be difficult to change your habits at first, the long-term benefits are worth considering.		1
I think that we should change to popular vote for president of the United States. Instead of the Electorial College. I think this for a lot of reasons, one is because you dont vote for the president but for the electors. It is unfair because they have a winner takes all system. Also if there is a tie the state gets to decide. Electers can defy the will of the people. The electorial college should be changed to popular vote for the president.  First, you have to vote for the electors not the president. Then only if they win there votes go through. You can't even control who the electors vote for. Voters sometimes get confused on who there voting for and vote for the wrong elector. Over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election than what we have now.  Then, they have the winner takes all system. Also candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. Seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. states like Rhode Island, South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even see a campain ad. Though they established electorial college in the constituition Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, agreed on abolishing the electorial college.  Lastly, electers can defy the will of the people. The state legislatures are resposible for picking the electors. If there is a tie between the electors then the state gets to decide. Richard Nixon was presiding over the senate he then validated only his opponent's electors. He made sure to do so without establishing a precedent. What if this possibly happens again?  The electorial college should be changed to popular vote for the president. This should be done because the electorial college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. You also dont vote for the president you vote for the electors. Its also unfair because of the winner takes all system. Also if there is a tie the state gets to vote for the president. The electorial college should be changed to the popular vote for the president, because the electors can defy the will of the people.                          		0
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I believe that this is the only way to ensure that every vote counts and that the President is elected by the will of the people.  The Electoral College is a system that was created in the 18th century, when the United States was a very different country. At that time, the country was much less populous, and travel was much more difficult. The Electoral College was created as a way to ensure that all states, regardless of size, would have a voice in the presidential election.  However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary in the 21st century. The country is now much more populous, and travel is much easier. As a result, it is now possible for every voter to have their voice heard in the presidential election.  There are several reasons why I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. First, the Electoral College is undemocratic. In the 2000 presidential election, for example, Al Gore won the popular vote by more than 500,000 votes, but he lost the election because he won fewer electoral votes than George W. Bush. This is simply unacceptable in a democracy.  Second, the Electoral College gives disproportionate power to small states. In the Electoral College, each state is awarded a number of electoral votes equal to the number of its members in Congress. This means that a voter in Wyoming has three times as much power as a voter in California. This is unfair and undemocratic.  Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a small number of "swing states." This means that candidates ignore most of the country, including entire states. This is not in the best interests of the country.  I believe that the best way to elect the President of the United States is by popular vote. This would ensure that every vote counts and that the President is elected by the will of the people. I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President by popular vote.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1

Drivers Should Not Use Cell Phones in Any Capacity While Operating a Vehicle  In today's society, cell phones have become nearly ubiquitous. They provide tremendous convenience and connectivity. However, cell phones can also pose serious safety risks if used improperly, such as while driving. There are several compelling reasons why drivers should not be permitted to use cell phones in any capacity when operating a vehicle.  The most important reason is that cell phone use severely distracts drivers from paying full attention to the road. Whether dialing a number, texting, or talking, a cell phone pulls the driver's eyes and mind away from their primary responsibility - safely navigating the vehicle. Numerous studies have shown that distracted driving from cell phone use is just as dangerous as if not more so than drunk driving. It delays reaction time, decreases awareness of surroundings, and takes attention away from important driving tasks like checking mirrors and blind spots. This kind of distracted driving puts not only the user but also other innocent drivers and pedestrians at risk.  In addition, cognitive distraction from a cell phone conversation prevents full focus on changing road conditions like sudden stops or lane changes from other vehicles. Operating a vehicle requires making quick decisions under constantly shifting circumstances. A cell phone compromises this ability and delays the driver's processing of visual and audio cues needed for safe navigation. Statistics show cell phone use is a leading factor in car accidents nationally. These crashes have seriously injured or killed many people each year who could have been saved if cell phones weren't in use.   Drivers may feel they can multitask and drive safely while using a phone. However, extensive research confirms cell phone use, in any manner, leads to impairments similar to if not greater than drinking and driving. Despite good intentions, human cognition has inherent limits, and operating heavy machinery requires full attention on the road. With so much at stake - human lives as well as medical and legal costs of crashes - it is not worth the risk to allow cell phone use behind the wheel. For public safety, the only completely responsible policy is a total ban on handheld and hands-free cell phone use for drivers. Overall road safety should be the top priority, above personal convenience or perceived multitasking ability, when it comes to operating motor vehicles.  In conclusion, while cell phones have become a necessity of modern life, they should have no place in vehicles except for true emergencies. Numerous scientific studies confirm that cell phone use, regardless of method, significantly compromises safe driving. To protect drivers, passengers, and other road users, the best approach is prohibiting any cell phone operation by drivers. Lives depend on keeping full attention focused where it belongs - on the road.		1

I will need to have a strong financial situation to back up my business plans, as well as learn the ins and outs of the industry. To overcome these obstacles, I plan to save money, network with other entrepreneurs, and build relationships with potential investors.  Successful entrepreneurs have achieved great things, such as building innovative companies and creating jobs. By achieving my goal, I can also create positive change in the world. Not only will I make a difference, but I will also be able to promote my own ideas and benefit from the financial rewards of being a successful entrepreneur.		1
 Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are technological innovations that have the potential to transform the way we travel and live. These cars rely on advanced sensors, cameras, algorithms, and artificial intelligence (AI) systems to navigate roads and highways, operate without human intervention, and provide a safer and more efficient transportation experience.  One of the major advantages of driverless cars is their ability to reduce accidents caused by human error. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), human error is a factor in up to 94% of all car accidents. With driverless cars, the risk of human error is minimized, and the vehicles become safer for passengers and other drivers on the road. In addition, driverless cars can also reduce the time spent on the road, by allowing for more efficient routing and minimizing traffic congestion.  Another potential benefit of driverless cars is their ability to improve accessibility for people who are unable to drive, such as the elderly, the disabled, and those with limited mobility. With driverless cars, people who are unable to drive can still travel independently and with greater ease, providing them with greater independence and autonomy.  However, despite these benefits, there are also concerns and challenges associated with the deployment of driverless cars. For example, there are concerns about the safety and reliability of the technology, as well as the potential for job displacement and the impact on urban development. Additionally, there are also concerns about the cost of implementing and maintaining these vehicles, as well as the potential for increased fuel consumption and emissions.  In conclusion, while driverless cars have the potential to transform the way we travel and live, there are still many challenges and considerations to be addressed before they can become a reality. However, if we can overcome these challenges, the widespread adoption of driverless cars could have a significant impact on our transportation systems, our cities, and our overall way of life.		1
Driverless cars are the future for daily travel. Driverless cars have a great potential for the future, they have been on the rise of development and new and more productive ways are being introduce to make the cars. These cars are the future for travel because of their ability to copy the skill of human drivers, their potential for new ways of being made, and for the ability to let the driver take charge of the situation.  Driverless cars have been devoleped to be able to copy the ability of human drivers through multiple sensors and laser technology. In the article its stated "...far better response and control than a human driver could manage" the article is talking about the advancement in just the brakes of cars, with the technology already presented, cars that are able to copy the skills of humans and possibly even have more skill and control of the road than humans already do. Sensors along the car allow the car to view the streets and obstacules like a human does, and the addition for even more sensors just expanes the vision of a car, allowing the car to have more knowledge of the street and possible dangers that are ahead.  New technologies are always being manufactured and produced, as well as the advancement of driverless cars. Some cars that are in the market or in the road now even have the technology to warn the driver of any potential dangers, traffic, and many others. In the text it talks about how smart roads were a possiblity for the advancements of cars, that still may be possible with the advancements being made in sensors and radio wave technology. Smart streets and smart cars can work together to develop the future for everyday travel.  As advanced cars can become and how extraordinary then can be, humans with always be needed. Modern day cars now have the potential for being perfectly driverless, but still need the help of humans to help the car manuver itself through tricky areas. Smart cars now a days just don't the technology for the perfection of driverless driving, but they're still be to function without the need for a driver over must normal areas. Cars that aren't able to go ahead without the help of a human driver have the technology to warn or advice the driver for when to to be alert and ready to drive, as stated in the text "In 2013, BMW announced the development of Traffic Jam Assistant".  Driverless cars will greatly change the future, and everyday travel. The ideas and advancements in the car industry will make that possible. Driverless cars will be the step that takes us into the future of this world, by their ability and technology to be able to copy the skills of humans, as well as their potential for how they are constructed and made and the new technologies that are invented , and the option to let the driver actually take control of the car whenever need, these are all the advancements and ways that driverless cars will be the future of everyday travel. As the world progresses driverless car will be a daily part of life then. 		0
Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For this essay, I'm gonna talk about my buddy Generic_Name and how they improved their grades. 📚  So, Generic_Name and I have been friends for like, forever, and we're always trying to help each other out. Last semester, they were struggling with their grades, but then they came up with two super cool strategies to boost their marks. 💡  First, they started using flashcards to help them remember important stuff for their tests. Like, they would write down all the vocab words from our English class on flashcards and quiz themselves every day. It was like, totally working! They got way better at remembering the words and their grades went up too. 📈  The second strategy they used was to make a study group with me and some other friends. They would come over to my house every week and we would all study together. It was so helpful because we could help each other out and ask questions when we didn't understand something. Plus, it was way more fun than studying alone! 🎉  When I looked into what factors affect student success in school, I found out that having good relationships with teachers and classmates is super important. So, I think Generic_Name's approach to success is way better than mine because they're always trying to make friends with their teachers and classmates. Like, they'll go out of their way to be nice to everyone and make them feel welcome. It's really cool! 😎  On the other hand, my approach to success is more like, "Hey, I'm gonna do my thing and hope for the best." 😅 I don't always try to make friends with my teachers or classmates, but I should definitely start doing that more. It's important to have people in your corner who can help you out when you need it.  Anyway, I think Generic_Name's strategies are way more effective than mine, but it's cool that we both have different approaches to success. And hey, even though we're different, we're still friends and we still		1
First impressions are often based on superficial judgments and can be influenced by factors such as appearance, body language, and initial interactions. However, these initial impressions can change over time as we get to know someone better. This essay will explore the idea that first impressions can change after getting to know someone and provide personal experiences and factual evidence to support this opinion.  Personally, I have experienced this phenomenon multiple times. For example, when I first met my best friend, I thought she was quiet and reserved. However, as we spent more time together, I realized that she was actually very outgoing and had a great sense of humor. Similarly, when I first started working at my current job, I assumed that my boss was strict and unapproachable. However, over time, I got to know him better and realized that he was actually very friendly and approachable.  Research also supports the idea that first impressions can change after getting to know someone. A study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley found that people tend to overestimate the differences between themselves and others based on first impressions. This means that our initial judgments about someone can be influenced by factors such as appearance, body language, and initial interactions, leading us to make incorrect assumptions about their personality and behavior.  Another study conducted by the University of Chicago found that people's first impressions of others can be influenced by their own biases and assumptions. For example, if someone has a strong bias against people from a certain ethnic group, they may make negative first impressions of someone from that group based on their appearance or other superficial factors, even if they don't actually know the person.  In conclusion, first impressions can change after getting to know someone. Personal experiences and factual evidence both support this idea. It is important to remember that our initial judgments about someone can be influenced by factors such as appearance, body language, and initial interactions, leading us to make incorrect assumptions about their personality and behavior. By getting to know someone better, we can overcome these biases and form more accurate and positive impressions of them.		1
Although some say that the students should complete summer projects because some of them want to learn more and to prepare for a good future, actually the students should not complete summer projects because some of them want to have vacations, relax their mind and out to visit their families.  The first reason that the students should not complete summer projects is because some of them want to have vacation and they want to have a break in the summer. They get tired because they go to school everyday/every week in the morning and their body need to relax, need a break because some of them work in the night and they arrive to their home very night like around 12:00am and they sleep a little bit. So that's why some of them get tired to school, some of them does not want to do anything in the school because they are tired and they don't have enough energy in their body. However, they need to have vacations in the summer, sleep more and get more energy.  The second reason that the students should not complete summer projects is because they need to relax their mind, they need to forget everything about homework, about school and relax their mind because if they don't relax their mind they would be worried about every homework and they don't relax their mind. Also, some student could get in a big deppression by worrying about everything in school, more if they are working in the afternoon, they could die. So, they need to relax their mind and forget about everything in school.  The third reason that the students should not complete summer projects is because some of them want to out with their families, friends or to visit their families that are far away. Some of them wants to travel to another country or place and that is the only opportunity that they can go in the summer, some of their families are far away and they want to visit them because maybe they don't see them a long time ago, and they need to travel to another place to relax and have vacations. Visit their friends or out with them because the majority of students want to out with their families or friend like a group and have fun with them.  The conclusion is that every body/ every student need to have vacation in the summer and not go to school because they need to relax their mind and get more energy for their body, they need to have a break and out with other people to another place or country and have a lot of fun. 		0
there are many thing in life people want and need such as money, families and fame. but what people dont understand is that most of what they want is stuff they dont need and they would be better off without it. cars are beginning to be something people dont need. all it is doing is causing more problems then solutions. Major people are starting to notice,presidents and governments, and are acting apon it. limiting car usage would bring a lot of advantages such as more pocket money, more excrises and less harm to the earth acorrding to Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota by Andrew Selsky, Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer and the end of car culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal.  Cars are defined as a motor veshel that provides fast transportation for more then one person at a time. thats what most people veiw it as, what that dont know and relize is that it give people a lot more stress to deal with because of either car payments, repairs, or even runing out of gas. acorrding to Heidrun Walter in the passage in german suburb, life goes on without cars she said that when she had a car she was always tense and now that she doesnt have a car sge is more relaxed and is better off without it. she doesnt have to pay for insurance, car payments, repairs on the car and not even gas. that will leave her with a lot of stress free moments.  cars do not only stress out people but they are pulloting the earth. almost all cars run on gas which is put in the car and releases pollution into the earth. paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution.... that is how much damage it is doing to the earth. it took five days the smog finally rivaled beijing, china which is know as one of the most pullated cities in the world. this could have made people go to the hospital because they could have gotten sick or even die from the pollution. many countries are banning cars for a couple of days each year because of this global problem. according to carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota in colombia they have a program that bans cars a for a day which leaves people to walk, hike or even bike to where they need to go. its a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution said carlos arturo plaza.  furthermore not only does it help the envirment for limting car usage and gives relief to peopl. it will also make people healther because they would then have to walk, ride or hike to work or any other place thay need to go. this will strength peoples bodies by doing everyday things more often. it would require more work to walk to a destiantion rather then to sit down in a car and press on the brake and gas pedal with our foot. limting car usage will not only make people helthier but it will make people less lazy. for example if a person was lazy and had no food in hisher house they would just easly get in there car and drive to a local fast food restruant to get food. on ther other hand if they did not have a car they would have to walk all the way to the grocery story burning off lots of caliores and buying lots more food rather then stoping at a fast food place just to get a quick meal.  in clonclusion limting car usage would be a more beifical thing to do rather then a problem due to the stress reilf, envimental saftey and healther citzens.		0
Dear Principal,   I am writing to you regarding the proposal to require all students to perform community service. While helping our community is certainly a noble goal, I do not think mandatory service is the best approach.   Requiring community service risks having the opposite of the intended effect. If students feel like they are being forced into these activities, they may go through the motions without really caring about the cause or those they are helping. True community service should come from a place of personal motivation and care for others, not obligation. Students who do not want to participate may half-heartedly go through the motions without sincere commitment to making a positive impact. This would not truly benefit either the community or the students' development.   Instead of making service mandatory, I think cultivating a culture of volunteerism through encouragement and opportunities would be more effective. Provide students with meaningful options to get involved with causes they find meaningful. Recognize and reward those who give their time, but do not punish those who do not. This will inspire more genuine participation from those who are passionate and allow others to contribute in their own way if and when they feel ready.  Promoting community service as a choice, not a chore, is more likely to foster lifelong habits of civic participation and compassion. Students will be more inclined to continue volunteering after graduation if they develop these values through their own motivated experiences, not because they had to log a certain number of hours. Overall, encouraging volunteerism through leading by positive example, not coercion, will better serve both our students and the community in the long run.  Thank you for considering my perspective. I believe cultivating volunteer spirit through inspiration, not obligation, is the best approach. Please let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of my response.  Sincerely, [Your name]		1
Many cars haven't been use in different countries , some cars have just been ban for cerain reasons. Many says its from reason of pollutionin the air of the streets of paris. There have been many others some streets in the area are not allowing cars in the zone so they are car free zone. The smog made many affects towards the area , it created bike paths , side walks replacement. Diesel gas vehicles made the most polluted smog in each area  Car ownerships have been making a big deal about large parking garages for the development which also comes with a home for $40,000. French and swiss borders Vauban's streets are completely car free zones. More then about 70% percent of the Vauban's families do not own cars. Which also leads to 57% percent of them sold a car to move into the local area. Most of the women and children use bicycle to travel around the area to get to place to place. The sitiuation got so bad that 12% percent of the passengers cars were responsible for greenhouse gas emission in Europe. And 50% percent of some car intensive areas in the united states. Many people tried to make an effort for the past two decades to make the cities denser.  Developments have started to change since world war II , David goldbreg made efforts for the transportation for america amd fast growing coalition of hundreds of groups. In New york suburbs with out spread out homes and private garages were the dreams town of the 1950's and still exert a strong appeals. Why did paris ban driving ? after days of the pollution recorded nears to high rates to a danger zone. The pollution causes motorists to leave their automobile at home or get fined 22 euro ($31),many reports were saying almost 4,000 drivers have been fine because they chose to drive their cars. The smog congestion was down to 60% percent because beijing,china was one of the biggest cities with most polluted cities in the world.  Diesel fuel was one of the worst ways to travel around with ,because it causes alot more pollution,diesel makes up to 67% percent of vehicles in france compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western europe according to reuters. The smog created a car free day , the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital ofcity of seven million. Many violaters faced a $25 fines, municipal authorities from others countries came to bogota , improvements campaign in the mid 1990's. The smog also created a 118 mile paths for most latin american city according to Mockus,the city mayor. Some sidewalks have been replaced by broad .\, smooth sidewalks, rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.  President Obama ambitious goals to curb the united states greenhouse gas emissions unveiled. America adjusted the population growth, the number of driven miles in the united states peaked in 2005 anmnd dropped steadily. By the many measures the decrease preceded the downturn and appear to be persisting now that will be recovered under way. Over the years driving has been decreasing because of the polluted areas in other countries. But many citizens refused to ride bike or take buses for transportation. So the causes has everyone to end of the car culture.          		0
All students want to enjoy their long awaited summer vacation to the fullest. Schools; however, feel that it is necessary for students to complete summer assignments to ensure that they do not forget what they learned over the summer. With the help of these projects, students will be better prepared for the topics that they will learn in the upcoming school year. The schools entrust the duty of designing these projects to the teachers because of their experience, but that does not mean that they know how to make the projects fit for the students. Knowing what works best for the students is up to the students and the students alone. Summer projects should be student designed because they will have more interest in their work, they will learn to be more independent, and the students will have a less stressful break.  Some argue that summer projects should be teacher designed because they know much more about the course than the students. An English teacher, that will be teaching students about the Age of Reason, assigns her students books that were written from that time and reflect those ideas. The books chosen by the teacher will help introduce her students to their new course. However, the students have no interest at all in the books that were assigned to them, and they have no will to read them since it is summer break. It is painful to finish a book that one is not interested in before a deadline. Their summer is ruined by pushing through these books, but if the students choose their books, they will be more inclined to read them.  Summer projects should be student designed because the assignments will be more interesting for them to complete. For world history class, the students assign themselves a project to write about any event in world history and show its significance. By choosing their own event, the students can figure out what topic interests themselves the most. The project is not designed to work best for the entire class, but to be specific to the interests of each individual student. The students understand each other the most, and they know how summer projects make them feel. They know how to make summer projects more productive over the summer. The for people to design projects will help them become more independent.  Summer assignments should be student designed because they help students become more independent people. A student is given the opportunity to create his projects meant for him during the summer, and he learns to complete work specific to him all on his own. When the project is designed by the student and for the student, that is the only person that knows how that project should be completed. He alone reaches success through the process of designing and finishing his own work. By creating his projects at a young age, he learns to rely more on himself, and he will become much more successful in the future. When the project is designed, the students also plans it to create a less stressful summer for themselves.  Summer projects should be student designed because their summer will be less stressful with assignments that they know more of. A student decides to write an essay on the impacts of the Roaring Twenties, her favorite time period, so she is able to plan when which parts of the essay will be completed and go at her own pace. Since she is the designer of the project, she understands how long the essay will take her. She enjoys working on this essay more because it is a topic that she likes, so it will not feel like it is work to her. Her time will not be spent dreading the assignment and stressing over a deadline all summer; rather, she will have more fun and work with a more relaxed environment with a project meant for her.  Assignments created by the students for summer vacation are more beneficial than assignments made by the teachers because students will be more invested in their projects, they form more self directed lives, and experience a more relaxed vacation. With projects that draw the attention of the students, they do not feel that it is work that they are just being forced to do. Their designing of the projects gives them the same benefit of learning without the cost ruining their break. It is up to the students to take the responsibility of advocating for this change in summer assignments. They can gain the support of their fellow students to reach out to their county Board of Education through letters and board meeting to express the need for change.		0
Venus is a planet that is similiar, in certain ways, to earth. Earth and Venus both orbit the sun and Venus can be spotted from Earth. In this story, The author supports the idea of Venus exploration with great ideas and facts to support his claims. The authour says how visiting Venus could be both good and bad for humans and gives great reasoning on both point of views. The author never gives their opinion on the subject, but instead gives the reader reasons for both sides of the arguement.  In paragraph 3, the author says how Venus has a very dangerous atmosphere and supports that by saying that the clouds in the atmosphere are full of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. He says how the planets average temperature is over 800 degrees fahrenheit. The authour uses those facts to support the claim that those conditions are far more extreme than any human can withstand. In paragraph 4, he then goes on to say that long ago, Venus could have possibly been the closest thing to earth, being covered with oceans, valleys, and craters, possibly being able to support various life forms. He explains NASA? idea of a bimp like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the planets atmosphere for closer exploration, although the temperatures would still be very harsh.  The author ends off the writing by aying that humans must meet the challenges of Venus in order to conquer space exploration. Human curiosity could possibly come back araund and hurt us in the end, but we must know whats out there in case our planet is no longer inhabitable. He closes the story by saying that our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited, but we should exceed them in order to be great.		0
The debate between a hard working attitude and a positive attitude is one that has been pursued for ages. While it is true that positive thinking can yield many rewards, most would agree that possessing a hard working attitude is often much more beneficial in achieving success in life. Success requires dedication, perseverance and hard work, and a hard working attitude will provide these traits when facing any challenge.   Having a hard work attitude allows an individual to take action and turn ambition into reality rather than feelings of lofty aspirations. A hard working attitude involves taking personal responsibility, setting meaningful goals, and putting the necessary amount of effort and time towards arriving at the desired outcome. It fosters a sense of relentless determination in spite of failure and requires strength of character and an unwillingness to give up.   A hard worker will also be more accountable for their failures and successes. They will strive to learn from their mistakes and seek to improve on them, rather than simply making excuses and blaming external forces. This is the kind of attitude that will ultimately be beneficial for any individual striving to reach their goals in life.  Ultimately, having a hard working attitude is essential for self-improvement and advancement, which are essential components in achieving success in life. Possessing a hard working attitude will allow an individual to continue to strive for excellence and be rewarded with accomplishments they can be proud of. A hard working attitude will provide the commitment and dedication that is necessary in order to reach any goal.		1
Because Venus has all proprties that humans requied to inhabit.  Also, Venus had an extremely temperatures that humans can't survived.  As the author said "the temperature of Venus pass the 170 degress fahrentheid", this means that humans can't resist this temperatures.  Years ago scientist fund something interesting in Venus but also dangereous, venus can be inhabit???, how we can travel to Venus???  Also the Nasa do programs to send people to Venus and study the ecosism.  Venus the secund planet of the solar sistem. Scientis fund that Venus maybe can be inhabit, because they fund properties that Earth posees. But now Venus is like pangea, a dangerous planet with dangerous gasees, earthquakes, etc.  and now, the humanity want to know how to lived in Venus.  Venus is a planet that we can study, survived etc. But also it take a lot of time to do programs and prepare the people, also we are close to put the first step on Venus.  thank you....		0
My agrument for this passage is that although theses cars seem to be really nice and might help save people from accidients and save money they may not be the best option. Driving is a very serious thing and in this agrument I'm going to tell why i think that they shouldn't be made. Driving can always need improvement why not keep the cars we have and help them out and keep people driving what they own. Plus money is a very important aspect in this agrument, having a driveless car can cost lots of money.  People who drive can say that they don't like driving all the time but most can say that they enjoy getting to drive if we have cars that are driveless that takes away the fun that people have. If we make these driveless cars that means that the newer generations with not know how to drive cars. People will not want ot get put as much if we have driveless cars. I don't think that people have the money to spend on these cars to drive them so we may have lots of people walking if we were to switch to these cars.  If driveless cars are made they is a very big possibility that people will not want to pay attention to the roads and that will cause more accidents than what there already is. Even though the drive is suppose to watch the road when in the car still doesn't mean that people wont think that the car can do it all on its own. They will not watch the road as much as what they do now and it can cause wrecks that are not needed.  Having drivers have a driveless car is not a good idea because they willl think it is okay to play on their phones and mess around in the car. The car may have antilock brakes but that does not mean that the car is completely save for being accident free. If we have teenagers that are driving in these cars they might think that it is expectable to play around even more than what they do now. Maybe adding things to cra sthat we have now and giving them some newer safety assets might be the solution to our problem. That might be a soultion to our probelm of accidents and it will still allow people to drive.  Another thing to think about is the laws that will have to change for these people to make these cars. Like speed limits and how the car will cars handle traffic in large cities. We alos have to think about if they are really a energy saver car or if it is just as bad as the cars we are using.  In conclusion, I think that this car shouldn't be developed for the reasons of safety. This car may have some very nice aditions to it but we still have to think about whats best for the drivers. The cars that we drive now can use some new technogly but having a driverless care kind of seems a little to extreme. People love driving so why not keep the cars we have today and just keep inproving to make them better for us.  But i feel like before anyone makes thier minds up about whether we should or shouldn't uses these cars that are driverless there needs to be more research done and tests to see how these cars work. 		0
Would you keep your vehicle at home for a day and walk to work? Well in Bogota there is a car-free day, people all over the town partcipate in this event. According to the article, "millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yestraday." On this day only buses and taxis are permitted to rome the streets for the day. The reason behind having a car-free day is because cars cause smog, which can cause congestion in the city.  In Paris, "Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France." Diesel is favored over gasoine because of a tax policy, because of diesel France was polluted with smog. Since France took away the use of cars for evn numbered license plate owners for the day delivery companies complained of "lost revenue," but if you had a "plug-in car, hybrid, or cars carrying three or more passengers" had exceptions. On the next day, odd numbered lisence plate owners were followed to keep their car at home but instead the smog had cleared enough on that Monday for the ruling French to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates.  "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" article they talked about the people walking or bicycling to work or places they wanted to go. Many people might have decided to not take a car to go places because there was limited parking, which only consists of two parking garages. Now, 70 percent of families don't own cars in Vauban, which is shocking because they all either walk or take a bicycle ride.  Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. The United States of America is now responding to these other countries and their way to reduce car usage. Obama ambitious gaols to curb the United States greenhouse gas problem might be paying off. The article "The End of Car Culture states "Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by." If Americans are buying less vehicles than that's a way to a good start for lowering greenhouse gases.  In conclusion, limiting car usage can have many advantages. Since caar usage causes greenhouse gases and smog, limiting by a little or alot will always help to reduce the amounts  of these gases in the air that we humans breath. People in differnt countries like France, Germany, and Bogota are coming up with many unique ways to help reduce the car usage. Limiting the car usage helps with the gas expensives, and helps with finding other ways for transportation.         		0
The Electoral College vote draws many emotions. It has many supporters and many enemies. There was a huge debate over the 2000 election where Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College destroys some of the integrity of the american democracy. I believe this is due to the winner takes all system of the Electoral College.  The Electoral College says whoever has the majority of votes in a state receives all that states votes. I believe this corrupts the system because so many peoples votes go unaccounted. If one party has 51 percent of the vote the other 49 percent of the votes don't count. This is why I believe that we need to abolish the Electoral College.  In a true democracy the people vote for a president and the ideal behind the Electoral College is that it eliminates uneducated votes. I believe that it doesn't do this very well and may actually harm the system even more. Peoples votes elect electors who elect the President in the Electoral College system. These electors are put in a spot of significant power. The question is who are these electors. It is very possible that they can vote for the opposite party of that which they were elected to vote for. Scandals like this have occurred in the past what is stopping them form continuing in the future.  Another major problem of the Electoral College is with the winner takes all system if a state is known to be a majority one party or another there is no use for someone in the minority party to vote because they have no effect. This allows citizens who are supposed to help elect Americas leaders to be unable to have any say in the government. The ideal behind a democracy is that the people rule and the Electoral College is destroying the democracy because it is restricting people form taking active participation in what they are entitled too as a citizen. Without the Electoral College there might be some uneducated votes but the popular vote upholds the integrity of the democracy that America thrives on. The popular vote also eliminates the chance of any major scandals that could majorly affect the presidential election.		0
My summer project revolves around discovering ways to treat an open wound without the use of pharmaceuticals or medical treatments. I believe that by researching natural remedies, such as utilizing the healing properties found in certain plants, we can reduce our reliance on antibiotics.   This project could be used in everyday life. For example, a family member or friend that has suffered an open wound could treat it using the natural remedies researched in this project. The remedies could also be useful in developing nations, where medical treatments and pharmaceuticals are often difficult to come by. In addition, the natural remedies could be useful in a natural disaster situation, when access to medical care may be limited.   Overall, this project is about finding safe and non-invasive treatments for open wounds and reducing our reliance on antibiotics.		1
Should students be forced to do an extra activity outside of normal school?  I Believe that kids should be forced to do at least one extra school activity, because doing an activity can be fun, It helps you try new things, and it can be beneficial later on in life.  Doing an extra activity outside of school can be fun.  When being forced to do at least on extra activity, you get to choose which activity you may want to do.  People may say that if you are forced to do an extra activity, you may have to do something you dislike.  But the principal is giving you a choice between different activities, like if someone likes art, they can do art class, or if someone likes sports, they can do a sport.  The point of these activities are to give you something that you enjoy.  Instead of sitting all day after school on the couch, you can be out doing something that can make you a better person.  Being forced to do an extra activity helps you try new things.  When someone is forced to try something new, they will be experiencing new challenges, and they might not realize they really enjoy it.  Some of the pro sports players from every sport were forced to do that sport by a parent or guardian.  If they were not forced to play that sport, they would not realize how good they are at the that sport.  Being forced to try something new can make you a more rounded person as well, which will better you in the future.  Being forced to do an extra activity can benefit you later on in life.  If someone chooses art as their extra activity, and in the class they found out they are really good at drawing, can help you find a job later on in life.  "Trying new stuff is easier when you're still a kid."  Is a quote which means its best to learn new stuff as a kid, when you still have all those years to work on the stuff you want to.  Another example is if you're taking a sport as you extra activity, and you are really good at the sport, colleges will be watching and may want to give you a scholarship because you are really good at that sport.  Doing good in a extra activity, can have a large impact on your future life.  I believe that kids should be forced to do an extra activity outside of school because doing an extra activity can be fun, being forced to try an extra activity helps you try new things, and being forced to do an extra activity can benefit you later on in life.  These are the reasons why I believe that kids should be forced to do at least one extra school activity.		0
Dear Teacher,  I think that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. I know some people might say that dress codes are restrictive and take away our freedom of expression, but I believe that they help create a more focused and respectful atmosphere.  Firstly, dress codes promote equality among students. When everyone wears the same type of clothes, no one stands out or feels left out. For example, if someone wears a fancy dress to school, it might make others feel poor or less important. Dress codes ensure that everyone looks the same, and we don't have to worry about what others are wearing.  Secondly, dress codes help us focus on our studies. When we wear casual clothes, it's easy to get distracted and think about things other than school work. But when we wear uniforms, it's like we're in a workplace, and we know we need to focus on our tasks. It's also easier for teachers to tell who's paying attention and who's not, when we're all dressed in the same way.  Lastly, dress codes are important for safety reasons. Some clothes might have sharp objects or loose strings that can hurt us during physical activities or while playing outside. Uniforms are usually designed to be safe and comfortable, so we don't have to worry about getting hurt.  I understand that some people might think that dress codes limit our creativity and self-expression, but I believe that there are other ways to express ourselves, such as through art, music, or writing. School is a place for learning, and dress codes help us maintain a professional and respectful atmosphere.  In conclusion, I believe that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. They promote equality, focus, and safety, which are all important for a positive learning experience.  Thank you for reading my essay.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
Group collaboration can offer a number of benefits both academically and socially. In terms of academics, working in groups promotes the sharing of ideas and resources, which can improve the quality of the work being done and reduce the overall burden of tasks. For example, a group of students working on a school project can divide the work into manageable amounts, with each member of the group having their own task and accountability for its completion. By doing this, the overall project can be completed much more efficiently than if each student was working on their own.  Socially, working in groups can allow for the development of relationships and networking opportunities. Students can form relationships with their peers and learn how to work effectively as a team. These skills can prove to be invaluable both in and out of the classroom, as they can improve interactions, communication, and teamwork abilities in other aspects of life.  Though working in groups can offer these benefits, it can also pose potential challenges. Not every group member is capable of putting in an equal amount of effort, and a lack of respect for one another’s contributions can lead to inefficiencies or delays in completing the projects. To overcome this, group members should be mindful of giving each other space and voice, and be open to productive feedback and compromise. Additionally, establishing clear expectations, goals, and deadlines for the project, and assigning clear roles to each group member, can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that all tasks are completed on time.   In conclusion, working in groups can offer both academic and social benefits, but challenges can arise if adequate measures are not taken to ensure everyone is working together efficiently and respectfully. By fostering communication and understanding within the group, and by establishing expectations and roles, the members of a group can work together effectively to complete a project with the best possible results.		1
The Dangers of Cellphone Usage While Driving  Operating a cell phone or any type of device while driving comes with many risks. Many don't see the consequences that it may bring and use it anyway. Studies have proven that most car accidents are due to use of a device while driving. Many may believe it's not that serious but in reality it is. Therefore, should operating a device while driving be banned?  To continue, using a mobile device while driving increases the risks of a car accident.  Stephen Corby has an article, "Why you really shouldn't use your mobile phone while driving" here, he compares the usage of a mobile device while driving to driving with your eyes closed or reading a book while driving. "Frankly, using mobile phone while driving, is such a stupid cause of death that, before the advent of the cell phone it would only have been comparable with reading a book while driving or closed eyes while driving." Corby makes a pretty great comparison here. The amount of time you take to pick up your device and see who is calling you or texting you is enough time to get off the lane. While driving you should have full attention on the road. Although it is tempting to use your device try considering a longer life for yourself or someone else on the road.  Furthermore, driving requires one's full attention. Most of the time accidents aren't caused by one but instead someone else on the road. One could be perfectly driving and paying full attention but then another one can come maybe drunk or using a phone and come crash into the other. In scenes like these is where maybe if you weren't on your device you could've seen the other coming. In many occasions this has been the cause of accidents. Using a mobile device behind the wheel just takes your attention off the road even if it may be for seconds. One should always have their full attention on the road. It's more likely to prevent accidents from happening if your full attention is on the road and not on what is happening in your phone.  Therefore, the usage of a mobile device while driving is prohibited now.  "HANDS FREE LAW" is the law passed by our recent governor Nathan Deal. The law has been taking place since July of 2018. HFL prohibits a driver from occupying a phone behind the wheel. The driver must not have a phone in their hand or any part of their body to support their phone. A driver can not send messages nor read them. A drive can not watch a video or record a video while driving. There are exceptions into using a phone but those are only when reporting a crash, or another emergency. The law does not apply when the driver is parked. Breaking the law can cause one to have consequences such as a fine of $50 for the first time, $100 for the second, and  $150 for the third, each time points get taken away from your license which could reach the point where your license will be suspended.  In conclusion, being distracted while driving can cause fatal crashes or other consequences. There are a series of reasons why one might pick up a device behind the wheel and to think to themselves it could be an emergency but even that split second of attention into the device can become a lethal end based on one decision and curiosity. It's better to avoid and prevent something bad from happening than to continue to test it until it does. Usage of a mobile device while driving should not be allowed. And as stated in the 4th paragraph it is prohibited, it is a law. Let's set full attention on the road and be the smart drivers.  Works Cited  Anderson, Peter, et al. "Why You Really Shouldn't Use Your Mobile Phone While Driving." CarsGuide, www. carsguide. com. au/car-advice/why-you-really-shouldnt-use-your-mobile-phone-while- driving-33062.         		0
It's illegal to drive with a phone and its multiple why you can't drive without a phone. A cell phone is a one second distraction taking your eyes off the road increases the risk of crashing. You can say it's like driving while intoxicated. It puts innocent lives at risk. It put your life at risk. It is comparable to, if not worse than driving under the influence. You are setting a bad example for your children.  Drivers should not have cell phones the accidents rate over the past years has been high people be on their phone so much and get distracted when you get a message I'm pretty sure you more focused on the message more than the rode. You see some interesting like on facebook or any other website you'll get so interested and forget you're driving that's how much a phone can get your attention.  I can honestly say it a cause for people to lose their life because I've been involved. My grandmother was talking on the phone it was a self-hand just to end and answer the phone that lil second caused an accident she hit someone from the back don't never think you have the sense to avoid an accident well you don't.                                  		0
Dear Principal,  I think that students should go perform community service. It will give these students a good education and idea or what he or she would like to do in life. Weather is would be tutoring elementary school children, or help clean up liter for the Earth to become a better planet. Community service would be a thing to get your mind off of things. And if you have a sport you could go after that sport, or before that sport to perform community service. If I were you, I would let the students choose for them selves. If i was in this position I would choose to do community service to get to know a little about what i am learning. Our community is very important for helping our environment by cleaning up and recycling everything that needs recycled. Education is good it will show you what you want to do before you start you job you went to college for.		0
As an average 8th grade student, I have to say that I find the prompt to be really interesting. In my opinion, there are many ways to influence someone without using technology, Google translator, or YouTube. While these tools can be useful in some situations, they are not the only ways to make an impact on someone's thoughts or actions.  One way to influence someone without technology is through personal interactions and communication. For example, having a face-to-face conversation with someone can be much more effective in persuading them than sending them a message through a screen. This is because nonverbal cues, such as body language and tone of voice, can convey emotions and sincerity in a way that text messages cannot. Additionally, building a personal connection with someone can make them more likely to listen to and consider your perspective.  Another way to influence someone without technology is through shared experiences and common interests. For instance, if you and someone else have a common hobby or passion, you can use that as a way to connect with them and share your ideas. By finding common ground, you can build trust and credibility, which can make it easier to persuade them to see things from your perspective.  However, I do think that technology and other tools can also be useful in certain situations. For example, if you are trying to reach a large audience or spread awareness about an issue, using social media or other online platforms can be an effective way to do so. Additionally, technology can provide valuable information and resources that can help support your arguments.  In my opinion, the impact of examples vs. other ways of influencing depends on the situation and the audience. While personal interactions and shared experiences can be more effective in some cases, technology and other tools can be more useful in others. For example, if you are trying to reach a large audience or spread awareness about an issue, using social media or other online platforms can be more effective than trying to have personal conversations with each person individually.  Overall, I think that there are many ways to influence someone without using technology, Google translator, or YouTube. While these tools can be useful in certain situations, they are not the only ways to make an impact on someone's thoughts or actions. By using a combination of personal interactions, shared experiences, and technology, you can be more effective in your efforts to		1
We should change the Electoral College to election by popluar vote. As its states in the text "The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational." When you vote for a president, your actually voting for a state elector. It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote wont win the national popular vote, but that happens rarely. Over 60% of voters would prefer direct elections.  Voters doesnt vote for the president in the electoral college, they actually vote for the slate of electors. Wouldnt you want to vote for the persident you want except voting for the electors? Its unfair that some states has more representatives than others because if its up to to the representatives big states, such as California has 55 representatives which represent 35 million voters. So as a example if the votes are tied and its up to Wyoming and California to decide who is president, Obama or Romney, and if California representatives voted for Romney, then even if Wyoming representatives voted for Obama, Romney would of won.  They should let us (citizens of America) vote for president except for the electors. In my personal opinion, there would be a higher amount of votes per president. It'll be fair if the president would be elected by the most popular votes. The president that has thhe most votes should be the one who wins it all.    		0
Phones and Driving  Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.  Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.  Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.  Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.  Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.   		0
Dear Principal,   I am writing to express my views regarding the proposed policy change to require students to have at least a B average in order to participate in sports and extracurricular activities. While I understand the goal of motivating academic performance, I do not think imposing this restriction is the best approach.  Requiring a B average would discourage many students who currently maintain a C average. These students work hard in their classes as well as in sports and clubs. Excluding them could damage their motivation to continue pursuing multifaceted achievements. Participating in extracurricular activities plays an important role in many students' personal and academic development. It allows them to complement their classroom learning with other skills, explore interests, and take breaks that recharge their focus and productivity. Removing this outlet could negatively impact students' well-being and performance.   A better approach might be to provide academic support for students whose grades are close to the target, rather than punishment. For example, study sessions could be made mandatory for those with averages below a B-. This offers guidance without removing incentives and opportunities. It also allows students who put in sincere effort to continue their involvement with encouragement.   In conclusion, while the goal of higher academic achievement is important, outright exclusion may do more harm than good. A policy of conditional participation combined with assistance seems a fairer way of motivating students that does not penalize sincere participation or work. I hope you will consider a more nuanced alternative to the proposed change. The well-rounded development of all students should be the top priority.  Thank you for considering my views. Please let me know if any part of this proposal needs further explanation. I would be glad to discuss this issue further.  Sincerely, [Your name]		1
Hi my names Kaigen and I am against the idea of self driving vehicles. I honestly think it would cause more mayham. Just think about it, what if a deer runs out in front of your car. I know you are probably thinking they have some fool proof plan to avoid these incidents, but take out that word deer and replace it with a child. Yeah that changes things up a little huh. No matter how fool proof they claim their "self driving" cars are it a bad idea. Things happen, technology fails. Its a part of life.  The story even says 'the driver has to take control entering or leaving a driveway', or "if theres road work it needs the driver to take over". This is not ok. What happens when you are going through an intersection and the light turns red? Is the car going to speed up, or stop in the middle of the road. What if you are going through a school zone? Hows the car going to know any different? They also said in the article "for this to work it would be espensive". In my opinion the last thing we need is to go even further in debt. Yes I can see good in this idea, but i beleive the bad over rules the good in this instinse. Just imagine what would happen if a car pulled out in front of you, sure these machines will probably have a pretty good reaction time. But it can not be anywhere close to the reaction time of a frightened parent. Child saftey is the number one thing car manufactures need to be worried about. If they get the "okay" and come out with these i would want to see these flaws adressed before anyone puts a child in the vehicle. I am not saying its a bad idea, heck I even seee a time in the future where a car is driving me around. I just dont think they have everything figured out yet and i dont think they will have anytime soon. Its reasonable for these to come out on the market, they just need to meet all of the saftey regulations. I also beleive that if they are going to do the track cars, where they run on tracks like a train, that they would have to rip up every highway, every back road, and evey interstate. This would take a ridiculous amount of time and money. We are talking billions and billions of dollars and possible two or three decades. I am kaigen, and this is why I'm against a vehicle that can "drive itself". Plain and simple they are not safe and would cost far too much to make safe and reasonable.  Sincerly  -Kaigen		0
Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  In recent times, there has been a growing awareness and concern towards the challenges and issues associated with excessive car usage. From cities like Vauban in Germany to Bogota in Colombia, there are examples of communities that have chosen to limit car usage and witnessed significant improvements in the quality of life and environmental conditions (Rosenthal, Selsky). This essay aims to present a compelling case for limiting car usage by highlighting its advantages including reduced greenhouse emissions, improved public health, and enriched community life, drawing evidence from global initiatives.  There is ample scientific evidence that excessive car usage contributes significantly to the global greenhouse gas emissions, thereby fueling the climate change crisis. In fact, passenger cars account for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). Additionally, cities that favor car usage frequently contend with smog and poor air quality, as demonstrated by situations in Paris (Duffer). Prioritizing alternative modes of transport reduces our dependence on cars, contributing substantially to mitigating climate change.   The public health benefits of limiting car usage are substantial. Cities with fewer cars have been shown to have lower levels of air pollution, thereby contributing to improvements in respiratory health among its citizens. This assertion gets further substantiated by the partial driving ban in Paris, which reduced congestion by 60% to contain the smog crisis (Duffer). Moreover, transforming cities to be less car-dependent also promotes physical activity such as walking or cycling, thereby combating sedentary lifestyles, and their associated health concerns such as obesity and heart disease. Bogota's "Day Without Cars" is a testament to this, where millions participated, engaging in physically active modes of transportation (Selsky).   Lastly, reduced car usage fosters enriched community life, leading to quieter, safer, and more vibrant local neighborhoods. The suburb of Vauban in Germany, where 70% of the families do not own cars, is an excellent illustration of this, where the streets echo with the sound of children and bicycles rather than motor engines (Rosenthal). Also, urban design that favours reduction in car usage usually involves allocating more space for parks, social centers and broad, smooth sidewalks, enhancing the infrastructure for community interactions (Selsky).   In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage go beyond environmental protection to include health benefits and enhanced community life. As emphasized by sociologist Mimi Sheller, the trend of America's cooling love affair with vehicles signals a long-term cultural shift (Rosenthal). While it is true that cars can provide convenience and flexibility, it is important to weigh these benefits against the wider societal and environmental impacts. As citizens, it is our collective responsibility to support and advocate for policies and practices that promote alternative modes of transportation, not only for our sake but also for future generations.		1
I believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed. The reason for this is because teachers have a more comprehensive knowledge of what the students should learn and what they need to improve on. Additionally, they have more experience in designing projects that can help students achieve these goals effectively. If students design the projects, they might not be able to cover all the necessary topics or might not be able to create a project that is challenging enough to help them learn and grow.  For example, if a student is struggling in math, a teacher-designed summer project that focuses on the specific areas where the student needs improvement would be more beneficial than a project designed by the student. The teacher can create a project that challenges the student and helps them improve their skills in a structured and effective manner.  Furthermore, teachers can create projects that are aligned with the curriculum and learning objectives of the course. This ensures that the students are learning the necessary material that will prepare them for the next academic year. If students design their own projects, they might not have a clear understanding of what they need to learn and could end up wasting their time on irrelevant activities.  In conclusion, summer projects should be teacher-designed to ensure that students continue to learn and grow during their break. Teacher-designed projects are more effective in addressing the specific areas where students need improvement and are more likely to be aligned with the curriculum and learning objectives of the course.		1
In the picture that you were showen looks like a face on Mars that many people believe was created by Aliens, Scientist call the face "Face of Mars". "Face of Mars" has been a pop icon, it has starred in many films, books, radio shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for over 25 years!  Many people believe this "face" has been created by aliens because of how far it it and how barley visible it is, would this prove that there is Human life on Mars? many people believe that their is human life on mars but some people are skeptics. I truly believe that this is just a natural landform. Some believe, like scientists figure it was rock forming and had unusual shadows that made it look like an illusion with a human head, eyes, nose, and a mouth. Authors have reasoned it is a good way to get attention to mars, which has worked. There are three different photos from seperate years that show a face but you can clearly see the face has slowly dissapeared by 1998, by 2001 the face looks like it has faded slowly. Nasa scientists were starting to dissagree at some point but that is okay, people have there own way of beliveing stuff. Most scientists on Nasa believe it has been natural rock formation over the years, they seem to be pretty positive. most scientists like to keep information to their selves instead of saying infromation to conspiracy theorists which can give false information.  Natural Landforms are common around the American West, it makes more sense to prove that it is just natural rock landform coming together forming rock and the shadow illusion of a face, as scientists predict. As many more years come around there might be more information about the "Face of Mars". 		0
In todays world of technology, not everything made can be trusted. There have been many flaws in the sources of technology that we use today.  One reason why this stands true is the "Driverless Car" was first discovered in movies and television. Taking something from an animated commercial, tv show, or movie and making it into something that we can use in real life could in some situations, be very complicated to do so. How would the car know when and where to come get you? Will they always be reliable? Often, some of todays people can't even trust that their cell phone is going to keep all of their information private. Making it hard to trust developing technology.  In addition, some of the ways that creators have come up with to make this happen is way out of our budget. As said in the section, instead of building "smarter cars" we could invest in building "smarter roads". This means that instead of putting all of the technology just in the car, it would also be included in the road system. This would cost millions, billions, maybe even trillions which is way out of our price range. The nation has too many things to take care of just to put all of our money towards something that we don't absolutely need.  Lastly, how would we know that the sensors built into the vehicle are going to work all the time? How would we trust them? Failed sensors could result in many incidents such as car accidents, fires, or car pile-ups. Even if we do develop the vehicle, we can't always trust it because accidents do happen. Using this car in todays society could risk many lives, even if we're not in the vehicle. Yes, it would be a success for our world of technology to make this happen. But is it really a success for everyone? There's no problem with today system of people driving on their own so why change it.  Ask yourself, do we really need this "Driverless Car" added to todays technology? Will it really benefit us that much? Can we trust every piece of technology handed to us?		0
As an 8th-grade student, I have always been curious about what subjects are taught in elementary school. I believe that understanding the different subjects taught in elementary school can help me become a better teacher in the future. To learn more about this topic, I talked to current teachers about their teaching styles and techniques for engaging students. I also researched how to make lessons interesting and engaging for elementary school students. Additionally, I talked to family members and friends about their elementary school experiences and observed students in an elementary school to see how they interact and learn.  After conducting my research, I found that there are several subjects taught in elementary school, including math, science, social studies, language arts, and physical education. Each of these subjects has its own unique approach to teaching, and teachers use different techniques to engage students. For example, in math, teachers often use visual aids and hands-on activities to help students understand abstract concepts. In science, teachers use experiments and demonstrations to teach students about the natural world. In social studies, teachers use real-world examples and role-playing activities to help students understand historical events and cultural differences. In language arts, teachers use a variety of teaching methods, including reading, writing, and speaking, to help students develop their language skills. Finally, in physical education, teachers use games and activities to help students develop their physical fitness and coordination.  In addition to the different subjects taught in elementary school, teachers also use different techniques to engage students. Some teachers use a direct instruction approach, where they provide clear instructions and examples to students, while others use a student-centered approach, where they encourage students to take an active role in their learning. Some teachers also use technology, such as interactive whiteboards and educational games, to engage students and make lessons more interactive.  To make lessons interesting and engaging for elementary school students, I believe it is important to use a variety of teaching methods and activities. For example, teachers could use games, puzzles, and other interactive activities to help students learn. They could also use real-world examples and role-playing activities to make lessons more relatable and engaging. Additionally, teachers could use technology, such as educational games and interactive whiteboards, to make lessons more interactive and engaging.  In conclusion, I believe that understanding the different subjects taught in elementary school and the techniques used by teachers to engage students can help me become a better teacher		1
Growing up, we have all had to deal with the dreaded summer projects. With everyone rushing at the end of summer trying to finish them before school starts. What if you were given the opportunity to choose your project? The project would be more open to ideas rather than stuck on one topic. Summer projects should be student-designed because it motivates them to get their projects done, it allows students to express their interests, and it betters the all around process as well as the scores. This different approach can bring a whole new side to summer learning.  To begin, making these projects student-designed can motivate the students more than an assigned topic. Most students procrastinate when it comes to projects assigned over summer break because they aren't trilled on the topic or aspect. The last thing they want to do on their break from school is write a paper on a book they don't prefer. By letting the students explore their own ideas, they will put more time and energy into the project rather than brushing it off. However, this isn't the only positive aspect to this approach.  Additionally, students will get to express their interests through their projects. When students get to choose their topics they usually tend to choose things that inspire or interest them. Giving students more room to work with can open their minds to new ideas. By assigning a straight forward project, you are taking away all of the creativity. Naturally, a student will put more thought into something they know more about or care more about. While many people would agree with this idea, it is not always seen this way.  Teachers and adults may say that letting students choose their projects is out of line and a lot of extra work to grade. However, giving the students freedom of expression can better the all around process as well as the grading aspect. They can pick their own topics while still working from the teachers guide lines, making the grading process relatively the same. Grading projects that were more thought out is a lot better than grading poorly done projects that the students didn't truly care about. In addition to all of these positive points, there are many more that support.  In conclusion, freedom to express interests, motivation to get things done, and bettering the all around process and scores are all reasons why summer projects should be student-designed. If you work at a school that assigns these summer projects or even if you just agree with this position, take a stand. You can open up a whole new way of teaching. This small change in summer learning can make a big change in education. With the world changing more and more everyday, it is time for education to take it's next step in bettering this generation.		0
Introduction:  The exploration of Venus has always been a topic of great interest and challenge for scientists and space agencies. In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author supports this idea by examining the evidence presented in the article.  Claim:  The author effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by highlighting the significant scientific benefits, discussing the challenges and obstacles, and providing examples of past successes.  Evidence:  One of the significant scientific benefits of studying Venus, as mentioned in the article, is the potential to gain a better understanding of Earth's climate. The author states, "Venus and Earth are similar in size and mass, and they are both rocky planets with atmospheres, making Venus a valuable proxy for understanding Earth's climate" (para. 4). This information highlights the importance of studying Venus in order to gain insights into Earth's climate, which is a crucial area of research in today's world.  Another point the author makes is that studying Venus can help us better understand the potential for life on other planets. The author states, "Venus is a prime target in the search for extraterrestrial life, as its thick atmosphere and extreme greenhouse effect make it a promising place to search for signs of life" (para. 6). This information suggests that studying Venus could lead to breakthroughs in the search for extraterrestrial life, which is a topic that has fascinated scientists and the general public alike for decades.  The author also discusses the challenges and obstacles of studying Venus, such as the extreme heat and pressure on the planet's surface. However, they also provide examples of past successes, such as the Soviet Union's Venera missions, which sent probes to Venus in the 1960s and 1970s. The author states, "Despite the challenges, the Venera missions were able to send back valuable data about Venus's atmosphere, surface, and geology" (para. 8). This information shows that it is possible to overcome the challenges of studying Venus and that past missions have been successful in gathering valuable data.  Conclusion:  In conclusion, the author effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by highlighting the significant scientific benefits, discussing the challenges and obstacles, and providing examples of past successes. The evidence presented in the article demonstrates the importance of studying Venus in order to gain a better understanding of Earth's climate and the potential for life on other planets. While the challenges of studying Venus are significant, the potential benefits make it a worthwhile pursuit. Therefore, I agree with the author's claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.		1
using technology like facial readingd to see what a student is feelingsin the classroom is a big step in history. i think its a fantastic idea. sometimes we humans casnt tell the difference friom a ginune or facke emotion. this computer system bybasses all of that and gets right down to business and tells us whats real and whats fake. using this new technology is a need for schools. i sometimes lie about not needing help or if im stuggling with a problem i normally skip over it or not ask for help. these facial readers reduce let the teachers know how i would be feelings and they could come to me and ask if i needed anything. the sarticle states that is the computer could tell how the student was feeling it could help the student learn by switching up problems and making it a better learning experience for the student. it could read the emotkons if studfents when they are having a tough time during a problem or when they are doing well with the emotions it reads.  the technology would benefit students because when they need help the technology either helps the teacher know whats wrong or helps the student with a better and more accurate learning experience.		0
Violent video games do make pepole more violent! Me and my friends were playing this one game, Call of Duty, and it was so realistic! We started acting like soldiers, yelling at each other and getting really competitive. I even punched my friend accidentally while we were playing! It made me realize that video games can really get to us and make us feel like we're in the game. That's not a good thing.  Also, have you seen the news? All these mass shooters were playing violent video games! It's like they got inspired by it or something. I don't think it's just a coincidence. Video games are like teaching us to be violent without us even realizing it.  I know some people say video games are just for fun and it's not a big deal, but I don't agree. Imagine if we're all playing these violent games and getting used to it, what kind of world are we gonna live in? It's gonna be chaos!  I'm not saying all video games are bad, but we need to be careful with the ones that are too violent. We need to set limits and make sure we're not playing them too much. We also need to pay attention to how it's affecting us and make sure we're not getting too caught up in it.  In conclusion, video games can definitely contribute to violent behavior and we need to be aware of it. We shouldn't just ignore it and say it's just a game. It's not just a game, it's our future we're talking about!		1
Ummm... hey there!  So, like, you know how teachers are always giving us praise and stuff? Like, when we do good on a test or turn in our homework on time?  Well, I think it's like, super important for our determination and self-confidence, you know?  I mean, when teachers give us praise, it's like they're acknowledging all the hard work we're putting in, and it makes us feel good about ourselves. It's like, they're saying, "Hey, you're doing a great job! Keep it up!" And that makes us want to keep working hard and doing better, you know?   Like, I remember when I got an A on my math test last quarter. My teacher gave me a big ol' smile and said, "Great job, [Your Name]! You're really putting in the effort." And I was like, "Whoa, thanks Mrs. Johnson!  I'm gonna keep studying and get even better!" And now I'm like, totally motivated to do well in math.   And it's not just about the grade, either. When teachers give us praise, it's like they're saying, "You're capable of doing great things!" And that makes us feel like, "Hey, maybe I can actually do this!"  Like, I used to be really bad at science, but my teacher would always give me positive feedback and encourage me to keep trying. And now I'm actually starting to get it!   So, yeah. Praise from teachers is like, super important for our determination and self-confidence. It makes us feel good about ourselves and motivates us to do better. And who doesn't want that?  Right?   Anyway, that's my essay.  I hope you like it!  Thanks for reading!		1
To start off, I think the technology to read emotional espressions of students is vulnerable because in todays society not a lot of people are great at socializing, their faces and actions speak louder than theirown words. Basically saying that students and teachers should know somethng is wrong with the person just by looking at their face and the expressions they're portraying.  In the article it states that the peoples faces don't lie and that this is a pro because it helps detect wheather a person is lying or not. On paragrapgh #8 it sites "To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful." Clearly, right there it states that we could know wheather a big person we look up towards to like our president could be lying to us or not just by simply using this advance computer technology to recognize human facial expressions. This is also a gret opportunity for humans and computers to develop better ways to communiacte. It's a great big step forward in society too. If you're not great at expressing how you feel verbally maybe you're better just facialy expressing it without saying a single word. This amamzing technology can even identify mixed emotions. In the article it staes that "The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication" says Dr. Huang. This means your computer could know how you feel without saying a single wrord. I also think this an advanatge to school consuelors because students sometime have trouble in school and don't really like to talk about their feelings.  To conclude, I think the technology to read emotionals expressions should be vulnerable to students and the teachers as well. Why? Becasuse a lot of people can struggle with anxiety/social problems and they just need somepone to talk to but just don't know how. This is why computer science is helpful to when it comes to situations like this. 		0
Landform or alien? The face on Mars looks pretty cool right. This face of Mars made it to hollywood and radio talks and books. People were egar to see this face, once they saw it then there was alien talk. We all know its cool to think there might be life out there, but it's just a natural landform.  Even though this face is so detailed with the mouth and the eyes and nose, it's just a natural landform. NASA even said it for themselves. " Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was NO alien monument after all." So, If a professional NASA team says it's a landform, i'm not going to argue on the debate.  However if your still not conviced I have more to prove. I haven't heard any information about aliens being true or alive. So, why would we still believe and hold on to the fact that there may not be life out there. NASA hasn't said anything about aliens but they have said that things happen. Such as the face on mars.  Although there are many, many facts about the face on Mars, I would get if you came up to me and said "Aliens did this to Mras because its so detail and how could that be if no one has been to Mars, so there are aliens." Only because we don't actually know if there are aliens ,but in the end its just lava that created this dome like face. "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa" Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.  In conclusion there are no aliens and its just a landform. NASA said it's just a landform and there isn't really information about aliens so im going to say that it just happened to be a lucky landform that just happened to show up as a face. 		0
Many students in the world are placed with the issue of whether or not it would be beneficial to actually attend school in a brick and mortar setting. Some find it beneficial, allowing the students to have a taste of freedom an independence in their work environment, while others think of it as an excuse to stay home and slack off. Pushing that agenda forward, many schools offer students the opportunity to take some of their classes off campus at a different location such as a community college campus or even in the comforts of their own homes. With that being said, more students are choosing to take their classes at different locations instead of the traditional setting. Students can benefit from taking classes away from the traditional settings of a school by letting them get a taste of their own educational freedom, and by lowering their stress levels while letting them become more comfortable in their own work environment.  Students can benefit from taking classes away from the traditional setting by giving them a taste of what their own educational freedom is like. Many college students around the world use online schooling in comparison to physical schooling on a campus. In the United States alone, many college students choose to use online schooling for a number of reasons. Online schooling may be used by them to help balance their lives, choosing to be able to do their work at their own time, compared to being in a building or university, where the deadlines are strict and there is possibly a hard time balancing their lives and school if they have a family. Having that type of educational freedom is very important in that sense, as to help students, no matter how old they are, achieve their educational goals in less of a strict environment.  Students can benefit from taking classes away from the traditional setting by helping lower their stress levels and being more comfortable in their own work environment. Many students face the intense pressures of being in a brick and mortar school environment and often can't handle it, becoming very uncomfortable where they are and losing sight of themselves in the stress. By pulling those students out of the environment that hinders their ability to learn and retain information properly due to their stress and lack of comfort, and placing them into an environment where they can prosper, retain and possibly learn faster can truly help students become better and more confident in themselves and the work they put out to the world. When students are constantly stressed out in their school setting, it makes it harder for them to excel in their studies, even when it isn't a subject that is particularly hard for them, so allowing them the extra educational freedom of choosing how they want to take their classes, whether it be completely at home on the computer, completely physical in a brick and mortar buliding, or some mixture of the two, students can combat their educational stress.  Not all students face the problem of being stressed in the school setting, some quite like how the curriculum can be set and like the challenges of strict due dates and lectures. More often than not, though, students do find it hard to juggle their schoolwork and their lives. Giving them the option to be able to replace the way they learn and their schooling in general can pave the way for them to become comfortable in their work setting, more dedicated to their work, and overall much happier students than they were before. By grabbing their attention with the benefits of schooling in ways that are seen as less stressful and easier, they can put more effort into their studies and get higher grades, all while getting a taste of all the different ways of schooling in college are like in the world.                                                                                                                                                                                      		0
CarFree Cities Humans almost feel the need to own a car almost as much as they feel the need to own a phone. The automobile industry has been a growing industry since World War 2. There are so many advantages to limiting car usage. Saving on gas and getting good exercise are just a few of the great advantages of limiting car usage.  Vauban, Germany understands that according to Source 1 which talks about how they have given up their cars! Not only is it saving them a ton of money on gas, car insurance, car payments, and fixing parts, it also gives them all great exercise. If everyone walks everywhere everyday the whole city will be fit in no time. Another advantage to the loss of cars, no car accidents. 180,000 people die a year due to car accidents. The death's in this city will be reduced drastically due to no cars. This no car movement is a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere as a component of a movement called "smart planning".  Source 2 talks about how Paris has banned driving due to smog. Congestion went down 60 percent in the capital of France. Delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. The advantages of limiting car usage here is the you'd never have to worry about there being smog outside or snow etc. Limiting car usage, you wouldn't have to worry about the weather being so terrible that you can't drive in smog or heavy rain and have a car accident.  Bogota, Colombia joins the no car movement for what is known as "CarFree Day". Source 3 discusses the day without cars in Bogota, Colombia. It is an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It's seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to their city's mayor. Limiting car usage in this city could be great for a lot of reasons. One being they are the only LatinAmerican city to have covered 118 miles of bicycle paths. Their parks and sports centers are now blooming throughout the city. It's uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.  Source 4 talks about the End of Car Culture. Studies have shown that as the years go on, driving is becoming less and less popular which is sad for many automobile industries worldwide. In America, the partial cause of the decrease in car usage is the unemployment rate being so low, it's not like someone has to go to work. Gas is becoming to expensive, why would people even want to have cars if they can barely afford them? Riding a bicycle is beneficial for more money in your pocket and more healthiness for your body.		0
 The electoral college is one of the most discussed political institutions in the United States. It was established by the framers of the U.S. Constitution to determine the president of the country, but does it work effectively as intended? There are arguments for and against the electoral college, but ultimately, it is important to consider its history, benefits, and limitations before determining whether it works effectively.  The electoral college system was established to represent the voices of the people in the election of the president. Under this system, the number of electors for each state is based on the state's population, with two senators representing each state and one representative for each Congressional district within the state. The electors are not elected by the people, but rather are chosen by the state legislature or by the state's governor. The president is elected by the majority of the electoral votes, and if no candidate receives a majority, the House of Representatives votes for the president.  One of the main benefits of the electoral college is that it allows the minority voice in a state to be heard. If a candidate does not receive a majority of votes in the popular vote of a state, but still wins the electoral vote, their position is still represented in the political process. Furthermore, the system helps to prevent extreme swings in national politics by giving each state a significant role in the election. This helps to prevent candidates from focusing solely on urban areas and neglecting rural areas, which can lead to a lack of representation for diverse groups of people.  However, there are also some limitations to the electoral college system. One of the main criticisms is that it does not accurately reflect the will of the people. The candidate who receives the most popular votes nationwide does not necessarily become the president. In 2000, for example, George W. Bush became the president despite losing the popular vote to Al Gore, but winning the electoral vote. This has led to suggestions that the electoral college is outdated and should be abolished.  Another criticism of the electoral college is that it allows the candidate with more money and resources to win the election. In recent years, there has been a trend towards spending vast amounts of money on campaigns and the election has become even more expensive. This has led to concerns that candidates with more resources will be able to dominate the campaign process and win the election, regardless of their actual qualifications.  In conclusion, the electoral college works as intended to represent the voices of the people in the election of the president, and it has many benefits. However, there are also limitations to the system, such as its failure to accurately reflect the will of the people and its potential for candidates with more money and resources to win the election. It is important to carefully consider the benefits and limitations of the electoral college before determining whether it works effectively as intended. Ultimately, the role of the electoral college in determining the president of the United States is a complex and critical issue that requires careful consideration and ongoing debate.		1
 Introduction:  Driverless cars have become increasingly popular in the modern world, with many experts predicting that they will become a mainstream form of transportation in the future. While some people see the benefits of driverless cars, others are skeptical about their potential. In this essay, I will argue in favor of driverless cars.  Body:  The article   Driverless Cars are Coming   presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. While some people worry about the safety of these cars, the author argues that they can actually be safer than traditional cars. The article notes that driverless cars use a variety of sensors and artificial intelligence to navigate roads, and they are able to detect hazards that human drivers might miss. This means that they can potentially prevent accidents before they occur.  In addition to safety concerns, some people worry that driverless cars could lead to job loss. However, the article argues that driverless cars have the potential to create new job opportunities. For example, as the vehicles become more prevalent, there will be a need for people to maintain and repair them. Additionally, the article notes that driverless cars could actually reduce traffic congestion, as they would be able to navigate traffic more efficiently than human drivers.  One of the most compelling arguments for driverless cars is their potential to reduce the stress of driving. Many people find driving to be a stressful and tedious experience, especially during rush hour or on busy roads. Driverless cars would eliminate this stress, as they would allow passengers to relax and focus on other tasks while the car navigates on its own.  Conclusion:  In conclusion, driverless cars have many potential benefits. While some people worry about their safety and job loss, the article   Driverless Cars are Coming   argues that these concerns can be addressed. Driverless cars have the potential to reduce traffic congestion and create new job opportunities, while also allowing passengers to relax and focus on other tasks. Ultimately, I believe that the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the potential drawbacks, and I hope that they become widely adopted in our society.		1
In my opinion people ask for others opinion because they dont know if they should do something so they ask people and get there opinion. therefor if you need some ones opinion you can just ask people to give you there opinion and you can see if you like what they are telling you. also if you need some good advice you can ask your mom and dad because they will not lie to you but if you go walking on the street the people on the street might lie to you for,example if you walk in the streets of Generic_City people are probably not going to help you but, if you say hey mom I need some advice on blah blah blah she is probably going to say OK and then se is going to tell you what she thanks.  At the beginning of my passage I sad no one would give you good advice but, I forgot to say there is some good people in the would. If you wanted to beter choice and you had bad freinds the might just want to see you fight of you and a nother person. afterthat you get in trouble and then the call your mon and trust me you dont want that.		0
As an eighth-grade student, I believe that family and society have a significant impact on an individual's ability to make their own life decisions. While it is important for individuals to have autonomy and the ability to make choices for themselves, the influence of family and society can make it difficult for individuals to fully exercise their independence.  Family plays a crucial role in shaping an individual's values, beliefs, and attitudes towards various aspects of life. Parents and other family members often provide guidance and support to their children, helping them navigate the challenges of growing up. However, this guidance can sometimes come at the expense of the individual's autonomy. For example, parents may pressure their children to pursue certain career paths or attend specific schools, even if the child's interests or goals differ. This can limit the individual's ability to make decisions that align with their own values and aspirations.  Society also plays a significant role in shaping an individual's ability to make their own life decisions. Cultural norms, beliefs, and values can influence an individual's attitudes towards various aspects of life, such as relationships, career choices, and personal goals. Additionally, societal expectations and pressures can make it difficult for individuals to make decisions that go against the norm. For example, individuals who choose to pursue unconventional career paths or lifestyles may face criticism or discrimination from society.  However, it is important for individuals to have the ability to make their own life decisions. Autonomy allows individuals to pursue their own interests and goals, and to make choices that align with their own values and beliefs. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and a sense of agency in life.  In conclusion, while family and society play a significant role in shaping an individual's ability to make their own life decisions, it is important for individuals to have the ability to exercise their autonomy. By valuing and respecting an individual's independence, we can help them make decisions that align with their own values and aspirations.		1
dear principle, helping your c community is very important. we need play our role by helping the elderly because maybe they need assistance. help or tutor kids in their homework at the community center because sometimes they have trouble solving some problems. you can also organize a community clean up so it could be a polluted free area.  living a clean , garbage free area is very important. some people just liter because they are to lazy to throw their trash in their trash cans. some people even let their babies walk outside their side walk, filled with bacteria and trash. little kids are tempted to eat the trash and sometimes end up indigested the trash. if we do a team were we pick up the trash once a month , mother nature could be proud of us. also by cleaning our community we make people happy, and we can live in a healthy and friendly community.  kids need help with their home work every time. sometime parents do not have time to help their kids because they are busy .if we do a homework help club, we could help these children be smarter so they could succeed and achieve in life. also we can save their parents time in their work and have time to play with their son or daughter.  the elderly sometimes need assistance or are lonely because nobody come and visit them.  sometimes old people feel lonely because either they were abandoned by their families or their are just one person. if we visit them once in a while, we could play a game with them or read a story with them, they cold be happy and enjoy they have company.  once we do does task then everybody would be happy. we should help each other hand in hand . with our good deeds and actions we could live in a blessed community. we need to enjoy life and helping others.      		0
Have you ever been torn between multiple things to say or do? I have, but I went to my family for the help I needed. Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present.  Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present. In order to make the best decision, you must go to the people you trust the most: your family. Family is always there for you, even when life seems at it's lowest. Asking the younger members in your family for advice might not be the brightest choice to make, but going to your elders is the best possible choice to make while seeking advice. Looking up to your elder family members is the best thing you can do when seeking opinions because, they have the most knowledge about how to act socially, and you know that you can fully trust them with what you're telling them. An instance where your elders come in, is what to say and when. Almost all teenagers have been made fun of or been in some form of drama and, they don't know what to say back to the bullies. That's where your elders come in. Your elders already know what it's like to feel that way, so they understand greatly. They give you multiple opinions and options to choose from when confronting the bullies. Many teenagers, including me have successfully stood up to bullies after talking with elder family members.  Let's face it, we've all had to face some terrifying situations and, we didn't know what to do. But we all have our families to guide us to make the right choices. Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present. Next time that you're being faced with a challenge, go to your family. They will support you no matter what.		0
I think the idea of being able to see other kids emotions or feelings from a computer is a bad idea. No one should know what the kid is going through unless that kid wants you to know he or she will tell you.  If the kid wants it to be private or can't tell anyone anything then they don't want others to know at all. If they are mad they shouldn't take it out on someone else. They could maybe ask a close friend or teacher or parent for help or ask them what they should do. He or she could be going through a lot at home or with grades or a bully that makes he or she mad. Parents need to ask there kids and wonder are they doing ok in school is everything alright if there kid is showing emotions for being mad or sad then they should be concerned. Most kids will be to scared to tell others cause they think they will get into trouble so they just stay quiet. Some kids take the pain out on there selfs and harm there selfs or worse. The kid shouldn't be asking what to do cause they are to scared. The guardian, teacher, friend or someone close should be asking them are you ok or im here for you then the kid will speak up and talk.  My opion on whether the computer should read kids expressions is no that's the parents job or guardian computers don't run are life's and the guardian should know if there kid is doing ok or not and help them instead of a computer helping them on there life situations.		0
In the year 2018 technology is advancing as well as schools all around the world. Most kids roll their eyes or yawn or even have a bored/tired look on their face when they're in a classroom that hey dont enjoy. With new technology called FACS(Facial Action Coding System), it will be able to detect when kids are feeling this way.  The computer makes a 3-D model face of a human and have all 44 major musles that operates like human musles, then it scans the face of a real human which will then identify what the person is feeling right now such as happy, sad, tired, scared and many more. Using this type of technology will be very helpful in classrooms because when a student is feeling bored or tired then the computer will be able to detect that the the teacher will be able to make the topic more interesting for the students. Most teachers have about 28 students per class for seven periods everyday which can be very stressful, so it can be very challenging for them to recognize when students are dealing with a certain type of emotion but with the FACS it can recognize that and the teacher will be able to help the student or students.  In conclusion, FACS is an amazing creation that will be able to help students and teachers. Kids learn the most when they're happy and when the subject they're learning is fun and very interesting and when they're in a good environment. With FACS, it not only detects a humans emotion but it will be able to communicate with a teacher to notify them when a kid is not doing well.           		0
Showing kindness is an integral part of being a good person, and one that brings many benefits to both the giver and the receiver. When we give of our time, resources, or simply a kind word, we lift the spirits of those around us and bring joy to their day. Kindness can be shown in many forms; small kindnesses, like holding the door open for someone, smiling at a passerby on the sidewalk, and helping a neighbor with a task, can make an immense difference.  Kindness is self-serving too—it can brighten our own mood, create feelings of satisfaction and even boost our mood. We can feel a sense of purpose, and of being part of something larger than ourselves, when we give of ourselves voluntarily. Moreover, kind acts often lead to genuine relationships, further prospering the atmosphere around us. Being kind helps promote our mental and emotional well-being as it enables us to be more resilient and helps combat stress.  In a world where negative news stories are pervasive, making an effort to show kindness can help change the course of our day for ourselves and those around us. It is a simple yet powerful act that can have profound impacts. Giving of ourselves, in whatever capacity, pays off in the end; simply taking a moment to be kind to someone means we can be part of something greater. Therefore, the importance of showing kindness should not be underestimated.		1
Dear Principle  I think that students should be allowed to have cell phones during free periods and lunch times. I think this because students use cell phones during those times anyway. Students can use cell phones during school without getting caught during school and don't really care if they get caught. Allowing cell phones during free time can let them check things like e-mail or facebook and let them talk to there friends.  Anther reason to allow cell phones in school is that they can lead to better grades. This is because if students can use them during free time they won't have to use them during class witch can cause them to pay more attention to the subject. If students pay more attention during class it can lead to better grades.  These are the reasons i think cell phones should be allowed in school. i hope this affects your decision to change the cell phone policy in school.		0
Dear Principal,  I strongly disagree with your idea on changing the grade average from a C average to a B average. The students who participate in sports have to work twice as hard as any other student who doesn't participate in sport activities, because they have homework, practice and games. The games take up at least two hours and if they don't finish their homework after school before the game they have to finish it after their game which could go from six o clock to eight. They also have to be there an hour early. When they get home it's late and they just want to relax because they have worked hard that day. But they have to finish their homework and if they have a project they have to work on that to. It's harder for them even more when they have a test they next day and they have a sports event the night they are going to study even more, so they have to stay up later then usual. Then they don't get a good night of sleep then they don't do good on the test because they are tired. Which means they cant participate in the sport they play because of that. I would know this because I participate in sport activities and I have to work very hard to get good grades I have to stay up late and sometimes I don't get good night rests. The next day I am really tired and I don't do as good in school as I should because of it.  It's a lot harder in school because of sports if you change the average then school will be even harder and if the athletes don't get a B average then all of there hard work in school would be for nothing. Then if the athletes got their grades up it would most likely go back down because they would be back in sports which would cause the whole process over again. They are working twice as hard and they have a C average but they would have to work even harder which would be very difficult for them.		0
Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure they continue learning during their break. Students should get to choose the project they want because they will learn more and will enjoy doing a topic of their liking. Having a teacher choose could likely end up in failure to complete, due to the topic and student preference. Allowing them the freedom of choice will result in a higher pass rate and assurance of learning on break.  The first reason schools should let students choose is because the student will enjoy doing the project. A student will choose something that keeps them interested and entertained which will assure they complete and get a good grade on the project. Most teen students have a short attention span which could cause them to get bored and stop trying if they get a topic that isnt enjoyable for them. As a result in students doing the topic they enjoy, they focus more and can get it done easier  The second reason schools should let students choose is because they will learn more as they progress on the project. When students choose their own topic of their liking it proves they'll learn more the more research is done about that topic. A student may not know where to find specific information required if a teacher chose the topic since they wont know much or anything about it. research has shown that even lazy students learned more while on break because they got to choose a topic they enjoyed.  If students chose the topic then a student could already know everything about it which may result in them not learning more while on break. Students could have also done a previous project on the same topic they chose this time and they could remake it and result in learning nothing.  In conclusion, schools that require summer projects should allow students to design and choose the topic. Having this will result in the whole class completing the project and get a passing grade on it. Students will complete it easily and will know where to find the information without any issue. This will assure they have learned more and retained any information in their heads		0
Cars have always been used to get from point A to point B. That is how the people in society know what cars are for. However, there are other alternatives when is comes to going form one destination to another. Citizens should limit their car usage. It helps with the terrible traffic on the street. Also, there will be no more pollution in the air. In addition, citizens can be able to enjoy the world.  Everyone has been caught in traffic, whether it is going to work or school or meeting up with someone. Everyone has been in traffic before. People can prevent traffic form happening. There is carpooling, it can help limit traffic on the streets. Just like it states in source three, "...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." There are other ways to avoid and stop traffic. Not everyone needs to take their own personal car to work. They can either car pool or take public transportation to save money because gas isn't cheap these days. In addition, traffic sometimes end up leading to accidents. There are several people who died in a car accident due to someone speeding because he or she doesn't want to wait in the traffic. However, if everyone just finds another alternative way to get to his or her destination, then no one has to die. Just like it explains in proclaims in source four, "pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety." This qoute listed some alternatives way to get somewhere. By doing these things it will not only limit the traffic but the resources and the safety of other people. Traffic isn't a fun place to be in, so find another way to get to his or her destination can prevent traffic.  Air pollution is everywhere we go. Whether someone travels to Japan, India, or South America. There willbe air pollution there. It might not have same amount of air pollution as other countries but there is still pollution. Why? Because there are people who uses his or her personal car not thinking about what happens to the air that they breathe. However, there is a solution to limit the pollution in the air. Limiting car usage or find another way to get to the certain destination. Mr. siva even claims that "A car is just a means of getting from A to B..." Cars is just a means of transportation. So are bicycles, trucks, buses, traind. However, all these have one thing in common, they are all going form destination A to destination B. Biking, walking, skating are some way to stop the gas from the vehicles from polluting the air. Actually, by using these methods pollution can be reduced. For example source three states, "...uneven, pitted sidewalks have bee replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic..." When people don't use his or her car and decides to find another way to get to their destination it helps reduce the traffic.  There are several people who say that they know what the real world is since he or she travels all the time in their car. However, do people really know the sounds of kids laughter when walking down the side walk or a bicycle bell violently ringing at someone to get out of their way? Not a lot of people know this because they are usually used to their vehicles getting them places. People will argue that they have heard all of those before and that they were happier. But Ms. Walter thinkgs other wise, "When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Ms. Walter has been walking on the streets and she hears the swish of bicycles and the talkative children and occastional a distant motor. These help people better appreciate the world that they live in because not everything will last forever. In addition to this, less cars means more people walking which means that several people will end up walking pass a shop and look what is inside. For instance in source three is explains, "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed through the city uneven...and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up." It helps by walking to find new stores or restaurants people never heard of.  Several people believe that the only way to get somewhere is by car. That isn't necessarily true. Skating, walking, biking, car pooling or public transportation can help get anyone from point A to B. Yes, it will take longer on foot than by car but it helps the environment, it stops from the air getting all the gasoline form the cars. It is faster than being stuck in traffic. Someone who is biking to school can be five minutes late while soneone who is took their car and got stuck in traffic can be an hour late. Limiting car usage is a way that everyone can explore the world than being stuck in that four or tw door car. Limiting car usage has its downs but it also have its perks.		0
Dear, State Senator  Some people in the America are worried about the voting for the president. Some people are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, and other are in favor of channging the voting system to popular vote. Going in favor of Electoral College has only one good favor like in Source 1 it says that "The Cerificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent oyur state at the meeting of the electors in Decemeber of the election year."  In the Electoral College there is somthing a bit unfair, if on of the presidential cadidate went after the bigger city's like Florida,Texas,or California (as showed in the picture in Source 3) the would have a big lead in the race for one of the cadidates. If one of the presidential cadidates got all three of them then it would be like a win-win for them. After they got those three it would be that hard to go after which ever state he want to get to vote for him.  Even though Electoral College is a good way popular vote would give a clear vote on who would win the presidential election. If we went with popular vote it would just matter on the people's vote on who they woluld want in the White House. If there is a tie, then the should find one person off the streets and ask them who would they want to win the presidential election. All they would have to do is give him a piece of paper with both names and he would pick one. If the state went to popular votes then Obama and Romney would most likely had a closer race then what it was. In Source 2 it says "According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct electin to the kind we have know."  But know that you know some people in America don't like the Electoral College and saw what they had to say mabye just mabye you will consider changing how we the people ofAmerica vote to choose who we want in the White House.    		0
If you like to join programs and to help out with people who need help then you should consider joining Seagoing cowboy. why you should join is because seagoing cowboys have helped many countries that have been left to ruin and if you join you could have the chance to help the ruined countries who need help through disaster. Also meeting the needs of other people and seeing the needs of other countries.  UNRRA is a group of 44 nations joined together to form United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation. UNRRA has hired Seagoing cowboys to help with their program for example in 1945 World War 11 was over in Europe, and many were left to ruin. In that case UNRRA and seagoing cowboys helped by taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. So meaning that they helped even though it was a very long project. But it is worth a try to do something new if not tried before.  Putting the idea of joining there are some benificial things of joining. For example you get to visit different places and meeting new people could be fun. By joining it could bring good oportunities like it could open up the world to some people. And it makes you aware of people of other countries and their needs not just yours. it would help people feel better knowing that you just helped animals or other people.		0
The argument of "would this technology be valuable in a classroom setting" seems like it is very one sided.  Yes, this technology would be 100% valuable in a class room enviroment. And in the article it give a reason why it is so valuable! "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."  With these two reasons we can determine the value that they would have in schools. grades would get better, some may inspire to work harder because someone or something can tell they are confused and need help. Another quote that can support my claim is that "Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication," "so computers need to under stand that, too." What this means is that the one kid who is afraid to speak up and ask questions or the kids who cant speak at all will get better help, because the computers can identify what emotions they are feeling and help them.  A drawback to having the technology in the classroom could mean that we could give off the wrong emotions and confuse the computer it self. and this could mean ruining the techology or worse. Another drawback would be that in paragraph seven it states "Your home PC can't handle the comples algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile." this means that we would have to have advanced technology inside of a classroom, And if it is more younger kids its going to be super hard to keep it from being ruined or broken. Another set back would be People who suffer from Depression, Bipolar or PTSD can change emotions constantly and quickly.  This is why FACS (Facial Action Coding System) CAN be used in a classroom enviroment as well as being succsesful in said enviroment.		0
The Rise of Driverless Technology    The development of driverless cars brings both promise and peril. While autonomous vehicles could reduce accidents and increase accessibility, their widespread adoption poses technological and ethical risks worth considering. On balance, a cautious approach to this new technology seems most prudent.  Details from the article support both sides of this debate. Driverless cars could eliminate human error, the cause of over 90% of crashes according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. By scanning the road and reacting quicker than humans, autonomous vehicles may decrease accidents and save thousands of lives each year. They could also help the elderly and disabled gain independent transportation.   However, the article also raises legitimate concerns. Fully autonomous vehicles may not be achievable for decades, and transitioning too quickly could endanger lives. Machine learning is an imperfect process - without extensive real-world experience, algorithms cannot anticipate every situation like human drivers can. Ethical questions abound about how computers should respond in split-second situations involving loss of life. And widespread adoption could displace millions of jobs that rely on human vehicle operation.  Rather than rushing development, policymakers and companies would be wise to thoroughly test driverless technologies through pilot programs first. Humans must stay engaged as a failsafe to handle unexpected scenarios outside of algorithms' training. Any deployment should happen gradually, car by car, as knowledge improves. Overall safety and social consequences should take priority over profit or popularity considerations.   Driverless cars offer promise, but also problems not yet solved. A prudent path forward is comprehensive research, rigorous testing, and cautious adoption - not abandonment of human oversight before the technology proves truly ready to drive itself. With care and oversight rather than carelessness or haste, autonomous vehicles may someday transform transportation for the better. But getting there will require balancing innovation and caution at every step.		1
The Open Seas Await  For years I found myself dreaming of adventures beyond the ranch. Life as a cowboy was rewarding, but I longed to experience new destinations and cultures far from home. When I heard of the Seagoing Cowboys program, I knew this was my chance to satisfy my wanderlust.   This program offered experiences I never thought possible. As the article detailed, I got to travel to exotic locales like French Polynesia and Tahiti, seeing stunning coral reefs and learning about island traditions. Each new place brought fresh perspectives and memories to last a lifetime. I even tried my hand at crewing aboard tall sailing ships, braving winds and waves to reach distant shores. It was thrilling to face challenges on the open water after a lifetimeon land.  More than exotic destinations, the program opened my eyes to the relentlessness and majesty of the sea. I gained new appreciation for maritime history and the hardworking sailors who traverse oceans. The camaraderie among our crew was like nothing I've known before or since. We leaned on each other through stormy nights and calm mornings alike. I look back on those voyages with tremendous gratitude, knowing how they stretched my abilities and broadened my worldview.   For anyone seeking adventure beyond your daily routines, I cannot recommend Seagoing Cowboys enough. You will build confidence facing the unexpected, develop lifelong friends, and visit places you never imagined. While life on the ranch will always be in my blood, the seas now call me as well. I hope this program will allow others to answer that call, as it enriched my life in ways I could not have foreseen. The open seas await - don't miss your chance to answer their Sirens song.		1
As a result of the decrease usesage of cars over the past years. people have found it to be beneficial to use other means or tranportations such as bikes,walking, or even taking a public tranportations. Not only is it more excercise to walk or ride a bike rather then to take a car and getting to your destination faster,but it can cause less pollution on the earth then their is already. Other reasons to give up on your cars like it said it source 2 its less traffic out during busy days.  Source number 2 was saying that they made a deal or law is you call it to fine the drivers that drove during the day,they were to leave the car at home and take other means of tranportation to get to their destination. Many people didnt like it so thy complained and got their car inpunded for a day due to complaing. they were tying this beause they use diesel rather then gasoline it makes about 67% of france .It can be done in bigger states or cities like it showed in sourve 3 colombia had a population of over 7 million people but they tried it and yet many people liked it even when bad weather showed up they didnt seem to mid it and fot the others they were fine a total of $25 if the droved anywhere that day. so over all limiting the car usage is helpull by casusing less trafiic in busy streets or places .  Other  then the  usage of less car the companies had complain that many people are buying less cars now that some people rather walk or bike then to buy a car and waste money on gasoline,and repairing the damages that might come to the car. It not only safes money for people but its more then ever safer for children to be out playing and less people behind the wheel of a car and making parents much more comfortable and less worried. like it said in source 3 that many people started to actually like the new way things were working now that less people use cars and its safer and causes less polluiton to the world by doing so.  As a result limiting the usage of cars can have a huge impact on someone regular life that use to driving everywere,and to all of a sudden stop using cars. Their is more impotant reasons to limit car using such as its safer for people,less car accidents ,safes money ,less pollution on the world, and last but not least  it safes time.            		0
While distance learning provides flexibility and convenience, I do not believe it is as beneficial for students as attending classes in person. There are several reasons why in-person instruction is preferable to distance learning from home.  Firstly, attending school in person allows for valuable interaction and collaboration between students. In a traditional classroom setting, students can easily turn to their peers to discuss assignments, ask questions, and work together on group projects. Distance learning makes spontaneous interaction much more difficult and limits opportunities for students to learn from each other.  Secondly, it can be challenging for students to stay focused and motivated when learning from home without the structure and accountability of a classroom. With distractions like phones, televisions and household responsibilities, students may be more likely to fall behind or neglect their school work if learning remotely. The classroom environment provides discipline and helps students develop time management skills.   Finally, in-person classes are important for students' social and emotional development. Beyond just academics, attending school provides opportunities to socialize, participate in extracurricular activities, and interact daily with teachers and mentors. The school community plays a key role in many students' well-being. Distance learning is more isolating and does not replicate the social benefits of the traditional school experience.  In conclusion, while distance learning options provide increased flexibility, students would not truly benefit as much as from attending classes in person. The interactive, collaborative nature of the classroom environment, as well as the structure and social aspects of school, make in-person instruction preferable for student development and success. Some flexibility with remote learning could be valuable, but it should not fully replace the traditional school experience.		1
Success: The Key to Unlocking Our Potential  Success. The word itself conjures up images of achievement, accomplishment, and happiness. But what does it really mean to be successful? Is it the grade we get on a test, the job we land after graduation, or the amount of money we make? Or is it something more? As an 8th grader, I've come to realize that success is so much more than just a number or a title. It's the culmination of hard work, dedication, and passion.  At school, success is often defined by our grades and test scores. We're told that getting good grades will lead to a successful future, whether that's college or a career. But what if we don't get those good grades? Does that mean we're not successful? Absolutely not. Failure is a natural part of life, and it can often be the best teacher. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is famously quoted as saying, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." Failure can help us learn and grow, and it can often lead to even greater success.  Professionally, success is about finding a job that we love and are good at. It's about making a difference in the world and being recognized for our contributions. But it's not just about the money. Success is also about finding purpose and meaning in our work. When we're passionate about what we do, we're more likely to be successful in the long run.  Personally, success is about being happy and fulfilled. It's about finding joy in the little things and making the most of every day. It's about pursuing our passions and living a life that we can be proud of. But it's not always easy. There will be setbacks and failures, and it's important to learn from them and keep moving forward.  So how can we achieve success? The key is dedication, effort, and enthusiasm. When we're passionate about something, we're more likely to put in the hard work and make sacrifices to achieve our goals. We have to be willing to take risks and		1
Imagine seeking advice from multiple people and choosing the best decision that suits you. How does that make you feel? Asking for advice can be defined as someone who asks help from multiple people and makes the right decision. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision because they can see which advice is better, more experienced, and see the persons point of view.  Asking advice from multiple people can help you see which advice is better. Let's say this person needs to ask their teacher what book to choose. But, they also asked their friends the same question. They can now see which decision is better for them. It also depends if the advice is decent or not because if the advice is horrible, then that decision you make can affect the outcome.  Another way asking advice from multiple people can help you is they might have more experience. For instance, they need help picking a collage that suits their interest. When they ask their parents for advice, the parent might pick a different collage that could be better. But, that's because they have more experience and can see whats best for them. Grandparents especially, went through a lot when they were kids. So, if you need advice, ask adults who are more experienced in life!  Lastly, asking advice from multiple people can help you see the persons point of view. For example, they can see what other people have to say and can help you make that better decision. Let's say they need help painting their house but dont know what paint color to choose. But, when they ask someone for advice, they can see what the other person has to say and make the right decision based on that advice.  In conclusion, asking advice can help someone make a better decision because they can see the persons point of view, more experienced, and they can see which advice is better. Asking for advice is important because they can see which advice is better and can see other peoples perspective. This affects you because its on you to ask for advice and make the right decision!		0
Venus, Venus is known as Earths twin because of having similarity's. NASA hasn't yet found a way to have a rocketship to last on the palnet, so let alone a person could last up there. The longest a rocket has lasted on the planet was three weeks. NASA is still working on a way to send a rocket and people onto Venus wothout failing.  Venus is supposed to be the Earth's twin. Venus has the closest density, size and occasionally the cloest planet in distance too. This planet is the second planext from the Earth. All the planets orbit the sun at different speeds, and sometimes Eath is closer to Mars and other times it is closer to Venus. Venus is called the "Evening star"  At the begining no space craft had survived on Venus for hours, but one of the space crafts have lasted for three weeks. They may call Venus Earth's twin but it isnt a livable place. The pressuure of the planet is 90 times grater than Earth's. Venus has a very thick atmospere of 97% carbon dixide. The conditions are far to extreme to humans. The enviorment would be able to crush even a submarine that can take a lot of water pressure at the deepest point, Venus would liquefy the metal.  Venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in the solar system. Even thought Mercury is the closest planet to the sun Venus is still hottest within heat and pressure. The temeture is 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The air pressure is also almost sea level on Earth. The enviorment is very rocky, it has many valleys, mountains ans crates. It has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and freguent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. They say Venus used to be covered in Oceans.  NASA is doing hundreds of projects to get a space craft to land on Venus and to explore Venus. NASA is experimenting with mechanical computers which were first envisioned in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during World War II. Its very shocking that modern computers can't last up on Venus. Modent computers do not have the gears and leavels that the mechanical computer has. That computer is much more controlable and is not more lyable to have problems.  All together Venus is not a livable planet, yet and probally will not be one for a while. A human can live on Venus but it will be very hard to live on. As i said before it has 97% of Carbon dioxide and is more likely gonna be very hard to breath. Venus is very very hot at 170 degrees fahrenheit. The air pressure is really close to sea leavels on Earth imagine how hard it is to breath there. The planet is very rocky and has many valleys, moutains and caters. Let's not forget that you may wake up to erupting volcanos, powerful eathquakes, and freguent lightning stikes to probes seeking to land its surface. That all happens on the planet Venus. Would you want to live there?		0
Being yourself is an important aspect of life that is often overlooked. It is easy to get caught up in the desire to fit in and be accepted by others, but this can lead to a loss of individuality and authenticity. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of being yourself and provide an example from personal experience.  One of the reasons why it is important to be yourself is that it allows you to express your true thoughts and feelings. When you try to act like someone you are not, you are hiding your true self and suppressing your individuality. This can lead to feelings of frustration and unhappiness, as you are not able to fully express yourself.  For example, when I was in middle school, I struggled with fitting in and making friends. I often felt like I had to act a certain way in order to be accepted by my peers. However, I soon realized that this was not sustainable and that I was not able to be myself. I began to embrace my true self and started to make friends based on my interests and passions, rather than trying to fit in with the popular crowd. This allowed me to express myself fully and feel more authentic in my interactions with others.  Another reason why it is important to be yourself is that it allows you to build meaningful relationships. When you are trying to act like someone you are not, you are not able to form genuine connections with others. This is because you are not able to fully express yourself and build trust with others.  For example, when I was in high school, I had a friend who always tried to act like someone else in order to fit in. However, this made it difficult for us to have meaningful conversations and build a strong friendship. We were not able to fully express ourselves and understand each other, which led to a lack of depth in our relationship. Eventually, we drifted apart because we were not able to build a strong foundation based on authenticity.  In conclusion, being yourself is an important aspect of life that allows you to express your true thoughts and feelings, build meaningful relationships, and feel more authentic in your interactions with others. It is easy to get caught up in the desire to fit in and be accepted by others, but this can lead to a loss of individuality and authenticity. By embracing your true self, you can build strong, meaningful relationships and feel more authentic in your interactions with others.		1
When creating movies, games, or any other art, its a good idea to get advice from others instead of just one person, first off, its a good strategy to make your work more diverse, makes it more appealing, and more opinions is better than one.  First off, when creating art, its important to get advice from others, but the more you get, the more clearer and more diverse it becomes. They can tell you if you messed up and why. They can give you ideas to make characters to fill in the gaps, They can also help expand the story.  Second off, If you want to seem as appealing as possible, you should ask people for what they want and work with them. If you want your work to succeed you must work with others so you both get what you want. appealing to peoples opinions also helps your work by showing that you care. everyone has different opinions, one person might like one thing while everyone else hates it. appeal to the bigger opinion.  Lastly, the more opinions you have, the more messages your art will have. One person isnt enough to give enough opinions. instead of just one opinion, you should have multible opinions so you can give your art a message. listening and getting feedback from multible sources will help you and your art in conclusion, three good reasons why to get multible opinions is; making it more appealing to a general audience, fill in gaps, and get feedback.		0
As citizens, it is important for us to be aware of the advantages of limiting car usage. The passage set highlights several benefits of reducing our reliance on cars, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, and increased physical activity.  One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars emit harmful pollutants that contribute to air pollution, which can have negative impacts on our health. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease the amount of pollution in the air we breathe. This can lead to a healthier population and a cleaner environment.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. Traffic jams can be frustrating and time-consuming, but they also have a negative impact on the environment. When cars are stuck in traffic, they are emitting more pollution than they would be if they were moving. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.  Finally, limiting car usage can also lead to increased physical activity. When we rely on cars for transportation, we are less likely to walk or bike to our destinations. However, when we limit our car usage, we are forced to find alternative modes of transportation. This can lead to increased physical activity, which has numerous health benefits.  In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages that can benefit both individuals and society as a whole. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and increase physical activity. It is important for us to be aware of these benefits and work towards reducing our dependence on cars.		1
Phones and Driving  Phones play a big role in the generation we now live in. We may not realize how phones or electronics in general are affecting society and what we do on a daily basis. These phones are affecting human life slowly from all ages including babies. One of the main impact that cell phones have had on society is the use of them while driving a vehicle and this shouldn't be allowed.  In many cases using a cell phone while driving has had a big impact on society and should be banned in all States. People should not be allowed to use their phones while driving For instance people texting or talking on the phone (physically holding phone)while driving is a big distraction. These people are the causes of accidents and usually innocent people die because of dull decisions people take.  As a result the CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has stated that in 2016, 3,450 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver and the numbers have increased over the years. Also according to them when people take their eyes off for five seconds while going fifty-five mile per hour, it is long enough to cover a football field ("Distracted Driving") . There are billions of reasons why people go against it and why we should have them banned while driving and this is for our safety.  Everyone on the road is at risk. We can all help out by taking action to prevent innocent people's life. For example by simply just putting away the cell phone, you can prevent so many things and reduce the chances of crashing and you'll be more focused on the road. We can also text or call anyone before starting the car and then put on Do Not Disturb that iphones provide, which does not allow calls or texts from anyone. There are so many options to prevent you touching your phone while driving. We just all have to take action and make the road a safer place .

Dear Senator,   I am writing to express my support for changing how we elect the President of the United States from the current Electoral College system to a national popular vote. While the Electoral College was established by the founders with the aim of giving smaller states more influence, I believe it no longer serves that purpose and has some significant downsides.  One argument made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaigns in more states. However, research shows that in recent elections candidates have focused their efforts only on swing states that could vote either way. This means that voters in the vast majority of non-swing states see little campaigning. Using a popular vote would encourage candidates to campaign across the entire country and address issues important to more Americans.   It is also argued that without the Electoral College, candidates might only focus on densely populated areas. However, we live in a different era than the founders, with modern communication technology allowing candidates to easily reach voters anywhere. A popular vote would reflect the preference of all Americans regardless of where they live. Some also claim the Electoral College protects small states, but in reality it can result in a president being elected despite losing the national popular vote. This has occurred a few times in history and erodes many Americans' confidence in the democratic process.   In conclusion, while the Electoral College may have served purposes in the past, today it discourages voter turnout, fails to ensure that the candidate preferred by the most Americans wins the presidency, and does not operate as intended by the founders. I believe moving to a national popular vote would make our democracy more representative of the will of the people and encourage greater civic participation across the country. I hope you will consider supporting legislation to implement this change.  Thank you for your consideration.  Sincerely, [Your name]		1
PHONES AND DRIVING  Although cell phones have been in this world for a while they have made their way into our daily lives, we use them for just about everything like texting, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can multitask while being on it. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong times to multi task: while they're driving. As a nation, we have become so focused on how much we can do do at one time that we are literally putting our life on the line, all because we can't put down our cell phones. Using any handheld device while driving is dangerous to the drivers for a couple of good reasons.  When driving sometimes it's difficult to focus on the road and where your trying to go, which makes it easy to forget the road is shared by people doing the same thing. It's not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice to drivers on their phone whether its intentional or because of the hazard caused by it. When driving there is a great deal of skill and expertise that should go int maneuvering a 2-ton vehicle around and with other 2-ton vehicles so why end to life with a 1-pound phone?  Recently there has been a law passed saying you can't have your phone in your hand while driving and if you do and get caught you have to pay a pretty big fine. Its literally seen as illegal and there are still major accidents because of it. Using your phone while driving, no matter how good you are at driving is dangerous to the person driving, the possible passengers and the rest of the community having to deal with the reckless endangerment of citizens who don't put law and safety over their own entertainment and connection to other people. it's wrong and its being stopped slowly but surely         		0
Dear principle,  I have heard that you want to make all students do community service. Well I do think that some of them are not wanting you to do that but me i do. In this letter i am going to give you some examples why you should make ever student do community service.  Well one is that some people need to take time out of there day to help there community. I think it will be a big help for the students to learn responsibility. It will also help the community to be clean and not have trash all over the place.  Here are some suggestions on some community service idea. cleaning up trash on the streets, helping out at the retirement home, and also helping out at the animal shelter. There are some examples on some that people do everyday. Me myself loves animals and would like to help out at the animal shelter.  Also it helps the student to take care of thing that he/she has. He/she will learn to not to throw out trash on the street because they will know what its like having to pick up trash on the side of the road. It will teach them to take care of there pets. Last but not least it will teach them to be kind to there elders and to take care of them, love them. It will teach them to take care of there elders at there house, there church, or at school.  Well this is my letter on why you should make students do community service.  Sincerely: A fellow student		0
Studying Venus Remains Valuable Despite Risks  The author makes a compelling case that exploring Venus remains a worthy scientific pursuit in spite of the planet's hazardous conditions. While Venus presents clear dangers to potential explorers and equipment, the article outlines several key ways in which valuable scientific insights could still be gained from Venus exploration.   To begin, the author notes the many unanswered questions that continue to motivate further Venus study. Exactly how and why did Venus evolve into an inhospitable planet with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead? Understanding Venus' transition could provide lessons about climate change and planetary evolution. The article also suggests Venus may harbor clues about the early history of Earth and other terrestrial planets. With its similar size and mass to our own, studying Venus may reveal much about Earth's pre-atmospheric state.  In addition, the author proposes several exploration strategies and technologies that could help mitigate risks on Venus. For example, future landers or orbiting craft may deploy aerostat balloons or aircraft to examine the Venusian atmosphere from elevations with more moderate temperatures. The article also highlights how cutting-edge materials, cooling techniques and autonomous systems could help probes withstand Venus' brutal environment much longer to achieve meaningful scientific objectives. While challenges certainly remain, these innovative approaches offer pathways to safely accessing more of the Venusian atmosphere and surface for research.   In sum, while Venus poses very real threats, the author presents a persuasive argument that its study remains scientifically important and potentially feasible with further technological progress. Even in a hazardous environment, much could still be learned about geological and atmospheric evolution from our nearest planetary neighbor. For these reasons, the pursuit of Venus exploration as outlined deserves continued support and investment despite the dangers involved. The author makes a valid case that the scientific rewards could outweigh the risks for expanding our understanding of basic planetary processes.		1
Distance learning is something that is in discussions all over the United States right now and could be an extremely useful tool. Online school is a fairly new way of getting an education and is mostly used by colleges rather than high schools. However, due to the recent outbreak of corona virus, online school is being used more often to help high school students get an education. Distance learning would benefit students greatly if there was a reason they couldn't be in a classroom or were better learners in there own house as well as if school were to close for some reason.  In online school you can't show mastery of the skill in the same ways you could if you were in a classroom, but there is other ways to prove your knowledge. In school you take tests to prove mastery of the skill or topic you've just learned. If you were doing online school, those same tests would be extremely easy, as you could just look at your notes. However, there are many other ways to show mastery of a skill. Teachers have proposed open note quizzes or an essay format type of test. They could also assign projects or slide-shows to force the students to actually have to research and learn about the topic they are supposed to be tested on. There are many ways you can show mastery without having to do a multiple choice quiz or test.  Online school is also an extremely convenient and is a great tool if school was unable to be open for some reason. Recently the corona virus has put a spotlight on online school as school systems are shutting down throughout the world to help contain the virus. Recently, Generic_City Public Schools had a board meeting to discuss the matter, and are closing for a day to help teach their teachers how to use some distance learning features and teach them how it would work. Online school would also be helpful on snow days. Since students are unable to come to school, teachers could use online school as a great tool to help teach their students. Distance learning has many great applications if schools are unable to open for any reason.  Some people would argue that distance learning would show no benefit and would make it harder to learn material being taught to you. I disagree because it much easier to learn when you are put under the intense stress of having to keep up with everything or being put on a strict hour and a half time-line. Not only that, but sitting in a hard chair all day without being able to really move or socialize can make it much harder to concentrate. At home it is much easier to relax, as you can sit someplace comfortable and quiet and make it easier on yourself to concentrate on the assignment, or what the teacher is saying. Distance learning makes it much easier to concentrate and makes it less stressful for the students.  Distance learning is a great tool we can use to help students get an education. Tests and quizzes can be taken just as easily, but in different forms like projects, to help show the students has mastered the skill. Online school is extremely convenient if school were to close down temporarily. Online school can also help relieve stress off the students and help them concentrate more on whatever they're supposed to be learning. 		0
What would you do if you got written a ticket by a police officer for just driving your car? It could happen if we had a day that driving was banned to help the environment. I think this is great idea and we shold all get involved with trying to make it work. Other countries have done it and it doesn't seem to effect anybody negatively. The only thing this would do is limit the pollution put off in America and all over.  Cars are probably the biggest source of pollution in our world today. We use cars for everything now and it is very convenient but have you ever really thought of what they are doing to our atmosphere and ozone. Smog is one of the biggest effects from driving and its not a pretty one. I wouldn't want my city to be covered in a thick layer of foggy gas fuems. In paris the smog was so thick they had to make driving outlawed for a few days just to keep it under control. If we did it even just a couple times a year nation wide it could really help.  In columbia they tried this to help with car emissions and everybody enjoyed it. They even said other countries joined in so I think its our turn to give it a try.  The people of Vauban, Germany have a pretty much car free town. If towns started going car free like this in America the emissions would drop greatly. In Vauban evrybody really likes not needing cars and say it is much less stressful than driving everyday. If just one in every 20 cities of the United States went car free we would notice how much cleaner the air is and the greenhouse effect or global warming would be almost nonexistent.  Another thing the articles mentioned is hybrid cars. I think hybrid cars are great, I personally have one, but some people don't really understand or like them. These cars could really help save the environment in just a few years if people were to start only using them. Which I doubt will happen but they still are driven by many people and its much better then everyone driving a diesel truck around all the time.  In all honesty I don't think any of this will happen here anytime soon but it sure would be nice. The greenhouse effect is very real no matter how many people argue about it and there is thigs that can be done to help prevent it. We just have to be willing to make some sacrafices to save our planet.		0
In "The Challange of Exploring Venus," the author supports' his claims on how it is dangerouse it is taking the risk to explore Venus. The author uses various facts, proven by scientests, to justify his explanation. In this he talks about how ships can hover over the planet but not land on it because it is too dangerous. Venuse is too dangerous to explore.  In paragraph 2 the author talks about how Venus is very similar to Earth in looks, but is very dangerous on the inside. He says how Venus's size and density is very close to of Earth. But then he says how all the mission was unmanned because of one reason, which was none of them survied for more than few hours. The text states, "Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survied the landing for more than a few hours."  Another reason that it is dangerous to explore Venus is because it is very hot on the surface and the pressure is too high. The pressure on Venuse is over 90 times higher than here on Earth. The Tempture on Venus in not too less either. It is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The author states, "On the planet's surface, temperatues is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."  Last reason for why Venus is wanting to be explored more is because we do not have a single sample for its surface. Our ships can hover over the planet and gather data of the atmosphere. But the atmosphere is too thick for light to go through. And as said before, the planet is too hot for a ship to last long enough on its surface. The text states, "However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions because most forms of light cannont penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photagraphy and vidography ineffective."  In Conclusion, our neighbor plant or twin planet Venus is too dangerous for several reasons. The heat and pressure on the planet is too much for our space ship and our boby to handle. Not much can be found out about the planet because of its temperatures and its atmosphere unableing us to take pictures of iis surface form safe distance.		0
Twenty five years ago a weird picture showed up in the Jet Propulsion Lab by a NASA's Viking 2 spacecraft. It took a picture of what seemed to be a human head on planet Cydonia. People in the Jet Propulsion Lab were surprised at what they saw. Though many thought it was something formed by aliens, scientists figured it was only another Martian mesa. They said the shadows is what made it look like a face.  The shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth, which made the Martian mesa look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Though it was said to be only a landscape on Cydonia, the news of the face went crazy. It starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines, and so on. Others thought that NASA would rather hide the true information of the face and just say it was the shadows which made us think it was a face.  Though, NASA defenders wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the face, which came out ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The picture revealed a natural landform; no alien monument.  It's not easy to reach Cydonia and therefore makes it difficult to get a picture of the so called face. Garvin said that you could see if there were small objects on Mars, therefore no alien civilization is on Mars.  This shows how the face on Cydonia is not a face, but a landscape. The shadows in the picture made the landscape appear to have a face that look human. Therefore, there are no alien artifacts on Mars. 		0
The call of the open sea.   Growing up in the small town of Burns, Oregon, I had always dreamt of escaping the confines of our ranch and exploring what mysteries lay beyond the horizons. The Seagoing Cowboys program was the perfect opportunity to turn those dreams into reality. Over the past summer spent sailing around the Pacific Northwest coastline, I experienced adventures more vivid than any movie could capture. Each new cove and inlet revealed untold natural wonders, from pods of playful orcas to cliffs teeming with hardy seabirds. But more than the landscapes, it was the people I met along the way that left the deepest impact.     Whether assisting fishermen to bring in their daily haul or swapping stories around the campfire with fellow seafarers seeking adventure on the briny deep, I found a sense of camaraderie unlike anything back home. Sailing teaches one true self-reliance too, as each crew member must pull their weight maintaining the vessel through all weather. Though the waves could be rough and rain endless at times, facing nature's challenges with good company by your side makes even the hardest tasks feel like play. At journey's end, I returned with a wealth of memories and skills that will stay with me for life.  For anyone longing to cast off life's shorelines and experience untapped freedoms, I cannot recommend the Seagoing Cowboys program enough. You won't find a better way to soak in nature's beauty, create bonds with an unforgettable community, and push yourself to learn more about who you are meant to be. So what are you waiting for? It's time to hoist the sails and let the horizon be your guide to adventure. The call of the open sea awaits - will you answer?		1
Dear Senator of the state of Florida,  I would like to propose you to keep the electoral college in regards to how elections are made for the presidency and vice presidency. I in my opion as well as in other feel that by keeping the electoral college decisions on votes would be satisfactory for us in due to th e couting of our votes for the elections that we face. It would be a much rather delightfulness for the state of Florida if you would keep on helping sustain the electoral college and its' bases of funtion as well as in the rightchesness that belongs in our votes for the candidates that run for election either for presidency or vice presidency. Further more I wish to ask you to maintain our votes fair in wich i mean don't do an unfairness of our votes that is to say, our votes that get sent to you so that you can put in the final vote. As you may know there are many hateful critcism on how the electoral college functions and I'd like to say that if you could put up with the so many critics and just keep doing your job on electoral college then you could put up a positive ad on how the electoral college really works so that the many people that crtisize and have doubts on how the electoral college will truely know what is happening with their votes for election times. Our nation really needs this even though it is a really old system of governmence towards our voted that fall in you hands. for instance in the article "The Indefensible Electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"(paragraph 14) it states "...The electoral college is...outdated" this shows how even an article was written to discuss the faults in the electoral collage and how its sytem works. the electoral collage may recieve many hateful critism on how fair the electoral collage is, but all in all their shouidn't be anything to worry about knowing that what you're doing is right in terms of governance and politics. With all due respect I would like to thank you for helping sustain the the electoral college with your fellow out of state caleeges, its a pleasure having having you as our Senetor and this goes as for everyone that enjoys your supportment to the government and how its electoral elections are based due to this system. I hope this really helps on how our government system on elections are critized, and that for at least there are people that actually hope for the prosper of the electoral college and the benifits that come out of it as also the many unlawful things that could arise in the nation if we didn't have and electoral college. With all due respects I hope that your manegment of our votes in elections be used wisely in the electoral college unlike other places in the world where much is corrupted and is used against the people instead of for the people. Thank you for taking your time in reading this article Senetor of Florida.    		0
Working alone often has a number of advantages over working in groups. For starters, it can be more efficient since you only have to consider your own needs and preferences. You won't have to waste time trying to work out group dynamics or compromise on decisions.   Additionally, it can be beneficial for students to work independently. Working alone offers them the opportunity to learn to think critically and come up with their own solutions. It also instills a sense of autonomy and responsibility, as there are no other people to depend on to complete tasks. When faced with a challenging problem, the individual is better equipped to simply focus on the task at hand rather than trying to coordinate a group.   Overall, I believe that it is often better for students to work alone than in a group. Independence and efficiency are both major benefits that can help to foster an environment of intellectual inquiry and personal growth.		1
Man conquered its environment with advancements and technology, they make life easier but some are harmful to our environment. Automobiles were derived from carriges but unlike carriges automobiles required some kind of power to run on. Most vehicles in modern day run on gasoline, Diesel, or electricity. They make transportation easier for us but like every good apple it has its rotten side. Fumes produced by the burning of Diesel and Gasoline are harmful to our ozone. The fumes produce a greenhouse like effect and trap in the heat contributing to global warming. Although diesel engines have improved and are now cleaner our atmosphere is still taking a sucker punch. Almost every family in the United States owns an automobile, thats millions and millions of people driving increasing carbon emissions. If less people used their personnal vehicle they could save money and diminish the amount of pollution produced by their automobiles. There is no way we can obliterate car use because we have built our world centered on car use but we don't have to stop driving we could simply reduce our impact by using public transportation, walking or riding a bicycle. Walking or driving a bicycle could relieve stress while commuting and traffic jams increase your stress level do something for yourself and our environment and decrease your stress level.  The are many many reasons to decrease our reliance on automobiles yet even with many benefits we refuse to do our part. The amount of fossil fuels available in earth is limited, in the past decades we have used much of it there will soon come a day when we will experience a shortage of fossil fuel. The day will come regardless of anything because of our reliance in this source of power but we can slow down its arrival by using less. Americans use thousands and thousands of dollars a year to fill up their tanks, when they could walk or car pool and save money. They could use that money to pay bills, make improvements in their home or make a college found for their kids. Yet many preffer to drive and just burn their money away. The use of public transportation doesn't only save you money it can increase your comminities economy.  While i'm all for saving money there is a greater cause then just saving money. Although is obvious we could all use a few extra bucks in our wallet we could also use a healthier planet. We breath in the fumes that automobiles produce, carbon is not good for us its a health hazard. We are polluting the air we breath our body needs oxygen not carbon and yet that's a high percentage of what our lungs inhale. There is also the concern that carbon emissions are causing holes in our ozone layer. The ozone protects us from all the harmful rays that the sun emmits like Uvrays. There has been an increase of people sufferring from skin cancer in the last decade. why you may ask, well carbon emissions make holes in our ozone layer which in essance allows harmful sun rays to reach us. With a certain amount of exposure to radiation our cells experience mutations caused by the harmful rays and essancially give birth to cancer. Many people die because of this disease and we lament their loss but not enough to make a change. Pollution produced by automobiles has many negative effects on our environment, and health. We could decrease the damage by doing our part and leaving our car parked in the garage.  If saving money and having a cleaner environment isn't a good enough reason to limit you car usage then do for your own health. There is more to life then just driving impatienlty in a car you could walk and enjoy nature. Our reliance on cars is unhealthy for us and our environment. We are polluting our beautiful planet and causing an increase of health hazards. There is only so much fossil Fuel left we can waste it all at once or make it last a little longer. I myself enjoy the pleasure of just driving to a store rather than walking but i preffer a healthy environment over a car ride. Do your part walk, take a bus, or car pool with your friends. Every grain of sand counts.		0
In the article “Making Mona Lisa Smile, ?author Lisa Feldman Barrett describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) enables computers to identify human emotions. By tracking the movement of facial muscles, FACS can decode the subtle expressions that convey our emotions, even when we try to mask them.   Facial expressions are a powerful form of communication, and the ability to read them accurately can have a significant impact on our interactions with others. In a classroom setting, FACS could be used to help teachers understand their students better and provide them with the support they need. For example, a teacher could use FACS to identify students who are struggling to understand a concept and offer them additional help. Additionally, FACS could be used to identify students who are bored or disengaged and find ways to engage them more in the learning process.  Of course, there are also some potential drawbacks to using FACS in the classroom. One concern is that teachers might use FACS to unfairly target certain students. For example, a teacher might assume that a student who is frowning is not paying attention, even if that is not the case. Additionally, FACS is not perfect, and it can sometimes misinterpret facial expressions. This could lead to teachers making inaccurate judgments about their students.  Overall, the potential benefits of using FACS in the classroom outweigh the potential drawbacks. By using FACS, teachers can gain a deeper understanding of their students and provide them with the support they need to succeed. However, it is important to use FACS responsibly and to be aware of its limitations.  In conclusion, the use of FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a valuable tool that can help teachers understand their students better and provide them with the support they need. However, it is important to use FACS responsibly and to be aware of its limitations.		1
Upon graduating high school, students are often faced with many potential career paths. One of the most popular post-secondary routes is to go to college to pursue further studies in a given field of interest. This can provide job opportunities in a variety of fields, such as accounting, engineering, and law. The benefits to this include the potential for higher salary prospects, greater job security, and the experience of pursuing more specialized training. On the flip side, there is also the financial commitment and technical aptitude required to complete some of these courses.  Alternately, students can take on an apprenticeship in order to receive on-the-job training in a desired field. This pathway provides the student with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience alongside more experienced professionals and a potential salary while doing so. The potential downsides to this approach are the initially lower wages compared to those of university graduates, and some jobs in this field may be harder to secure and stability may be lower in comparison.   It is important to ensure that students have access to a variety of career choices in order to assist them in making an informed decision. Schools should provide guidance to students in order to ensure they are educated on the various job opportunities available to them. It is important for students to attend school in order to gain a good education which can help them to achieve future success. With the right combination of post-secondary studies and on-the-job training, students can be encouraged to strive for a successful career.		1
Dear Principle,  As you stated in the first written policy , I think students should be allowed to use their cellular phones during social times like Lunch. I think that is a reasonable policy.  As long as the phones are shut off during learning times it should be permitted.  In school students can only communicate with those that are around them, but it is fair to say that not all students find the company of their fellow classmates enough to entertain them. Therefore students should be allowed to use cell phones which allow them to connect with other people they know and may share more things in common with.  Its nice to be able t have options for who you want to associate with during your free time. And cell phones widen the options of people you can communicate with.  Its not just a beneficial thing for students, but also to the parents of those children and family members. To be able to call your child during school to inform or remind them about something that may be personal is far better than having to call a school phone to speak to your child. There are pros and cons for having an available time set for people to use their phones. Things such as students not communicating with the people around them as much because they're too absorbed into their technology. Its a common case for young people today to get caught up into their phones and the internet and etc, but its their decision on how they should spend their time and we should grant them the opportunity to choose how they spend their social time. It feels good to have options.  As long as students are still able to learn and keep focused at the times needed in class, then cell phone usage should be fine. It'll just be a well deserved privilege for their hard work throughout the course of the year. But I do hope to see this policy take place.  Please take my word into consideration, its all that I ask. Thank you very much!  Sincerely,  (Your Student)      		0
I believe this would benefit students around the world, students would be able to attend classes from any school no matter where students live, this would help students who live far way from school and can't get a ride to school. Attending classes online from home would make it more comfortable for students.  Distance learning is good thing for students that want to study in school around the world or get the best education, students can be at home taking some classes that their country does not offer. Let's say a student lives in France and the student takes classes from United States, that's a good benefit, because you are learning education from another country in a different way that your country teaches you. This will be good for students who live in different country temporarily and are coming back to their countries.  The schools that offer distance learning are making life easier for some students who can't get education of they have to walk for hours to go to school. I remember watching a video about girl's life where she explains how far she has to walk though the mountains for 4 hours just to get to school. There are students who can't get education, because of the places they live, like places that are cold or far way from the city. This a good benefit in the United States since there's is a virus called corona virus in some states people are already effect with it, schools are closing cause of that students will be talking classes at home.  In school some students feel uncomfortable of working with their teachers or classmates, that makes students to stop working or lose interest on their work, but when they are home school students feel more comfortable, because they are at their house with their family, they feel more safe at their house and they can trust their family. In schools one of the main reasons why students feel uncomfortable of going to class is because some students get bully by their classmates, others get peer pressure to try to do things they don't like or be something they are not, making students not to be themselves. There was this famous video of a kid who was crying and told his mom that he wanted a knife to kill himself, he was just 7 years old, the reason why he wanted to kill himself is because many people at his school make fun him for being small, the students at his school were bullying him so much that he had to be home school and get therapist to help him get better and be comfortable.  At the end being able to attend classes at home depends if the students like it not everyone would think this is a good benefit for students others would think that is bad for students to take classes at home, because students will not get the chance to be social with other, this will make students not be able to work or talk with others outside in person, because they spent so much time at their houses taking classes by themselves. I have friend who used to be home school, now he goes to a high school and because he was home school, he doesn't talk that much in school, he doesn't have that many friends, it takes a while to get to know him. Taking classes from home is only good benefit if you want to take classes from another school, can't go to school because of where you live or it takes too long to walk to school, and if you don't feel comfortable in school, those are the main reasons students would taking classes from home. 		0
There are many different negavtives and positives when it comes to driverless cars. Knowing the goods and bads about these special cars can be good for the future when investing in one some day. Having a car that can drive itself, communicate with you and your actions, interact with how you drive could be a good thing. What if something was to go wrong? Being able to know how these things works and whats good and not so good about them could, never know, save your life.  These new and improved cars have positive things about them. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a car. Half a million miles is quite a lot without anything going wrong. it goes to show they can be reliable when wanting to drive a greater distance. There is more about these self-driving cars many dont know. Gm had developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in a danger of backing into an object. Therefor, the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.  Today, we don't exacly know how or what these self-driving cars are going to have in them or how they may run in the future. There are many positive things that have come upon us when investigating in this new invention but what could possibly go wrong? During the making of these cars there is a lot of technology and a whole lot of sensors. While driving thses cars, lets say on the highway, and something was to go out or mountfunction. Yes, it could happen to any vehicle in the world. The only problem is if the car itself is driving and something was to happen would the driver be able to take control or would the car freeze everything up an something bad happen? Google, BMW, and anyone else involved in this think of all the good possible things but there could be so many negatives that could really be lifechanging.  My opinion on Diverless cars is good for the most part. Say you have to drive a long ways and you need a break from driving, the car could take over instead of having to stop at night and drive for you. Its crazy to think that in a few years these cars could become our lives. "Telsa has projectd 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020." ( Driveless Cars are Coming.)  So, as you think more about it, most positive things could also be negative things when it comes to self-driving cars. In a few years havinng these cars could change our lives or make them harder. From the cars driving a half a million miles to having gadgits to help you focus on driving to not so much the technology problems that could cause bad news for a lot of people. Never know, one day we might have cars driving us around instead of us driving them.		0
Can a computer system percieve emotions of humans? The software that perseives the emotions of others has improved accurate descriptions of people. The Facial Action Coding System has percieved the emotions of Mona Lisa and has tryed to accuratly grade the percentage of each emoition from the picture. The program bases off of 6 basic emotions which fall in to more complicated catagories. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles no only expresses emotions, but also may help produce them.  The program is going off of the physical emtion but not the mental emotion the person is having. This flaws the percentages overall. Being another individual you can see what the persentages are and agree with them by looking at the picture in person. The mental emotion of someone may be a lot diffrent then what they are expressing physically.  In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System may be a bit flawed but has improved accuracy quite a lot. Even here is says, according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles no only expresses emotions, but also may help produce them. The system is very accurate when scanning others.		0
Hi there, my name is STUDENT_NAME I'm writing a letter to you today about the my concerns about the grades you need to participate in school sports.  A lot of people at my school try their very best with their school work, but just can't seem to keep that average B grade up. And I think it's unfair myself because I'm a C or B average student and I do try my best with my school work I'm on time for school turn my assignment in on time and study before any test quiz or exam I just can manage a B in every class even though i try extra hard.  Now what if I wanted to try out for a sport say.. Cheerleading for my school are you saying i wouldn't be able to participate in the after school activity just because I have two little C' s?  Now don't me wrong, i' d want better but a C is a passing grade but what if i tried out, so happens a made it, they same I'm one of the best cheerleaders on the squad then they check my grades and see that i have a 75% in science and a 78% in Social Studies those grades would be easy to bring up. But why take me off the team if I'm a great player? But then you let someone on the team with a 79% basically a high C, not a B though yet. Now that wouldn't be fair would it?  That's why I think if you have a C or better you should be allowed on the team with a C because if you are working hard and just have on C.  you should be allowed to be in a sport at school, that's why parks and recreation sports don't go by grades or try outs they just take your money and whatever you sign up for that season is exactly what you payed for, there aren't any limitations.  Those are my thoughts about your new "considerations" with the school sports dilemma.  From,  STUDENT_NAME.		0
No more sports?  What would school be like of there weren't any sports to keep you active? I think students that can maintain a C average shows that they are at least trying , maybe not hard enough but they are trying. Hands-on activities sometimes encourage students to want to learn, having fun may also make students want to come to school. Having rules for sports grade wise, sometimes make students especially boys want to do better in school so that their able to be or play on the team. Telling students that sports activities will be band will make them not care or want to go to school. School is for learning but there is also some room for fun, sports is the fun part of school. Of course some sports may cause students to get behind on homework because of practices, but the school can set up a program after school for students that play sports. A program that will allow them to get a better understanding of their work and a start on their homework. I know students shouldn't only think about doing sports but sometimes a sport can relief you and relax you. If a student isn't doing well in a class and they need special help outside of the classroom they can also attend the after school program. This program doesn't only have to be for the students that play sports. I say that the principal should let the students that's getting a C average play a sport and attend the program and if the after school program helps improve their grade that should show how much sports can make a person want to strive and learn more. Doing sports in school can show students what they are capable of doing. Some students might want to play a sport in college, but how can they discover their good at it if they have no way of playing it or being introduced to it. Most professional athletes started their career in high-school. And they played the sport every year until they got good and comfortable enough to be able to say "this is what i want to do with my life." "This is the career that will better my future."  That idea could also change her mind. I think of sports as a motivation to be able to participate in a sport and get my work done and maintain good grades. Sports can also make students healthy and active. If the idea doesn't work the students that aren't getting a C average should be issued some tutoring classes or help from their teacher.		0
 Title: The Virtues and Flaws of the Electoral College  The electoral college is one of the most significant aspects of the American political system. When the framers of the Constitution designed the system, the idea was that it would allow for Congress to have a voice in the selection of the president while still allowing for the president to be chosen by the people. While the system has its advantages, it has also been criticized for being flawed.  One of the main advantages of the electoral college is that it allows for the president to be balanced between the urban and rural areas. When the American people were first able to vote for their president directly, the urban populations often dominated the vote due to a large number of voters in cities. This meant that the voices of rural Americans were often ignored, and they had little say in the selection of their president. The electoral college provided a balance to this. Each state gets a certain number of votes based on its population, and thus rural areas have a voice in the selection of the president, although it may be balanced out by urban areas with larger populations.  Another advantage of the electoral college is that it provides stability to the system. Direct presidential elections can be unpredictable, and there have been instances where winners were chosen by a narrow margin of votes. The electoral college provides a margin of error, and there have been times where the winner of the popular vote did not become president. However, the winner of the electoral college is usually the president, providing a level of stability to the system.  Despite the advantages of the electoral college, there are also flaws to the system that need to be addressed. One of the biggest criticisms of the electoral college is that it can result in the candidate ignoring certain states. In situations where one candidate has an overwhelming advantage over the other in a certain state, they may not campaign in that state, leaving the voters there feeling unimportant. Additionally, certain groups of people may feel less involved in the electoral college process, as it is only concerned with the votes of individual states, not the overall population.  Another flaw of the electoral college is that it can perpetuate the belief that certain peoples or groups are more important than others. For example, white, non-Hispanic voters often outweigh the votes of everyone else. This can perpetuate discrimination against certain groups of people and reduce their representation in the political system. It can also lead to a perception that certain groups of people are more important than others and that their votes do not matter as much.  In conclusion, the electoral college has both advantages and flaws. It provides balance to the election system and allows for stability, but there are concerns around certain groups not feeling represented. The system needs to be evaluated continually, and adjustments made to ensure that all voices are heard and that everyone is involved in the election process.  Hence, any reform of the electoral college should aim to address its flaws and improve the system. A possible solution would be to implement a proportional representation system that would give each citizen an equal say in the selection of the president. This would provide a voice for each and every citizen, regardless of where they live or their race. Another solution would be to make national popular vote the primary criteria for winning an election. This would remove the state-by-state focus, reducing the influence of smaller populations on the election and ensuring that the president is elected by the majority of the country.  In conclusion, while the electoral college does have its advantages, it does also need improvement. As the world around us becomes increasingly globalized, we need to ensure that every voice is heard and every group is represented equally in our political system.		1
Technology has become an integral part of our lives, and its impact on people's lives is significant. The advancements in technology have brought about many positive and negative changes in various aspects of our lives, including relationships, buying items online, and spending time with family.  On the positive side, technology has allowed people to connect with others from different parts of the world, making it easier for them to maintain relationships. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have made it possible for people to keep in touch with friends and family who live far away. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to buy items online, saving them time and effort. Online shopping has become more convenient, and people can purchase items from the comfort of their homes.  However, technology has also brought about some negative effects on people's lives. For instance, technology has made it easier for people to become isolated and disconnected from others. People often spend more time on their devices than interacting with others, leading to a decline in face-to-face communication skills. Furthermore, technology has made it easier for people to buy items online, leading to a decline in local businesses and a loss of jobs.  Technology has also impacted how people spend time with their families. While technology has made it possible for families to stay connected even when they are apart, it has also made it easier for people to become distracted and spend less time with their families. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to work from home, leading to a decline in the quality of family time.  Furthermore, technology has allowed people to complete tasks without contact with others, leading to a decline in interpersonal skills. People often rely on technology to complete tasks such as ordering food, booking appointments, and paying bills, reducing the need for human interaction.  In terms of children, technology has become an essential part of their lives. Children often use technology to learn, play, and connect with others. However, parents should put limits on their children's technology use to ensure that they are developing the necessary interpersonal skills and maintaining a healthy balance between technology use and other activities.  In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on people's lives, bringing about both positive and negative changes. While technology has made it easier for people to connect with others, it has also made it easier for people to become isolated and disconnected from		1
Sure, here's my essay:  My Goal: Become a Proficient Programmer  As an 8th grader, I have always been fascinated by technology and coding. I want to learn how to code and become a proficient programmer. This goal may seem daunting, but I believe it is attainable with the right steps and resources.  Step 1: Set a Goal My goal is to learn how to code and become proficient in at least one programming language by the end of 8th grade. I believe this is a realistic goal because I have been exposed to basic coding concepts in school and have a solid foundation in basic math and problem-solving skills.  Step 2: Break Down the Goal To reach my goal, I will break it down into smaller steps. First, I will learn the basics of HTML and CSS, which are the building blocks of the web. Then, I will move on to more advanced languages like JavaScript and Python. I will also learn about different programming concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and software design patterns.  Step 3: Research and Learn To learn the necessary skills and concepts, I will use online resources such as Codecademy, Khan Academy, and Udemy. These platforms offer interactive coding lessons and tutorials that are easy to follow and understand. I will also watch YouTube videos and read books on programming to broaden my knowledge.  Step 4: Practice and Get Feedback Once I have learned the basics, I will start practicing by working on small projects such as building a personal website or creating a simple game. I will also join online communities and forums where I can get feedback and support from other programmers.  Step 5: Keep Practicing The key to mastering any skill is practice, practice, practice. I will keep practicing and working on projects until I feel confident in my abilities. I will also set aside time each day to practice and learn new concepts.  Step 6: Don't Give Up Learning to code can be challenging, and there will be times when I feel frustrated or discouraged. However, I will not give up. I will keep pushing myself and remind myself of my goal. I will also seek help from my		1
Dear principal,  I have heard that you are may start to not allow the student body not able to participate in activities such as sports, and or after school activities unless they have at least a B average. It is to say that most of the student body have at least a C. I disagree with this new rule for three reasons. The first reason is that some of the students in this school learn slower than others and may not get their work finished in time, this also is to say that it is not because they don't want to do the work but because they may be overly excessive with the quality with their work.  The second reason is that in some of the after school activities can help with the lack of work being done of the timing in the way that in some of the activities that this school has ,like sports, use math and reading which in the long-run will make the students grades superior .  The final reason is that some of the students may have disability's which may make their comprehension of what is being taught confusing and hard to know how to do that project. Most schools in North Carolina go by if the average is at least a C. i hope that you think about whatI have said about this topic which would impact the students in a big way , I also hope that you decide not to enforce this new rule .  sincerely, STUDENT_NAME      		0
Dear Senator,  I think that we should change over to election by popular vote. I thinks that because in the Electoral College the voters dont vote on the president, but instead they vote on the electors who then vote for the president. "It's official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. "The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense....it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. There are five reasons for getting rid of the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are preactical, not liberal or conservative reasons. Some people disagree though they think that we should stick with the electoral college. They think its a good way to do the voting because they get to choose the electors who will choose our president. Inconclusion, I think that we should do election by popular vote because then the voters get to choose the president.  Sincerly,  Britney    		0
Have you ever thought of how future cars may look like? With technolongy rapidly increasing each year, in the next couple of years cars might be the ones doing all the driving without the need of people controlling it. In other words, in the future there could be the invention of driverless cars. Now, do you think this would be a good idea or not so much? Well, in the article, Driverless Cars Are Coming, the author points out a few postitive and negative features.  Since a few years ago Google modifies a Toyota car into a smarter car. A couple of these upgrades involoved the wheels to include a sensor and a Dubbed LIDAR, which allowed the driver to be constantly notifies of the car/s surrounding. This it's self is very useful. It caused the number of accidents to decrease due to the driver being constantly notified. Of course these are all examples of postiive features of a car, but do not make the car completely driverless.  Another major feature was a development called, "Traffic Jam Assistant'. This new develpoment did not quite make the car completely driverless either. Although it did involve the driver not to control the car as much. This feature had the ability to get the driver where they needed to be as long as there was'nt any need for human skills. Even if there was'nt any need of human skills, one still had to be aware of the road. Mainly this feature made driving easier but not completely driverless.  Towards the end of the article the author points out a couple negative aspects. The author mentions that safety is best assured when the driver is in control of the car at all times. So, in reality having a driverless car would not be the best or safest idea. That is because, if complete driverless cars would come to invention the car would be completely running through technology. Technology is not always assured. The technologu that makes the car safely drive on its own may fail which will lead to an accident without the alert of the driver.  Overall, in my opinion I do not think driverless cars would be a good idea. I think it would lead the number of accidents per year increase rather than decreasing or staying stable. I do think having those new developments of technology are helpful into making the driver more caution though. These new developments still require the driver to be fully aware of the road and their surroundings. Unlike driverless cars, they would seem to allow the drivers to "relax". This would cause drivers not to have a quick response in case of an accident where the technololgy of the car fails or for any apparent reason. Driverless cars do sound fun and nice at first, but once you take your thoughts into more deepth I do think you would be second thinking your thoughts. Not only will this development cause one to put themselves in danger, but also other cars along the road wth them.		0
Having positive people around you is incredibly important for your self-esteem. The way you feel about yourself is greatly influenced by the people you surround yourself with. If you are constantly surrounded by negative people, it can be difficult to maintain a positive self-image. On the other hand, if you surround yourself with positive people, it can be much easier to feel good about yourself and your abilities.  One of the main benefits of having positive people around you is that they can help to boost your self-esteem. When you are around people who believe in you and support you, it can be much easier to feel confident and capable. These people can also help you to see your strengths and accomplishments in a positive light, which can be very motivating.  Another benefit of having positive people around you is that they can help to reduce stress and anxiety. When you are surrounded by negative people, it can be easy to feel stressed and anxious. This is because they may be critical or negative, which can make you feel like you are always under attack. On the other hand, when you are surrounded by positive people, they can help to reduce stress and anxiety by providing a supportive and positive environment.  However, even when you surround yourself with positive people, there may be times when you encounter negative people who want to change you. These people may try to make you feel like you are not good enough or that you need to change in some way. It is important to resist the temptation to let these people change you. Instead, you should focus on staying true to yourself and your values, and continue to surround yourself with positive people who support and believe in you.  In my own experience, I have found that having positive people around me has had a significant impact on my self-esteem. When I am surrounded by people who believe in me and support me, I feel much more confident and capable. I also find that I am less stressed and anxious, as I am able to focus on my strengths and accomplishments rather than being constantly criticized.  In conclusion, having positive people around you is incredibly important for your self-esteem. When you surround yourself with people who believe in you and support you, it can be much easier to feel confident and capable. It is also important to resist the temptation to let negative people change you, and instead focus on staying true to yourself and your values. By doing so, you		1
 Car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular as a means of reducing the environmental impact of transportation and improving the quality of life for citizens. In the past few decades, many cities around the world have implemented policies that limit car usage in order to create livable, walkable communities. In this essay, we will explore the advantages of car-free cities and why they are worth considering for our own communities.  One of the main advantages of car-free cities is that they help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, and limiting their use can have a significant impact on reducing air pollution. By encouraging people to walk, cycle, or take public transportation instead of driving, car-free cities can reduce these emissions and contribute to a more sustainable future. Additionally, car-free city policies can reduce traffic congestion, which can improve air quality and reduce stress levels for drivers and pedestrians alike.  Car-free cities also promote physical activity and a healthy lifestyle. By encouraging people to walk and cycle instead of driving, car-free cities can help residents get more exercise and improve their overall health. This can result in lower healthcare costs and a more productive workforce. Additionally, walkable communities can provide residents with access to fresh air, green spaces, and other amenities that can enhance their overall quality of life.  Car-free cities can also help to reduce urban noise pollution. Cars are a major source of noise pollution in cities, and limiting their use can help to reduce the overall noise levels in a community. This can make it easier for people to enjoy outdoor activities and improve their overall well-being.  Furthermore, car-free cities can promote economic development. By creating walkable communities with access to local businesses and services, car-free cities can encourage people to spend more money in their neighborhoods. This can help to support local businesses and create jobs, contributing to a stronger economy. Additionally, car-free city policies can help to reduce parking costs and make it easier for businesses to operate, which can benefit the local economy.  Finally, car-free cities can help to preserve historic and cultural heritage. Cars can damage buildings, monuments, and other structures, and limiting their use can help to protect historic and cultural sites. Additionally, walkable communities can provide residents with access to unique cultural experiences that are not available in car-centric environments.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer many advantages that are worth considering for our own communities. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting physical activity, reducing urban noise pollution, economic development, and preserving historic and cultural heritage, car-free cities can help to create more livable, sustainable communities. While there may be some challenges associated with implementing car-free city policies, the benefits are well worth the effort. As we work to create a more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations, it is important to consider car-free city policies as a potential solution.		1
I think that the school should be able to require community service because it will let the student's know that they are doing something right. Because some student's are very incosniderate , meaning they don't care. But if the principal decided to have it, then maybe it will change there minds and think to there selves that they are doing a good thing. And sometimes when you do good things for people, then they will do good things for you. Even if your doing a good thing period. It should make you feel good about yourself. I know this because i do good things for a lot of people. By helping them through things, talking to them if they need someone to talk to, and if someone doesn't get what to do or why they should do this, i say because right after you do this , it will make you feel good about yourself. I know it helps me! The best thing to do , is to do community service like every other day. And besides it would put a good example on our school. What i mean by that is , that it will make our school look nice and like we have good people that actually care. Some people in school are very rude and disrespectful to the teacher's sometimes. And they really don't deserve it because they help us through a lot and they make sure that we get our education and they help us when we need to stay after for school. We all need school though because if we want to get through life then we need to get through school and college in order to get a job and a house. For the students that are bad , then they should do community service when ever they get a referal. Maybe that will help them understand what they did wrong and it will help them figure out for themselves that they would rather off be good. There is no such thing as cool. People are people and the kids that think there "cool" , then they probably don't want to go through life. Because the people that do call themselves that , are most likely the bad ones. The kids that don't pay attention and that don't care. But why not have community service? Nothing's going to go wrong. The only thing that will go wrong is if we don't do it and the people that are acting up now are going to just get worst. That's why i think we should have it.		0
The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  Limiting car usage has been a growing trend in cities around the world, with numerous benefits for both individuals and the environment. This movement, known as "smart planning," aims to separate suburban life from auto use and promote alternative transportation methods. By reducing car usage, cities can address issues like greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and pollution. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage based on information from various sources.  One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article, "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars," passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By encouraging people to rely less on cars and using alternative modes of transport, such as walking, biking, or public transportation, cities can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and combat climate change.  Additionally, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion. Rosenthal mentions that automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, leading to increased traffic on roads. By adopting a "smart planning" approach and creating more compact communities with better accessibility to public transportation, cities can reduce the number of cars on the roads and improve traffic flow. For example, Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, has seen 57 percent of its residents sell their cars and 70 percent of families not owning cars, resulting in less traffic and a more peaceful and sustainable living environment.  Furthermore, limiting car usage can improve air quality and public health. In the article "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer, it is mentioned that Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution. Cold nights and warm days caused a layer of warmer air to trap car emissions, leading to smog and poor air quality. By reducing car usage and encouraging alternative transportation methods, cities can reduce air pollution, decrease respiratory problems, and improve overall public health.  Lastly, limiting car usage can lead to the development of more vibrant and livable communities. Andrew Selsky highlights in his article "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" that car-free days in Bogota, Colombia, have resulted in empty streets and improved quality of life. With fewer cars on the roads, people have more opportunities to walk, bike, and interact with others. This shift in transportation culture can lead to the creation of pedestrian-friendly spaces, better urban design, and the promotion of community interaction.  In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages for individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, improving air quality, and creating more vibrant communities, cities can become more sustainable and livable. While there are challenges and adjustments associated with limiting car usage, it is clear that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. As the trend towards reducing car reliance continues to grow, more cities around the world can embrace smart planning and develop into thriving, environmentally-friendly communities.		1
If there was projects over the summer, They should be constructively divided between the Teachers and Students, because there would be more creativity and fun for the projects. If you let either side take full or majority of the planning and development, it could be least interesting to either side. Lets say the teachers come up with a boring Science project to do over the Summer with a bunch of Worksheets, the students will not enjoy that. That being said the Teachers most likely don't want to grade too much work , they would prefer it to be simple and fun. Depending on age and grades, I believe grades 6+ should have students and teachers create projects and Ideas , It'd also allow the teachers and students bond a little more and help them with other school activities. Grades 5 and under should have summer projects but have more creative teachers in the role, considering the students are still very young. If you start giving students projects when they are younger they could develop and already learn those skills needed for projects and school work. Different schools, counties, and states can differ on such school activities. For most Schools and Counties they should be possible to do these projects it just needs a combined effort from both the Students and Teachers.		0
I disagree with the decision made by our principal that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While I understand the importance of being involved in extracurricular activities, I believe that mandating it for all students is not the right approach.  Firstly, not all students have the same interests or abilities. Some students may not be interested in sports, or may not have the necessary skills to participate in a team. Similarly, some students may not enjoy working on the yearbook or serving on the student council. By forcing students to participate in an activity they are not interested in, we may actually discourage them from getting involved in anything at all.  Secondly, some students may have other commitments outside of school that prevent them from participating in extracurricular activities. For example, they may have to work to support their family, or they may have family obligations that take up a lot of their time. By mandating participation in an extracurricular activity, we may be putting an unfair burden on these students and potentially causing them to fall behind in their studies.  Lastly, mandating participation in extracurricular activities takes away the opportunity for students to explore their own interests and passions. When students are forced to participate in an activity, they may not be as invested in it as they would be if they had chosen to participate on their own. By giving students the freedom to choose their own extracurricular activities, we are allowing them to develop their own interests and passions, which can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful experience.  In conclusion, while I understand the benefits of extracurricular activities, I believe that mandating participation for all students is not the right approach. Instead, we should encourage students to get involved in activities they are interested in and provide support for those who may need it. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and supportive environment that allows all students to thrive.		1
Distance learning means the ability to work from home, some schools allow students to do this. I disagree with this because students wouldnt be as focus as they are in regular school, students would get distracted easily, students would probably allow someone else to do there work for them, and students would be losing physical exercise.  Distance learning would have the students not focus and have them distracted because of other household actives. For example, say if the student is trying to complete his or her online classes, he or she can easily get unfocused because of a crying baby or even loud siblings. Another example, could be a students favorite TV show is on while he or she is completing his or her assignment they can get distracted and stop working just to watch the show. Instead of the student finishing there work he or she may have to do chores or even have practice for a sport that they may play. Students get distracted to easily just by other household actives.  With distance learning the teacher or Procter would never know whose doing the work. In regular school if the student needed help or had an question about an assignment the student could ask, but working from home the student may not ask for help he or she may just get someone else to do it for them. In that case, that means that the student is not actually learning. The student could not actually be watching the videos or doing the work he or she could just be clicking through them. An example could be, say if the student learns better with hands-on assignments and work, the student wouldnt be able to meet there standards because they do not have the proper help.  The students would be also losing physical exercise because instead of actually getting up in the morning and actually moving around, the student may just be laying in the bed all day. Another reason is that there wouldnt be any sports like track, dance, soccer, football, basketball, and a marching band if every thing was online. In regular school the students have gym and exercising, but with distance learning thats getting taken away. According to scientist in regular school you lose at least 5 to 10 pounds a week, and thats just by walking up and down the stairs and moving through the hallways. Physical exercise would be taken away with online learning.  As an result, I disagree with distance learning because it does not have an good affect on the students mentally and physically. 		0
Since the invention of the first automobiles, negative impacts such as greenhouse gases, and other environmental effects have plagued the world in a very short amount of time. Some people are taking action, like in certain cities such as Vauban Germany, paris and Colombia, by taking efforts to reduce the use of cars for transportation. ultimately, as people begin the shift from automobile transport certain economic, environmental, and societal advantages will benefit the world we live in today.  In Vauban germany, residents of the town are starting to take efforts in the first of "carfree" societies. To most people this idea could seem unpractical, but car free living can be very beneficial, to the environment and daily life. For instance, people in Vauban claim that they feel very tense when they own, and have to drive a car to and from places that they have to work. The layout of these cities like vauban, are unique because they are very dense, unlike the urban and suburban towns of america. This makes walking and biking a more easy method of transportation without having the negative effects of green house gases. In Bogota Colombia, residents are also realizing the the benefits that come with no cars, in which they have a car free day that spawns a whole new way of life. The new methods of transportation then become centered around bikes, walking, and other methods of non poluting transportation. This also leads to a benefit on the economy, by having 118 miles of bicycle paths built, new walking paths, restaurants, and shopping districts being created.  In Paris, nearrecords pollution caused by smog, forced city leaders to take action, banning all cars in a 2 day period and fining all violators of this new ban. This limited congestion in the capital by 60%. Free public transit was also issued for the exception of the ban, even though almost 4000 drivers were fined and some had their cars impound which certainly helped the number of pollutants on the streets. The smog cleared enough on monday, to where all odd numbered plates were free of the ban on tuesday. These notacable environmental effects were so substantial in such a short amount of time, that it could spawn a whole new wave of car banning cities to help thier local environment. If every city was based around this ideal, it would help their local environment, ultimatly helping their economic industries. Globally, this would make a huge change in the world wide market and decrease greenhouse gases.  The United States is also seeing a change in the amount of people that are buying fewer cars and driving less. These kinds of trends will ultimatly benefit the society if continued, by limiting carbon emissions. Although this would hurt the car industry, it would help other parts of the economy like agriculture and ocean based fishing, by helping these ecosystems to produce more effectivly. Places like New York also have bikesharing programs, which would have a impact on people's health too. Most people do not realize the postitive effects that daily exercise can have upon yourself. For example if every person in New york walked to where they work every morning new york would experiance a wave of healthy, happy, individuals. Even large car companies like ford are stating that pedestrain, bicycle, and public trasprotation save time, lower emissions and improve safety.  Overall, benefits of reducing car transportation is too great to be ignored. It is a step in the right direction that people are taking action and rising up for the greater good of their local towns and spreading awareness by these actions. Our future could go either way, we can continue on this path and do whats right for the environment, or neglect the earth we live on and face the consequences.		0
The opportunity to attend classes and avoid going to school sounds like an impossible luxury, but there actually is a way to act upon this fantasy. Through the large and expendable capabilities of the internet, there is a way to visually speak to teachers and professors through online video conferencing, or distance learning. Although students will not benefit from distance learning because some students may not have access to the internet or certain websites, students will benefit from distance learning because it is convenient, it will cause less distractions, and it will help them save money.  Now, most students would agree that going to school is a struggle or a hassle,even if they know that going to school will benefit their life in some way. Distance learning helps get rid of the struggle but still keeps the benefits that school has to offer. Distance learning is much more convenient because it allows students to learn and work from home without all of the useless presentation of school pride and school spirit. Distance learning allows students more time to get ready and be prepared for class by cutting out the time restraints and the asked questions. Students will find it easier to get on their computer or phone and start learning without experiencing the atmosphere that school forces upon them.  Secondly, distance learning helps students pay attention and listen to their teachers and professors because it is, usually, face to face with very little distractions. School provides many opportunities for distraction with school pride, rumors and gossip, and even fights (varies from school to school). School tends to bring out the worst in many students because of how strictly they dictate them while distance learning gives those students the freedom they were promised. The chance to learn without so many distractions could really help students retain more information and get a great education.  Finally, distance learning helps students save money on transportation and vehicle costs by being available at home. Most students that attend school acquire a car ride from a parent or friend, this increases unwanted wear and tear on the vehicle's tires and axles because of speed bumps and, usually, tight curbs. Most students have enough financial trouble as it is with supply and tuition costs (for college). Distance learning gives students the opportunity to learn from home, where no vehicle is required to take them there. It also saves money for students who have to use public transportation, such as the bus or subway. Distance learning is usually cheaper than an institution or university anyway.  In conclusion, distance learning will be beneficial to students because it is more convenient than going to school, it provides less distractions, and it helps them save money. In the future, the presence of distance, or online, learning will, more than likely, become much stronger and may even become more efficient than many universities and colleges. Students are urged to start talking to school administrators and professors about setting up online courses and websites dedicated to specific subjects of education.		0
Online Learning  Who doesn't want to be left in the house all day using an electronic device with online access? Although students save money and time by taking classes from home. It is not beneficial to learn online because students lose focus of what they are learning and tend to easily get distracted when they're in their house, students can't have a one on one conversation with a teacher nor discuss with classmates, and students could also face technical difficulties when attending online classes from home.  Losing focus has a big impact in learning. For example, my friend Generic_Name sent me a text message last month, right when I started studying for my history mid-term exam. I responded back to Generic_Name's text, and without realizing we kept on messaging past midnight. This shows how easily students get distracted at home with a cellular device and how easy it is to lose focus. The next morning I decided to get to school an hour early and review one on one with my teacher.  Secondly, taking classes online doesn't just mean you don't have a physical teacher or instructor that you can question lively, but also means that it will be challenging to find answers to your questions. I remember in my sophomore year a kid in our econ class named Generic_Name was really sick for a while so he had ended up taking classes online. Generic_Name was a straight A student, always was first to answer the teachers questions and he also used to ask questions. Thankfully Generic_Name healed towards the end of the year and I asked him if he benefited and if he recommends attending classes from home. The straight A student Generic_Name said it was a real challenge to take the class online and he finished the class a month after he should have with a B- average. Generic_Name had also said that one of the most difficult parts about attending a class online was his laptop not functioning at all times, and not having a teacher you can talk and converse with one on one.  Finally, using your personal computer and internet connection can always be an issue. You can't always depend on your computer, not just the computers but even people aren't perfect. Another main problem Generic_Name had when attending classes online was his laptop and network connection. Generic_Name explained that he always faced technical difficulties. When his laptop wasn't functioning right, the only thing he could do was to stop the lesson and wait for his dad to get the laptop repaired, which took time. Each month, either his laptop or internet connection would not cooperate, so he finished the class a month later than everyone.  In conclusion, Everyone would like to save money and time by taking classes from home. But getting distracted, not asking your teacher questions when you need to, and wasting money on laptop repair is not worth it at all. Learning from a far distance could also be an option but when asking if it is beneficial, we can say that it is not by looking at the listed reasoning.    		0
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student:  Hey, guys! Today we're gonna talk about how knowing multiple skills is way better than just knowing one. Like, think about it. If you're only good at one thing, you're pretty much stuck with that one thing forever. But if you know multiple things, you have so many more options!  For example, let's say you're really good at playing the guitar. That's cool and all, but what if you want to switch to playing the piano? Or maybe you want to try singing? If you know how to play the guitar, you can totally learn how to play the piano or sing! But if you only know how to play the guitar, you're stuck with that one instrument forever.  It's the same with sports. If you're only good at one sport, you might get bored with it after a while and want to try something else. But if you know how to play multiple sports, you can switch between them whenever you want! Plus, it's way more fun to play different sports and learn new things.  And it's not just sports and music. Knowing multiple skills can help you in school too! If you're good at math and science, but you also know how to write good essays and stuff, you're way more likely to get good grades. Plus, you'll have more options when you're applying for colleges and stuff.  So, in conclusion, knowing multiple skills is way better than just knowing one. It gives you more options and makes life way more fun. So, try to learn as many things as you can, okay? Thanks for reading!		1
 A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves  It is often said that people are drawn to the water due to its calming, soothing nature. However, not everyone has the skill and bravery required to navigate the treacherous waves. The cowboy, on the other hand, is known for his ruggedness and independence. He commands the land and the creatures that inhabit it. But could a cowboy also be one who rides the waves?  The idea of a cowboy on a surfboard may seem odd, but it is not entirely impossible. In fact, it has already been done. There are many cowboys who have traded in their horses for surfboards and have taken to riding the waves. What sets them apart from the casual surfer is their rugged nature and their unique approach to surfing.  These cowboys have spent their lives in the saddle, controlling the wild animals on land. The same skills they have honed in cattle herding and rodeo could be applied to the ocean. They know how to ride a horse and control it, they also know how to read and navigate a wave. The waves are powerful and unpredictable, but so are the animals they have spent time with.  The cowboy on the surfboard is a unique individual. He is known for his rugged nature and his independence. But he also knows how to take a risk and embrace the power of nature. He is a symbol of courage and strength, two qualities that are essential in any type of riding.  The ocean is a dangerous place, and the waves are no exception. But the cowboy on the surfboard is not one for fear. He is someone who is willing to challenge himself and take on the unknown. He is a free spirit, who is at home in the open water. He rides the waves with a sense of purpose and skill that is unmatched by any other type of rider.  In conclusion, the cowboy who rides the waves is a unique individual. He is a symbol of courage and strength, two qualities that are essential in any type of riding. He is someone who is willing to take on a challenge and embrace the power of nature. The ocean is a dangerous place, but the cowboy on the surfboard is not one to be afraid. He is not a cowboy in name only; he is a cowboy through and through.		1
 Car-free cities have become an increasingly popular concept in recent years, as concerns about pollution, noise pollution, and traffic congestion continue to rise. The idea of car-free cities is to create a city where automobiles are completely banned from the roads, allowing for a safer, cleaner, and healthier environment for residents. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits and challenges of car-free cities and explore the different approaches they take to promote public transportation and alternative modes of transportation.  One of the main benefits of car-free cities is the improved air and noise pollution levels. Cars emit harmful pollutants such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, which can contribute to a host of health problems such as respiratory issues and heart disease. Additionally, noise pollution from cars can be detrimental to health, causing stress and sleep disturbances. By removing cars from the streets, car-free cities can significantly reduce pollution and create a more livable environment for their residents.  Another advantage of car-free cities is increased public safety. Automobiles can be dangerous in cities, with accidents and fatalities caused by distracted driving, drunk driving, and reckless driving. Car-free cities can reduce these safety risks by limiting the number of cars on the road and encouraging public transportation and alternative modes of transportation.  Car-free cities also promote a more active lifestyle, as people are encouraged to walk, bike, or use public transportation to get around. This can lead to improved physical health, as people are more likely to engage in regular physical activity. Additionally, car-free cities can create more social opportunities, as people are more likely to interact and socialize with one another when they are using alternative modes of transportation.  Despite these benefits, car-free cities are not without their challenges. The biggest challenge is the lack of funding, as removing cars from the streets requires significant investment in alternative modes of transportation, such as public transportation and infrastructure. Additionally, there may be resistance to change from people who are accustomed to driving and are unwilling to give up their vehicles. Finally, enforcing car-free laws can be difficult, as there is always the risk that people will ignore the rules and drive on the streets.  In conclusion, car-free cities offer a range of benefits, including improved air and noise pollution, increased public safety, and a more active and social lifestyle. However, the challenges of implementing car-free policies must be addressed in order to achieve a safe, clean, and healthy city environment for residents. Ultimately, car-free cities are an exciting and innovative approach to urban development that has the potential to make our cities more livable and sustainable.		1
 The cowboy who rode the waves was a lone figure in a sea of chaos. He stood tall on his horse, a man of honor and determination, despite the roiling whitecaps that threatened to sweep him away into the vast, unknown depths. His weapon of choice was not a gun, but a trusty oar, which he used to steer his horse through the tumultuous sea.  The cowboy had been tasked with delivering a vital cargo to the other side of the ocean. It was a mission that required not only strength and skill, but also bravery and perseverance. The cowboy knew that the journey ahead would not be easy, but he was up to the challenge. As he set sail, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and fulfillment. He was a cowboy, a man of the wild and untamed lands, but now he was a cowboy who rode the waves, a cowboy who dared to conquer the ocean.  As the hours passed, the cowboy and his horse made their way through the treacherous waves. The ocean seemed to be in a constant state of turmoil, with towering waves that seemed to stretch up to the sky. But the cowboy remained calm. He knew that the key to survival was to keep his eyes on the wave he was riding, to ride in sync with it, and to never lose control. And so he rode on, for better or worse, into the heart of the storm.  But despite his best efforts, the cowboy soon realized that he was not alone. Sharks, dangerous creatures of the sea, had caught a whiff of his blood and were closing in fast. The cowboy knew that he had to act quickly if he wanted to survive. With a well-timed stroke, he plunged his oar into the water and drove away the predators.  Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the cowboy and his horse emerged from the chaos and into calm waters. They had made it. The cowboy felt a surge of relief and a sense of accomplishment. He had ridden the waves, a feat that few had ever achieved before. He had overcome the challenges and emerged victorious.  As the cowboy rode towards the shore, he couldn't help but think about the journey he had just completed. He had faced the wild and untamed ocean, and he had emerged victorious. He was a cowboy who rode the waves, a cowboy who had conquered the sea. And that was a title that he would wear with pride, for the rest of his days.		1
 Dear Senator,  I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While I understand the concerns of those who advocate for a popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that make it a better system for our country.  Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that every vote counts. In a popular vote, the candidate who wins the most votes in a given state or district wins the entire state or district, regardless of the number of votes received. This means that voters in smaller states or districts have less influence over the outcome of the election. In contrast, the Electoral College provides each state with a proportional amount of electoral votes based on its population. This means that every vote counts, regardless of where it is cast.  Secondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign nationally, rather than just focusing on a few key states. When candidates are running for president, they need to win over voters in every state, not just in a few key swing states. This means that candidates are more likely to campaign in areas where they may not have been previously active, which can help to bring attention to important issues and provide voters with more information about the candidates.  Thirdly, the Electoral College provides a system of checks and balances that helps to ensure that no single region or group of voters has too much influence over the outcome of the election. In a popular vote, a candidate who wins in a few key states or districts could still win the election, even if they lose the majority of the votes nationwide. This means that the candidate who wins the popular vote may not necessarily be the best choice for the country as a whole. The Electoral College, on the other hand, provides a system of checks and balances that helps to ensure that the candidate who is elected is the one who is best suited to lead the country.  Finally, the Electoral College is a system that has been in place for over two centuries, and it has proven to be a stable and effective way of electing the President of the United States. While there may be some benefits to a popular vote, the Electoral College provides a system of checks and balances, ensures that every vote counts, and encourages candidates to campaign nationally.  In conclusion, I strongly support the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While there may be some benefits to a popular vote, the Electoral College provides a system of checks and balances, ensures that every vote counts, and encourages candidates to campaign nationally. I urge you to continue to support this important system.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
One of the most influential quotes of all time, Thomas Jefferson said "Determine never to be idle". To this day, it remains a timeless piece of advice for those looking to make the most of their life. By being active and responsible, people can make progress towards the goals they set out to accomplish. Allocating time wisely and making responsible decisions can open up doors to opportunities that may have otherwise been missed. If one chooses to be idle, the effects can be detrimental. Time wasted and goals not achieved can lead one to feel unmotivated and incomplete.   Although it is tempting to think that sometimes it is better to do nothing, doing nothing rarely brings substantial benefits. It is more rewarding and beneficial in the long run to be proactive and take initiative towards what you truly desire. By stepping out of one's comfort zone, new paths open allowing one to become the best version of themselves. Therefore, I agree with Thomas Jefferson's sentiment and believe that it is crucial to be determined and never idle.		1
 Venus, often referred to as the Earth's "sister planet," is a place of constant fascination for scientists and space enthusiasts alike. This planet, located just eight million miles from Earth, is roughly the same size as our home planet, and is shrouded in mystery and intrigue. But why do we want to explore Venus? Why is it important to understanding this dazzling, yet dangerous planet?  Firstly, exploring Venus can further our understanding of the formation and evolution of our solar system. Scientists believe that Venus and Earth share a similar history, with both planets forming in the same solar disk and experiencing similar growth and development. By studying Venus, we can gain valuable insights into the early universe and how our own planet came to be.  Secondly, Venus can help us study the effects of extreme environments on life. On Venus, temperatures can reach up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it is covered in thick, toxic clouds of sulfuric acid. These conditions are far removed from anything we have on Earth, and yet scientists believe that life may still exist on this planet, in some form. Studying Venus can help us understand how life can survive in the most inhospitable environments, and what the future might hold for life on Earth as conditions continue to change.  But exploring Venus is not without its dangers. The planet's thick atmosphere, coupled with its extreme temperatures and crushing pressure, pose a significant challenge to any spacecraft sent to explore its surface. In fact, no spacecraft designed for manned missions has ever been sent to Venus, with the last successful unmanned mission taking place in 2010. Any future missions to this planet would require state-of-the-art technology and a deep understanding of the dangers it presents.  Despite these challenges, the desire to explore Venus remains strong. Scientists and engineers are constantly working to develop new technologies that will allow us to safely and effectively study this mysterious planet. The drive to understand Venus, and our place in the universe, is a testament to the human spirit of exploration and discovery.  In conclusion, exploring Venus is important for a number of reasons. It allows us to further our understanding of our own solar system, study the effects of extreme environments on life, and push the boundaries of what is possible. While the journey to this dazzling, yet dangerous planet is fraught with challenges, the desire to explore it remains strong, and with each new discovery, we come one step closer to unlocking its secrets.		1
Students already have to face the embarrasment when we have to talk in front of the classsroom. We dont want something like a computer to tell us. However the technology can help us detect other thing such as in art,to get more of a pricise emotion and face expression.  Most sudents like to keep quite to themselfs. The pressuer of fknowing that someone else migh know how you feel is scary. There are things that we dont not like to share and to me my emotions are hiding. They used Mona Lisa as an exampel of how they deteced her face there is one benifit where that technology can be used. In finarts. That I do agree with.  Another benifit that can help is a theater teacher to help select the actors that use the right emotion and it will make the play/movie even better. This can be taken in a whole lot diffent ways.  In conculsin i disagree with the fact that it may leave other students in embarrsedment but i also see how far we can take it.   		0
"All of our developement since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change" Said David Goldberg. Nowadays Cars are our main Source when it comes to transportation.  Limiting your car usage should absolutely be more important in todays society. It's Plently of things going on around us that most are unaware about, And limiting your car usage can be one thing to start helping to prevent these issues. Most cars give off alot of Pollution in the cities you live in an that effects animals. For example: The oil spill was a major problem in the ocean and that killed alot of animals an Demolished most of the sea life environmental foodchains. The capital of France had an intensifying amount of smog, but car traffic tended to decreased 60%  after 5 days. Beijing China was known as the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel Fuel was the blame. You could even try those cars that dont require gas so the cities could be less polluted, But theres disadvantages to those cars as well.  At one point of time gas prices were sky high and people weren't really satisfied with it. Now Gas prices have decreased an people are even more satisfied an happy to get gas. Saving up on gas would help out alot to in todays world as well. How? Because Everything in life has a Big Fat Price tag on it so to help save up to get better things or things you need you can probably go for not paying for Gas as much. Everyday around 5:00 or 5:30 there's something called 5:00 traffic. When everyone is just about getting off work, headed to night school, going to the store, or whatever the case may be. This is the craziest time of the day to drive an your just ready to get home an dont feel like dealing with traffic.... you can take the City bus, Subway, or maybe even walk if its not far. Some people may call you crazy but it reduces the amount of money being spent on gas. its only maybe like 10cents to ride the city bus i believe...But the point is your saving money. Then by the time you finally decide "Oh i would like to drive my car" your tank would be full cause you havent been driving it so you wouldnt have to stop for gas. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting " Car Reduced" Communities, and Legislators are starting to act. Many Experts expect public transportation to play a Larger Role in a new 6 year federal transportation bill approved this year, Said Mr. Goldberg. Walking isnt always quite bad. Look on the bright side your Burning Calories, shedding pounds, and if you run your building you Endurance. Instead of having to drive to a gym far away walk to a nearest one an have a pre workout by jogging or running there. Same thing applies to Bicycling.  Nowadays since majority of the United States own cars Traffic is horrible at certain hours of the day. Most people are too impatient for the wait or become aggressive drivers which is most likely to cause accidents. Maybe your ready to get home after a horrible day or your really tired from work an you realize your about to run into 5:00 Traffic an it'll be forever until you finally get home. If taking the City Buses or subways you won't have to deal with all that pressure. On a City bus you can just have a seat chit chat with other people as they hop on or just relax until you get to your destination. If your really tired you could just tell someone to wake you up when its time to. At least it'll be better then you being behind the wheel. If your workplace is Walking or Bicycling distance then you should feel even better to just scroll past all the people having to deal with the traffic. "Its a Good opportunity to take away stress and Lower Air pollution" Said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat Bicycle with his wife.  Fellow Citizens should understand the Advantages of limiting their car usage because of the Pollution, To Save up on gas, and Less stress to deal with Traffic. Maybe one day cities would take more action an save up on gas for these reasons.                                                                                                                                                		0
I'm against schools that allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. Firstly, it's an invasion of privacy. Students should have the right to keep their grades and attendance private, especially if they're doing well. It's like having a permanent report card that anyone can access. That's not cool.  Secondly, it puts too much pressure on students. If parents are constantly checking in on their kid's grades, it can make them feel like they're being watched all the time. It's like having a digital babysitter. That can cause a lot of stress for students who are already trying to balance school and other stuff like sports, work, or just hanging out with friends.  Thirdly, it's not fair to students who don't have access to the internet or whose parents don't know how to use technology. Some families don't have a computer at home, or their parents might not be tech-savvy. It's not fair to penalize those students just because their parents can't get online.  Lastly, it's a waste of resources. Schools should focus on teaching us stuff, not on creating fancy websites for parents to monitor us. I mean, come on, my math teacher barely knows how to use a computer. Do we really want to pay him to sit around all day updating grades online? No thanks.  In conclusion, schools shouldn't let parents monitor their kids' grades and attendance online. It's an invasion of privacy, it puts too much pressure on us, it's not fair to everyone, and it's a waste of time and money. So, let's just stick to the old way of doing things, like actually talking to our teachers and parents face-to-face. That way, everyone wins.		1
Being somebody else can be a powerful tool in achieving our goals, avoiding conflicts, and living in various environments. By temporarily adopting a different identity, we can gain a new perspective on a situation and better understand the experiences of others. This can be especially useful in situations where there is political conflict or where cultural differences may be a barrier to understanding.  One example of the importance of being somebody else can be seen in the political conflict between Donald Trump and Democrats. By putting ourselves in the shoes of someone on the other side of the political divide, we can gain a better understanding of their beliefs and motivations. This can help us to find common ground and work towards a more inclusive and understanding society.  Another example of the power of being somebody else can be seen in the practice of American secret service agents disguising themselves as Muslims. By adopting a different identity, these agents can gain access to sensitive information and better understand the experiences of Muslim communities. This can help to increase understanding and foster relationships between different groups.  There are many other examples of the importance of being somebody else. For example, by adopting a different accent or dialect, we can better understand and communicate with people from different backgrounds. By wearing a different piece of clothing or hairstyle, we can better understand and appreciate the experiences of people from different cultures.  Overall, being somebody else can be a powerful tool in achieving our goals, avoiding conflicts, and living in various environments. By temporarily adopting a different identity, we can gain a new perspective on a situation and better understand the experiences of others. This can help us to find common ground and work towards a more inclusive and understanding society.		1
Attending classes at school provides unique advantages not available through online classes. For example, attending school provides students with face-to-face communication with their peers and instructors. Additionally, a physical campus allows for collaboration between students in groups which can be difficult to replicate online.   On the other hand, taking classes online has its own advantages. It allows students to learn from any location, providing a greater degree of flexibility than attending classes in person. Moreover, online classes might be more accessible in terms of price and having higher technology-related requirements in order for the student to attend their classes.   If everyone took classes online, schools would face the challenge of fewer students attending. This could lead to fewer resources available for students, a possibly reduced class selection, and the disruption of field trips and extracurriculars due to lack of participation. Ultimately, this could lead to decreased school spirit and a feeling of disconnect from the school community overall.		1
The Development of Driverless Cars  While driverless cars offer convenience and safety benefits, their widespread adoption also poses risks that require careful consideration. According to the article, autonomous vehicles could reduce traffic accidents by up to 90% since most crashes today are caused by human error. Without drivers to become distracted, tired, or impaired, these cars aim to navigate roads safely using sensors and software. However, the technology is still untested at scale, and hackers represent a danger if they manage to interfere with vehicle systems.   More testing is needed to validate the software's ability to handle unexpected situations appropriately. The article questions whether autonomous cars can identify uncertain scenarios as well as human drivers. While sensors may detect obstacles, interpreting unusual conditions still poses a challenge. Before driverless cars dominate roads, their decision-making protocols must prove reliable even when encountering situations unlike what programmers anticipated. Lives depend on the technology performing flawlessly.  Public distrust could also delay widespread acceptance. Many people may feel uneasy relying on artificial intelligence instead of personal control for transportation. Hackers targeting autonomous systems increase anxieties about digital security and privacy. Gaining trust requires automakers and tech firms to prioritize safety and shield vehicles from cyber threats through engineering practices and legally enforced protocols.   In conclusion, while driverless cars offer safety advantages over humans when functioning properly, uncertainties remain regarding emerging technologies and public perception. Before self-driving vehicles become standard, developers must assuage concerns about how the software handles intricate dilemmas and prove resilience against hacking through rigorous testing and regulations. With a careful, evidence-based approach that prioritizes security over speed to market, autonomous transportation could ultimately prevent many car accidents if implemented responsibly.		1
I do agree that some students would benefit from online classes, but not all of them would. There's people that learn better if they are in a classroom with a teacher standing in front of them. There's also people who struggle to listen correctly in the classroom. Those are the people that would heavily benefit from an online course. All of their distractions are eliminated and they can turn the volume up on their laptop if they struggle to listen. There are benefits from both being in a classroom and being in an online classroom.  Since I agree that some would benefit, let's talk about why it's only "some". If you are like me, you would rather be in a classroom with other students who are learning the same things as you. Therefore, you can ask them for help if you missed something or just have a conversation on the topic. Just talking to others about what you're learning will grow your knowledge on the subject and you might even teach them a thing or two. This will also give you a chance to talk with the beautiful girls in your class!  So, why are they both beneficial? I've never taken a class online, but it must be nice to bring the class wherever you want. So, if you're an on-the-go student, I would look into online courses. Anxiety is a big thing these days and I've heard of many people with "classroom anxiety". They are actually afraid to go to school and I cannot think of a better cure for that than online classes. On the other hand, people in the classroom can speak on the subject and teach each other new things as I said before. You have the luxury of asking the teacher for assistance. Being in a classroom also improves your people skills.  We all know there is good and bad that come from online courses. These are some reasons why people think there is no good coming from it. You may not get the full learning experience from looking at your laptop rather than having someone with all the answers speaking to you and making you write them down. You have no social life while you're learning and you can't speak with classmates to learn more or get answers for a homework. If you're online learning, everything is on you! There is little help that comes with online classes rather than a real classroom.  All in all, I agree that some students would benefit from online classes. Those who are very independent and portable would love online classes. I feel that there are more students who would rather stay in the classroom and converse to learn more. It's all about what each person prefers. Online courses are not for everyone but are definitely a great option.		0
Thier are a bunch of reasons for not using a car I can name you 10 off the top of my head. It limits pollution saves money great excerise thier multiple reasons not to drive a car everday.  For example if you limit your car use to 3 times a week you would save a ton of money. Also you would help get rid of pollution as it states in the article "Pairs bans driving due to smog" that congestion was down 60 percent in the captial of france after 5 day of intensifiying smog. That happened after five days the smog cleared up enough and they let people start driving again. Also if you limit your car use you could start doing some excersie which is great because the rate of obesity may drop. Also if you limit your self from driving you are less likely to be in a car acciedent.  In the passage "car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" that they for one whole day dont use cars. They instead ride bikes every where because they want to reduce smog as Pairs wants to. In the passage it says that since its such a big hit that two more colombian cites, Cail and Valledupar joined the event. They have built over 118 miles of bike paths, the most of any latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. It also says that "the rain hasn't stopped people from participating," said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Also that day lets people probaly enjoy life way more because all you can do is ride bike and walk so they probaly go on adventures.  The final reason why you limit car use is thier would be less of a chance for you to get hurt or even worse. Thier are many acciedent evey year because of drunk and reckless drivers many have lost thier lives to idiots on the road. Thier was a story on the news that three teenage kids died in a car acciedent because they where under the influnce of drugs. They could have hurt other people the reporter said they crashed into a store and the store owner almost got hurt. Those kids almost took someone else life which is scary but if you limit your car use thier wont be that many acciedents.  All in all if you just limit your use of the car you can be helping out a bunch. The pollution can be reduced not as many car acciedents you can save your self some money. Also you can get more excersie in if you dont use your car that often.                       		0
The laws regulating driving while on your phone may be subject to primary enforcement or secondary enforcement by state, county or local authorities. Driving while on your phone can be very dangerous not only is it illegal but it can take your life.  Reason I say this is because driving while on your phone can be very dangerous you may say "I know what I'm doing" but them mostly be the people that's being injured, most people lost their lives or end up being in car accidents because of driving while they were on their phone it's not safe and it will get you hurt .  Due to the number of accidents that are related to conducing calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. State have enacted laws to ban handheld mobile phone use. Nevertheless, many allow use of a Bluetooth like where you can talk on the phone without touching your phone that may be excused but people like to hold their phone while driving to text.  In conclusion texting while driving is not safe and can cause many accidents and bad injuries therefore you can make it wait if it's an important call at least pull over to answer the call don't risk your life trying to be on the phone for an unknown reason.   		0
Did you have to do a project over the summer for school? If so that assignment was called a summer learning project and it's used to make sure students are learning over summer break. Although some might argue that the project should be student-designed, it should be a teacher-designed.  Students being able to design their own summer projects would not make the project a leaning experience. A student would do the project on a topic that he/she already knows about instead of leaning something new because he/she would want to hurry up and go outside to enjoy the summer. For example, if a student already knows about the great depression and has to do a project on the topic about devastating things that has happened to the American economy he/she would write about the great depression because they already know what happened. There would be no need to go the library or research anything or learn something new. Teachers pick projects that will challenge his or her students to excel not only in the specific subject that he/she teaches but in life also.  Teachers assign projects that will help their students do better in his or her class. For example, English teachers will assign a student a book to read that will have a theme that will be talked about throughout the entire year. Which allows students to be prepared in class and even do better in class because of the knowledge that they have gained by doing the project. Students will already have some insight on what the teacher expects and how they run their classroom based on the summer reading project.  Teachers pick projects that keep students up to date on what's happening in society. Government teachers assign summer project that help students learn laws that can keep them safe and away from prison and also help save others. It also helps them learn about their state Governor and how they are helping the people in the city that they live in and how they can help bring about change to things that they might not like. Teacher based projects keep students connected with the outside world.  Teachers should also pick the summer projects because it teachers student how to follow directions and how to be independent. It helps students learn how to only rely on themselves and not anyone else because you can not ask the teacher for help. The student has to learn how to do it themselves which is a skill everyone needs, it also teaches students how to follow directions, teacher gives out a rubric and the students must follow the rubric to get a good grade. If each student designed their own project each project would be different which would be thought for the teacher to grade and come up with a rubric for.  Teachers should pick the summer reading because they only want what's best for their students. It helps them: learn,stay connected with the world, learn independence, and be an overall great student. If teachers keep picking the summer projects future students will become the important hard working men and women that will eventually run the world.		0
 I believe that a homework club would be an excellent addition to our school. Many students struggle with certain subjects, such as math or science, and would greatly benefit from additional help. With a homework club, students would have the opportunity to receive extra assistance from teachers and peers, which could help them better understand the material and improve their grades.  Teachers are often willing to provide additional support, but some students may feel uncomfortable asking for help. A homework club would provide a more structured and comfortable environment for students to seek assistance. Additionally, the club could offer a variety of resources and materials to aid students in their studies.  While there may be some potential drawbacks to consider, such as the time and energy required to teach slower learners, I believe that these challenges could be overcome with careful planning and effective communication. Furthermore, many students have after-school activities and may arrive late to their commitments, so it may be necessary to offer flexible scheduling options for the homework club.  One potential issue could be a lack of volunteers to lead the club. However, I believe that with some outreach and promotion, it may be possible to find enough teachers and other volunteers to support the club. Additionally, the club could be run as a rotating leadership model, with different teachers or volunteers leading the club on a weekly or monthly basis.  Overall, I believe that a homework club would be a valuable addition to our school. It would provide students with the support and resources they need to succeed academically, while also promoting mental health and well-being.		1
The Face, made by aliens or just a natural landform? The Face, believe it, is just a natural landform on Mars. Why, the Face, is a natural landform is because, for one we do have images of this landform, the Face is also like a natural landform we have here on earth, and if there was an ancient alien civilization on Mars it would benifit NASA, so why think we're hiding anything? Maybe there was once aliens, but the facts just don't prove that to be true, therefore it is indeed just a natural landform.  We do have many images of the Face. The very first one that was taken in 1976 does indeed look like a face, but over the years wtith new technology it doesn't look like a face anymore. Now you may say that it's because of erosion and blah blah, but it's not. It has always been just a mesa which is very common on Mars, "New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASAs Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa." With our better technology it clearly shows that it is indeed not a face, therefore maybe you should stop believing it is.  The Face, is like one of the natural landforms we have here on earth. These natural landforms are natural occuring lava dome that took the form of an isolated mesa and they look about the same as the many that are on Mars. "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. All in all, Garvin is a real, bona fide scientist, so why not believe him?  If that still didn't convince you then this might. Simply if there was ever life on any other planet in our solar system we, NASA, would highly benifit from it. We would be able to study them and learn everything about them. So why would we hide it? Well we could if they, the aliens, didn't feel very comfortable with us telling everyone about them wanting to go see our leader and what-not. "Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Marsevidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars." Yes we could be hiding it from you for their sake not ours, so before you think that we're hiding things from you for us think about the aliens too.  Sure maybe we're all wrong and in the end you were right and there were once alien life forms on Mars, but that simply can't be true. The things we have; the images, an example of one here on earth, and the realization that if there were ever life forms on Mars it would benifit NASA and everyone else on Earth. So if you would please take your skeptical specticals off and realize that not everything you think is right is right, because maybe you're wrong. Who knows though there could be aliens out there on Mars hiding or maybe they're watching us as you read this.		0
Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  Limiting car usage can have numerous benefits for both individuals and the environment. As demonstrated by various examples around the world, such as the German suburb of Vauban, the city of Paris, and Bogota in Colombia, reducing reliance on cars can lead to improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and enhanced quality of life.  One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on air quality. Cars are a major source of pollution, emitting greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. In Europe, passenger cars alone are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some areas of the United States, this number can be as high as 50 percent. By reducing car usage, especially in suburban areas, where cars are a necessity for many families, we can significantly decrease the amount of pollution in the air.  The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is not the only environmental benefit of limiting car usage. Cars also contribute to smog, which can have detrimental effects on human health. The city of Paris implemented a partial driving ban during a period of intense smog, resulting in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and improved air quality. Similarly, Bogota in Colombia has been promoting car-free days, during which millions of Colombians use alternative modes of transportation such as biking, walking, or taking public transit. These initiatives have had a significant impact on reducing traffic congestion and improving air quality in these cities.  In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to an improved quality of life for individuals. The German suburb of Vauban, for example, is a car-free community where residents have given up their cars in favor of alternative modes of transportation. This has resulted in reduced traffic noise, safer streets for pedestrians and cyclists, and a greater sense of community. Residents report feeling less stressed and happier as a result of not owning a car. Walking and cycling are not only healthier forms of transportation, but they also allow people to interact with their surroundings and each other in a way that driving does not.  Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. By reducing reliance on cars, we can prioritize and invest in public transportation systems, making them more accessible, efficient, and reliable. This can lead to cost savings for individuals, as they would no longer need to spend money on car ownership, maintenance, and fuel. Cities like Bogota have seen the positive economic impact of car-free days, as businesses such as bike-sharing and carpooling programs have emerged and flourished.  In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing reliance on cars, we can improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance quality of life, and even stimulate economic growth. As demonstrated by various examples around the world, it is possible to create communities and cities that prioritize alternative modes of transportation and decrease dependency on cars. It is important that we continue to promote and adopt such initiatives to create a more sustainable and livable future.		1
Some schools have summer projects for their students to ensure continuation of learning. While the continuation of learning is good, what's keeping the projects from becoming overwhelming and eating up precious summer time that could be used for a number of other things? Looking at things from this viewpoint, the idea of the projects being student-designed can bring forth a less time consuming project that can also be appealing to the students.  Projects take time to do. Especially if it's a big project. These projects, if not being ignored by the students, cut into the time that students have over the summer to do things like relax, meet up with friends, work a summer job or go on a family vacation. Teachers don't know what students do in the summer, so letting the students design the projects allows them to conform to the schedules of the students over the summer.  Teachers tend to not really know the interests of their students. This causes uninteresting work that'll most likely not get done. However, if students were to design these projects, they'd have a whole lot more interest in the work. Students know what interests them, so it would make sense for the students to design a project that would be appealing to them.  Now, there are the claims that things won't go as intended or the students will slack off regardless of if they made the project or not. I don't see this being an issue. If the students make the project, they know exactly what to follow and how they plan to follow it. Students can easily conform the project guidelines to their interests and have more interest in the project.  All in all, student-made summer projects would be better. The students would be able to set up their guidelines and have the work easily manageable alongside the rest of their schedule. It'd also make for some really interesting results.		0
 The face on Mars is one of the most intriguing and mysterious features of the planet. Scientists and researchers have been studying the face for decades, trying to understand its origins and significance.  One theory about the face is that it is a volcanic formation. This theory is based on the fact that the face is located in a region of Mars known as the Tharsis bulge, which is believed to be the result of massive volcanic activity that occurred on the planet billions of years ago. The bulge is so large that it is visible from space and has been measured to be about 5 kilometers high and 4 kilometers wide.  Another theory is that the face is a result of meteor impacts. According to this theory, the face was formed by a series of massive meteor impacts that occurred on Mars in the past. The impact of these meteorites would have caused the surface of the planet to be blasted apart, forming the rugged and irregular features of the face.  Despite the many theories that have been proposed, the true origin of the face on Mars remains a mystery. Some scientists believe that it may be a combination of both volcanic activity and meteor impacts, while others believe that it is simply a natural feature of the planet that has been shaped by the forces of erosion and wind over time.  Regardless of its origins, the face on Mars continues to be a source of fascination for people all over the world. It has been the subject of countless scientific studies and explorations, and has even been featured in popular culture. The face has become a symbol of the mysteries and wonders of the universe, and its discovery has inspired generations of scientists and explorers to push the boundaries of our understanding of the cosmos.  In conclusion, the face on Mars is a remarkable feature of the planet that has captivated people's imaginations for decades. While its origins and significance remain a mystery, it continues to inspire curiosity and discovery in the scientific community and beyond. Future exploration of the face on Mars will no doubt reveal even more about this enigmatic and fascinating feature of our solar system.		1
Dear Mrs Principal,  I think that it is good idea to change the policy for students. I think that it is good because if you don't have a good grade then you shouldn't be able to play sports. Kids who don't have a good grade average means they don't do their homework. Homework is to be done at home and if they don't do their homework then they shouldn't go to practice or maybe stay after school to go to practice. The kids should make up their work and actually do homework rather then go to practice and other activities.  Another reason is that, if they stay back they should be kicked off the team because it isn't fair that the kids who do good and pass get to do another year.  Another reason is that, the kids who do good in school do their homework and still go to practice when other kids are lazy. Its not fair to other kids who do their homework. Maybe you should warn the kids about the policy so they could get their grades up before you actually change the policy so a lot of kids don't get kicked out of their sport. If they don't bring their grades up and get kicked out of their sport, if they bring their grades up maybe you can allow them to go back to their sport. If they keep the good grade then they can do sports but if they don't then you can kick them out of sports.		0
Highways, roads, streets; they are everywhere. No matter where you are or what part of town, these are always found nearby. Wherever roads are found, so are cars. People have been driving vehicles since the 1950's and over time, have had many positive effects on the world; but they have also had many negative effects. Luckily, the government has been helping to reduce car usage to save the world. Limiting car usage helps the world become a better place by decreasing pollution and keeping individuals active.  According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, cars make up "12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe" and can be responsible for "50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States," (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars). These percentages show how much humans rely on cars, which is negatively impacting countries. Greenhouse gases are extremely awful for the environment, and if they are not decreased significantly, then the Earth could become a bad place for existance. In many places, government officials have been trying to limit the percentage coming from cars, which has helped greatly. Rosenthal claimed in a different article, The End of Car Culture, that "As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was...equal to where the country was in January 1995." The drop of this percentage has decreased the amount of greenhouse gases in the world. Many events all over the world have contributed to the lower percentage. For example, the Car-Free Day in Bogota, Columbia has been a huge hit since the mid 1990's and is continuing to grow each year (Andrew Selsky, Car-Free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota). This activity along with others will continue to bring the percentage down until it is hopefully extremely small.  Fast food and the lack of exercise has increased the number of obese people greatly. With a lack of transportation, there is a bigger opportunity for individuals to eat healthier and exercise more. Andrew Selsky, a writer from the Seattle Times published an article about Bogota's Car-Free Day. He confirmed that "It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths," (Car-Free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota). The building of new sidewalks has increased the number of people using them each day. With more people walking and exercising, the rate of obesity should decrease dramatically. Not only is exercising important, but eating healthy is as well. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, cities in Germany are now stating, "stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway," (In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars). Since there can only be a limited number of shops in the city because they have to be close by, healthier options have been chosen more often, keeping people in shape. Not only do the individuals look healthier, but they feel better.  Saving the Earth and other people are two huge causes for limiting car usage. Keeping both alive and healthy can keep everyone happy and safe. Reducing car usage has great advantages and all humans should consider different methods of transportation; walking, bking, or even carpooling are great alternatives to help the world. It may not seem like it now, but the decision of limiting car usage can be a life or death situation.    		0
It would be an amazing experience to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it would be an opportunity of a lifetime. According to the text, Luke said, "Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water." The text also says that he toured a castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.  Also, if you worked on one of those boats, you would be helping people in need in other countries. The text states that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. And lastly, being a Seagoing Cowboy changed Luke's life. In conclusion, I think it would be a good decision to join the Seagoing Cowboys and go on a life-changing adventure.		0
Being assingned president of the united states is a very big deal, especially to the millions of people that live in this god blessed country.  herThe united states of america has had different presidents ever since the beginning of this country. These presidents are not in it for the money, but they are holding the title  "  president"  because these people want what is right for this country. But, how do we pick who gets to be president? It all comes down to the electoral college. Citizens of the united states are allowed to vote at the age of 18, these votes are said to mean so much, but that isnt always the case. It really all comes down to the number of electoral votes. Why make all these citizens vote, when the outcome might not even follow along with these votes.  There are two types of votes. The electoral college votes, and the popular votes which is the number of citizens who voted for one certain canidate. How ever there has been times where the popular vote did not win the election. In 2000, canidate Gore had more of the popular votes then Bush did, but Bush had the most electoral votes. Shouldn't the citizens of this country be the ones who get to determine who the President is? I mean the President has a big duty and the citizens rely on His/Hers duty as president to keep things going right. The President can make huge decisions that affect these citizens which can make things horribly wrong or amazingly right.  Yes, I know the people in the electoral college are super smart geniuses that know what they are doing, but? This is the country i live in, this is the country i was raised in, this is the country i love and am so blessed to be. I deserve to be able to pick the president i want, or at least have my vote be the reason the president i was rooting for wins. Us fellow citizens of the united states only want whats best for us. We may not be as smart as the people in the electoral college, but that sure wont stop us from knowing who we like and who we think is better for our country. We deserve as much right to have our own president as much as anyone in the elecotral college does.  This God blessed country is home to millions, it might not be perfect, but it is the greatest country in the world. The people who get the amazing benefit of living here deserve to be able to elect the President they want. These people want what they believe is best.                     		0
Ugh, I can't believe I have to write another essay. But here it goes.  So, I think that music, drama, and art classes should be electives and not required. I know some people might say that these classes are important for kids to develop their creativity and stuff, but I don't think so.  First of all, music classes are just a waste of time. I mean, who's gonna listen to our terrible singing and playing? It's not like we're gonna be rockstars or anything. And don't even get me started on drama. I mean, who wants to act like a bunch of weirdos on stage? It's just not my thing. And art? Forget about it. I can't even draw a straight line. It's just not worth it.  And it's not fair to everyone. Some kids might actually be good at these things and enjoy them, but most of us aren't. So why force us to take these classes and pretend to be something we're not? It's just not fair to the kids who are actually talented and could be doing something they love, but instead they're stuck in a class with a bunch of people who can't even carry a tune.  And it's not important either. I mean, how many times are we gonna be graded on our ability to play the recorder or paint a picture? It's not like these skills are gonna help us in real life. I'd rather learn something useful like math or science. At least then I could use it to get a good job and make some money.  So yeah, I think music, drama, and art classes should be electives. It's just not worth it.  Sincerely, An Average 8th Grader		1
I have been to tons of places around the world. I would want lots of people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. I got to visit Europe and China. Then we would go help others after wars. I would help by giving food supply and animals to people who needed them. You could do the same too.  However, we got to see the Acropolis in Greece. Our crew also got to go on a Gondola ride in Venice to Italy. Then we went to a castle in Crete and to Panama Conal. The crew would help animals that we would bring on the ship to send to other countries. We would spend the rest of our time playing fun games together.  When I got to help people I also got to see that part of the country. I have made nine trips. More than any of other Seagoing Cowboy. You could probably go on more trips. We had to have 335 horses and food to take to Greece. Before that, we had to report to New Orleans.  When I turned 18 I could've been drafted to military but when they learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip they didn't make me. I was already helping other people out there. We helped people by recovering their food supplies, animals, and more. So you should benefit others and join us. It would help us and other people out there.  If you enter the Seagoing Cowboys you could sight all the countries in the world. You would also get to help others that have been hurt, and raise animals to give to others. This is a great way of helping other people with out anything. You would also get to explore other parts of the world. This is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.		0
 The debate over the adoption of a curfew for teenagers continues to be a contentious issue among city councils. The proposed curfew would require teenagers to be home by 10 p. m. on weekdays and midnight on weekends, with those found on the streets after those hours being in violation of the law. While some argue that curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, others believe that they unfairly interfere in young people's lives.  Curfews can certainly have their benefits in keeping teenagers safe. For example, if they are out late at night, they may be at risk of getting kidnapped or being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Additionally, if a police officer stops or pulls them over, they may be asked questions about their whereabouts, which could potentially put them in trouble.  However, it is important to consider the potential negative consequences of a curfew. For instance, some parents may worry about their children's safety if they are not home. While it may be tempting to meet up with friends at night, it may not always be worth the risk. Additionally, curfews can be seen as a lack of trust in young people, which can have a negative impact on their self-esteem and relationships with their parents.  It is also important to consider the potential impact of a curfew on a teenager's social life. While it may be tempting to spend time with friends at night, it may be more beneficial to hang out during the day or have a sleepover. It is important for teenagers to have a healthy balance between their social lives and their responsibilities.  Ultimately, the decision to implement a curfew for teenagers should be made with careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks. While curfews can certainly have their benefits, it is important to ensure that they do not unfairly interfere with young people's lives. Instead, it may be more beneficial to focus on building trust and communication between parents and teenagers, as well as providing them with alternative activities and opportunities to socialize in a safe and responsible manner.		1

Card tricks have the power to amaze and entertain people of all ages.  Finally, one rare and impressive talent that can be shared with the world is the ability to speak multiple languages. This talent can be shared with others through various platforms, such as language lessons, language exchange programs, and online videos. Speaking multiple languages has the power to connect with people from different cultures and backgrounds.  In conclusion, talents and skills are unique abilities that set us apart from others. When you possess a talent, it's important to share it with the world. By doing so, you can showcase your abilities and impress others. Talents can be hidden within us, but they are meant to be shared with the world. So go out there and share your talent with the world!		1
 In today's digital age, schools have introduced a variety of tools and methods to facilitate the learning process for students. One such tool is distance learning, which allows students to complete all their schoolwork and academic requirements from the comfort of their own homes. However, is this approach truly beneficial for students? This essay will argue that distance learning has its limitations and that traditional classroom learning is more beneficial for students in terms of social development and preparation for adulthood.  Firstly, it is widely accepted that students learn important social skills in school, such as communication, conflict resolution, and teamwork. These skills are crucial for success in both personal and professional life. While distance learning allows students to interact with their peers and teachers through online platforms, it lacks the face-to-face interactions that are essential for social development. In a traditional classroom setting, students have the opportunity to engage in discussions, debates, and collaborative projects with their peers, which helps to build their confidence and interpersonal skills.  Secondly, distance learning may not provide the same level of preparation for adulthood as traditional classroom learning. School is not just about acquiring knowledge and skills, but also about preparing students for the real world. Traditional classroom learning provides students with a structured schedule, homework assignments, and interactions with teachers and peers that simulate the demands of the workplace. Distance learning, on the other hand, may be less structured and less challenging, which could hinder students' ability to adapt to the demands of the workforce.  Furthermore, distance learning may not provide the same level of accountability and motivation as traditional classroom learning. In a traditional classroom setting, students are expected to attend classes, complete assignments, and participate in class discussions. This structure provides students with a sense of responsibility and motivation to keep up with their studies. Distance learning, on the other hand, may be more flexible, which could lead to procrastination and a lack of motivation.  In conclusion, while distance learning may provide students with convenience and flexibility, it may not be as beneficial as traditional classroom learning in terms of social development and preparation for adulthood. Traditional classroom learning provides students with opportunities for face-to-face interactions, a structured schedule, and accountability, which are essential for success in both personal and professional life. Therefore, schools should continue to offer traditional classroom learning as a primary option for students,		1
The Seagoing Cowboys program was a life-changing experience for me. I got to see so many different places and have adventures that I never thought I would have. I'm not the only one who feels this way, lots of other cowboys have had similar experiences.  Firstly, the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to see the world. I got to visit places like Hawaii, Japan, and Korea. I even got to go to Russia! Can you believe it? Russia! I never thought I would be able to visit a place like that. And let me tell you, it was amazing. The culture, the food, the people, everything was so different from what I'm used to. It was a real eye-opener.  Secondly, the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to learn new skills. I learned how to ride horses, how to take care of them, and how to handle all sorts of situations. I even learned how to speak some Russian! It was really helpful when we were in port and I could talk to the locals. It made me feel like I was really connecting with them.  Thirdly, the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to make new friends. I met so many other cowboys who were just like me, passionate about horses and adventure. We became like a family, looking out for each other and supporting each other through the ups and downs.  Lastly, the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to challenge yourself. It's not always easy, there are long days and hard work, but it's worth it. You'll learn so much about yourself and what you're capable of. I never thought I could handle some of the things I had to do, but I did it. And you can too.  In conclusion, the Seagoing Cowboys program is an amazing opportunity. It's a chance to see the world, learn new skills, make new friends, and challenge yourself. I'm so glad I did it and I think you should too. So, saddle up and get ready for the adventure of a lifetime!		1
Dear principal  I have heard that you may be considering changing school polices that students may not participate in sports unless they have at least a grade B  average . But many off those students have at least a grade C average. I believe that students with at least a grade C average should be able too play in sports because a C average is not fail it is passing but it is passing on a lower level of passing but it still counts . I think that if the student is failing one or more classes then he or she should not participate in sports until he or she gets his or her grades up. I understand you may think that the students should have a grade B average because it is important too keep your grades up even if your playing a sport but i still highly recommend that you make it a grade C  average because it will allow more students too play the sport that they would like too play but the catch is that if they do not keep there average up they can not continue too play that sport that they choose they will just have to focus on grades so they can play that sport . I have stated my opinion on what i think you should do you may take the idea or leave it but if you took the time too read this i thank you for listening to me idea.		0
I believe that there are many advanteges of limiting car use, people should ride bikes more or walk to places that are near by instead of driving it helps clean the world of all the pollution in the air. Walking or riding a bike instead of driving to places that are close enough helps prevent the build up of smog, also you save money on gas. Second it helps lower pollution that is in the air and helps lower peoples stress, and last it helps to conserve energy, lower emmissions and improve saftey. If it is ever necesery to use a car, try car-pooling or get a taxi instead of driving yourself.  Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greehouse gas in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. If people who live near stores would use bikes and would walk to the store instead of driving it would help minimize the expansion of smog. After five days of the partial driving ban in Paris the capital of france congestion (traffic) went down 60 percent, the smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Also an advantage for limiting the use of cars is you save on the money you would spend on gas. you would be able to spend it on yourself or on important things like bills and groceries.  Second it helps lower pollution that is in the air and helps lower peoples stress levels. Peoples stress levels will come down due to the exercise they will be doing instead of driving, for exmaple in Bogota, Colombia parks and sports centers have bloomed through out their city, also not having to worry about if they they have enough money for gas will help the stress go down.  Last but not least a few other advanteges are it helps to conserve energy, lower emmissions and improve saftey. It conserves the fossil fuels that are running out fast due to many people driving. It also helps lower emmission from the cars that people drive aroud the United states and the world, which pollutes the air and then creates smog. And it helps improve safety by haing less car sccidents and people being run over by cars. It will help by making the death rate of accidents go down.  In conclusion I believe these reasons are why there are advantages to limiting car usage, walking or riding a bike instead of driving to places that are close enough helps prevent the build up of smog, also you save money on gas. Second it helps lower pollution that is in the air and helps lower peoples stress, and last it helps to conserve energy, lower emmissions and improve saftey.                 		0
In my opinion, I think that is a good program for students. This program have a good benefit for stdents and people that don't have time for go to school. For example, some students that coming form another country they don't have time for go to school to learn English or for go like normal student to the school. I agree that some schools have this good program for students.  My firts reason, I agree with this program because, some students they can lear thing standing in home. For example they learn English, spanish, and franch or another thinf like " How I can complete an application for work."  And all this the students can learn standing in home.  My second reason, I agree with this program because, the stundent that will get this program they can dicided the time for take this classes online. Also the students can decided the day that they want to take this classes. Another, is that no only students can take this program also this program help people that never go to the school before and now with this program this people have the opportunity to learn something.  Some people are disagree with me. Becuase they think that if the student don't go to the school. they don't go to find another opportunity to lear. Another, is that they think is that teh internet is not a good place for learn thing.  In coclusion, this program is a good opportunity for students and people that want to learn standing in home.        		0
Outdoor activities offer a unique opportunity to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Being able to enjoy fresh air and the natural beauty of the world that surrounds us can bring about a sense of joy and peace that is difficult to find elsewhere. For me, one of my favorite outdoor activities is climbing. I love the challenge of pushing myself to the top of a mountain, being surrounded by stunning views and feeling a sense of accomplishment when I reach the summit. It's a great way to stay active, stay in touch with nature, and get a break from the monotony of everyday life.		1
Hey, Mrs. Johnson!   So, I know you're probably thinking about how online classes could be a good thing for us K-12 students, and I'm here to tell you that it's not all rainbows and butterflies.   First of all, let's talk about the pros.  Okay, so taking online classes from home can be super convenient. Like, we can wear our pajamas and eat Cheetos while we learn.  And, we don't have to deal with the annoying kid in the back of the classroom who always talks too much.  That's gotta be a plus, right?  But, here's the thing.  Online classes can be really hard to focus in on.  Like, sometimes I'll be in the middle of a lesson and my cat will jump on my lap, or my sibling will come in and ask for help with their homework.  And, if I'm not careful, I'll get distracted and forget what I was even learning in the first place.   And, let's not forget about the social aspect of school.  I mean, sure, we can video chat with our friends during breaks, but it's not the same as being in the same room together.  We miss out on all the fun stuff, like group projects and school dances.   Another con is that online classes can be really isolating.  Like, sometimes I'll be stuck at home all day, staring at a screen, and I'll forget about the world outside of my bedroom.  It's like, I'm missing out on all the important stuff, like seeing my friends' faces and getting some fresh air.   So, there you have it, Mrs. Johnson.  I think online classes have their pros and cons, but I think it's important to weigh them carefully before making a decision.  What do		1
 The electoral college is an electoral system used in the United States to determine the president of the country. Under this system, citizens elect representatives who in turn elect the president. The system was put in place by the framers of the U.S. Constitution as a compromise between selection by Congress and selection by popular vote. However, in recent years, there has been much debate over whether the electoral college is still effective and whether it is time to abolish it.  One argument in favor of leaving the electoral college is that it allows for the smaller states to have an equal say in the election process. In other words, it ensures that the president is not just elected by large population centers and urban areas. Instead, the president must appeal to voters in all 50 states, giving equal weight to each vote. This system also allows for smaller states to have a more significant influence on the election than they would in a pure popular vote system.  Another argument in favor of the electoral college is that it encourages candidates to focus on all parts of the country, not just on large urban areas. In a pure popular vote system, candidates might win the election simply by winning in large cities and ignoring the rest of the country. By requiring candidates to appeal to voters in all 50 states, the electoral college forces them to consider the interests and needs of all Americans, not just those in urban areas.  However, there are also arguments against the electoral college. One of the most common is that it is outdated and that technology has made the system less effective. In the days before television and the internet, it was difficult for a candidate to campaign across all 50 states. But in today's world, candidates can use mass media and the internet to reach voters in all parts of the country. This technology has made it easier for candidates to campaign nationally and has diminished the importance of individual states in the election.  Another argument against the electoral college is that it can lead to a "winner takes all" mentality in politics, where candidates focus solely on winning states and ignore the needs of those who are not in their voting bloc. This can lead to a polarized political climate where only the most extreme views are represented.  In conclusion, the electoral college is a complex system that has been in place since the founding of the United States. While it has its advantages, such as ensuring that the president is elected by citizens across all parts of the country, it also has its disadvantages. The system can be outdated and can lead to a "winner takes all" mentality in politics. Ultimately, whether the electoral college works is up to the citizens of the United States and their willingness to continue to use the system to elect their president.		1
Limited car use has dramatically reduced the amount of enviromental toxins in the air in some cities. Paris, France and Bogota, Colombia have banned car use for a day and have seen the air clean up just because very few cars were being driven. One community in Germany even banned the use of cars in general. The enviroment is in dire need of help and we can help it. If everyone took one day out of the week where we did not drive anywhere and on the other six days we drove as little as possible and carpooled the air would be so much cleaner. Not driving also has added health benefits, walking or biking everywhere is a good way to excersise.  A new kind of suburb has been created in Germany where cars are not allowed. There are a few roads on the perimeter of the city that allow cars to be driven but besides that residents walk or bike everywhere. There is little pollution in the air and residents are able to take a tram into neighboring cities. Seventy percent of families do not have a car and fifty-seven percent of families sold their car to live in this community. If you own a car in this community you can buy a parking spot for forty thousand dollars. One resident, Heidrum Walter, said, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier that way." Lack of cars also gives parents peace of mind, cars are still dangerous machines and in this community their kids can play without their parents worrying about them getting involved in an accident.  Paris' pollution rates have been rising over the years and hit almost record level highs for a few days, so in order to reduce the amount of smog in the air there was a temporary car ban. One day anyone who has a even-number license plate was not allowed to drive. If you were caught driving you had to pay a fine that is equalivant to thirty-one U.S. dollars. The smog miraculosly cleared up quickly and people were able to drive again. Another city in Columbia, Bogota, holds a "Day Without Cars", once a year. Citizens are allowed to use public buses and taxis during this day. The government is trying to advocate for public transportation and smog reduction. Most people walk on this day and even though it has rained on this day before citizens participated just the same.  When you choose to walk or bike everywhere it not only makes an impact on the enviroment but it also reduces your risks for dieseases like obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Obesity rates in America are a lot higher than they should be and that's partially due to lack of physical activity. By walking or biking to work or to school you reduce that risk because your heart rate is up and your body is moving. Of course if people stop driving obesity will still exist due to our horrible eating habits but it would help a lot. If there was less driving it would also be beneficial to our health because we would be breathing cleaner air. The air we breathe is often times highly polluted and if there was less cars not as many deadly chemicals would be in the air. There would still be cigarette smoke and factory pollution but it would be dramatically less.  If people in America reduced their driving time it would be better for the air and better for us. Many other cities have proposed an annual day without cars so I think cities in America should start doing it. We only have one world and although we have done a pretty horrible job of taking care of it, that does not mean we can't attempt to fix the mess we made.    		0
In today's world, cell phones have become an essential part of our lives. They are not only used for communication but also for various other purposes like navigation, internet access, and entertainment. However, the use of cell phones while driving a vehicle has been a controversial issue. Some people believe that drivers should be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle, while others argue that it is a dangerous practice that should be banned. In my opinion, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.  First and foremost, using a cell phone while driving can be a major distraction for the driver. When a driver is talking on the phone or texting, their attention is diverted from the road, which can lead to accidents. According to a study, using a cell phone while driving increases the risk of a car crash by four times. Moreover, drivers who use cell phones while driving are more likely to miss traffic signals and road signs, which can result in serious accidents.  Secondly, using a cell phone while driving can also be a distraction for other drivers on the road. When drivers see someone using a cell phone while driving, they tend to get curious and try to see what the driver is doing. This can cause them to lose focus and increase the risk of an accident.  Lastly, the use of cell phones while driving is illegal in many states and countries. In the United States, many states have banned the use of hand-held cell phones while driving. Some states even have laws that prohibit the use of hands-free devices while driving. This shows that the use of cell phones while driving is considered a serious safety concern by lawmakers.  In conclusion, the use of cell phones while driving should be strictly prohibited. It is a dangerous practice that can lead to accidents and put the lives of the driver and others on the road at risk. Instead, drivers should focus on driving safely and avoid any distractions that can take their attention away from the road.		1
 Venus is the second planet from the sun and the closest planet to Earth. It is commonly known as Earth's "sister planet" due to their similarities in size, composition, and atmosphere. However, despite their similarities, Venus is considered a unique and fascinating world that presents its own set of mysteries and scientific challenges.  One of the main differences between Venus and Earth is the planet's atmosphere. While Earth has a relatively thin and breathable atmosphere composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere that is composed almost entirely of carbon dioxide, with clouds made of sulfuric acid. The pressure on Venus is also much greater than on Earth, which is another reason why it is so difficult to explore.  Despite these challenges, scientists have been making progress in exploring Venus. In recent years, there have been a number of successful missions to study the planet's surface and atmosphere. For example, the Magellan spacecraft, launched in 1990, completed a full mapping of Venus' surface, revealing a world that is covered in mountains, volcanoes, and vast oceans.  More recently, the Venus Express spacecraft, launched in 2005, has been studying the planet's atmosphere in detail. The spacecraft has measured the temperature and pressure at different altitudes, as well as the composition of the atmosphere. These measurements have provided scientists with a better understanding of the planet's conditions, which are thought to be similar to those on Earth during its early history.  Despite the challenges of exploring Venus, it is a world that continues to fascinate scientists and the public alike. Its unique atmosphere and conditions present a wealth of scientific opportunities, and the discovery of any signs of life on the planet would have major implications for our understanding of the universe. As our knowledge of Venus grows, so too does our appreciation for the diversity and complexity of the worlds that surround us.		1
 Dear Senator,  I am writing to express my view on the electoral college system and whether it is fair and effective in selecting the President of the United States. I strongly believe that the electoral college system should be kept in place, as it provides a fair and balanced representation of the American people and ensures that the President is elected by the entire country, not just a few swing states.  One of the main arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it ensures that every state has a say in the election, regardless of its population. This is important because it means that smaller states, which may have different concerns and priorities than larger states, are not overlooked in the election process. Additionally, the electoral college system provides a check and balance against a candidate who may be popular in certain regions but not nationwide. This ensures that the President is elected by the entire country, not just a few swing states.  Another argument in favor of the electoral college is that it encourages candidates to campaign across the country, not just in a few key swing states. When candidates know that they need to win votes in every state, they are more likely to focus on issues that are important to all Americans, rather than just those in a few key states. This ensures that the President is elected by the entire country, not just a few swing states.  However, some argue that the electoral college system is unfair because it can lead to a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election. This is true, but it is important to remember that the electoral college system is designed to balance the interests of the entire country, not just the popular vote. It is also worth noting that the electoral college system has only led to a candidate winning the popular vote but losing the election in five presidential elections since 1888, and only one of those elections was decided by a very small margin.  Overall, I believe that the electoral college system is a fair and effective way to elect the President of the United States. It provides a balanced representation of the American people and ensures that the President is elected by the entire country, not just a few swing states. Additionally, it encourages candidates to campaign across the country and focus on issues that are important to all Americans. I urge you to consider the benefits of the electoral college system and to support its continuation.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
Dear Principal,  I understand that you are debating between two policies about cell phones. One of which would make the students very happy. The other would be popular with teachers and staff. Each policy would be popular with one group, and unpopular with the other. Both policies have their pro's and con's.  Policy one would allow students to have their cell phones out between classes and during any free time they have. This would be very popular among students. They like to be able to text or call anyone and talk to them. This would make the school day more enjoyable for the pupils. On the other hand this could lead to a higher percentage of cheating. students could text their friend the answers to a test in a class the student just had. This would upset teachers because they have to focus more on cheating.  Policy two would not allow students to have their cell phones at school. This would focus students more on school work. there would be less distractions. This would also not raise the percentage of cheating. However pupils would not like this policy. They want the freedom to text or call their friends. This would make the school day less enjoyable for them.  Weighing the pro's and con's of each i decide to pick the second policy. Students don't need to text their friends in school. What kids need is a good education. They cant do that if they are texting their friend about what they are doing after school. It may not be popular with the students, but it is the smartest decision. What ever they need to say, they can wait until they seem them or are out of school. That is what I think, at least.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME   		0
The principal should let kids in school have at lease a B average because if it was lower then they should not participate in school sports until they get that grade up. Another reason is because they should let kids have that average is because is not bad, they should at lease be A' s and B' s. i also think that a c average is good because is no that low but they should at least put i t up. For example if someone wants to play in soccer and they have A' s and B' s and they have only one C they should tell him/her to put it up and then she could get in soccer. The principal should let us do activities in school is because not all the students are going to have at lease b average. Kids in our school should have fun that's what sports is about. Then for example let say all most all the kids participating in a sport and they have at lease a c average then they wont be able to participate in activities unless they put that grade up. Another reason is maybe is there last year and they want to participate maybe with their friends and they cant because they don't have they average they are supposed to have. Does it really matter what their average is. My last reason is they should let us participate in school activities and sports because maybe they didn't had a chance last year because of their grades and now they are trying to put it up this year or at least give them a chance and let them participate in school sports and activities. These are my reasons why the principal should let kids in our school participate in school activities and sports.		0
The Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that can identify human emotions. It's like a computer can read your face! In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author talks about how this technology works and how it can be used. I think it's really cool, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to use it in a classroom.  On the one hand, this technology could be super helpful for teachers. Imagine if your teacher could tell if you're confused or bored just by looking at your face! They could adjust their lesson plan to make sure everyone understands and is engaged. It could also help them spot if someone is feeling sad or anxious, and they could offer support. That's really important, because sometimes students might not want to talk about how they're feeling.  On the other hand, I think it's a little creepy that a computer can read my emotions. What if it's wrong? What if it thinks I'm bored when I'm actually just thinking deeply? What if it thinks I'm confused when I'm actually just daydreaming? It's also a little scary to think about all the data that would be collected. Who would have access to it? How would it be used?  I also worry that this technology could be used to punish students. Like, if a student is caught looking bored or distracted, they might get in trouble. That wouldn't be fair, because maybe they're just having a bad day or they're struggling with the material. It's important for teachers to understand that students are human beings, and we have good days and bad days.  I think it's important for schools to have policies in place to protect student privacy and data security. They should make sure that students and parents are aware of how the technology is being used and what data is being collected. And they should definitely get consent from students and parents before using this technology in the classroom.  In conclusion, while the Facial Action Coding System technology is really cool and could potentially be helpful in a classroom, I think it's important to think carefully about how it's used. We need to make sure that it's used in a way that respects student privacy and doesn't punish students for normal human emotions.		1
Community service is an essential method to help keep our cities clean and safe. It involves volunteering time and resources to help improve the quality of life for those living in our community. By participating in community service, we can make a significant impact on the environment and the safety of our city.  Firstly, community service is an excellent way to keep our cities clean. Volunteers can participate in activities such as picking up litter, planting trees, and cleaning up public spaces. These efforts help to reduce the amount of waste and debris that accumulates on our streets, making our cities more visually appealing and enjoyable to live in. Additionally, by keeping our cities clean, we can help to prevent the spread of disease and illness, which is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Secondly, community service is an effective way to promote safety in our cities. Volunteers can participate in activities such as neighborhood watch programs, which help to reduce crime and improve public safety. Additionally, community service projects such as building and maintaining community gardens and parks can help to create a sense of community and foster social connections, which can help to reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness.  Finally, community service is a great way to teach valuable skills and promote personal growth. By volunteering, we can learn new skills such as leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving. Additionally, by giving back to our community, we can develop a sense of pride and fulfillment, which can help to improve our mental health and well-being.  In conclusion, community service is an important method to help keep our cities clean and safe. By volunteering our time and resources, we can make a significant impact on the quality of life for those living in our community. Whether it's picking up litter, planting trees, or participating in a neighborhood watch program, community service is a rewarding and fulfilling way to give back to our community.		1
Have you ever heard the term majority rules? It means if more than half rule on one side, then that side will win. Many organizations and committees use majority rules because it means they are taking advice from multiple people and not just one. Taking opinions from multiple people may help someone with making a better choice. I believe it could give options to the wisdom-seeker, it could make them confident about one choice that they could go with, and it would mean they would have multiple arguments for a side.  When someone takes an opinion from multiple people, they have more choices/pieces of wisdom. If a person is writing an article and needs advice on what to write, they go to one person and only get one piece of advice to help them with their article. If they go to multiple people, they have options to weigh and decide what they want to write on. One example of this is Congress. Before any bill passes, they all take a vote. Whichever side is more than half will win, which is majority rules coming back into play. Congress does this to see what others have to say about the topic, not just what one person has to say. This is one of the reasons why taking more than one opinion can help someone make wise choices.  Last summer, I played on a travel basketball team that went to Maryland every weekend and played in a tournament. I was the point guard on the team, which meant that I was the captain on the court. I was calling plays, running pep talks, and keeping my teams head up. One Saturday, my dad and I drove up to the tournament and when I got there, all my teammates were excited. They started telling me about how easy our schedule was and how we could easily win this tournament. Our first game came and on the first play of the game, I twist my ankle. I sat the rest of the game out and my 2nd game as well. I told my dad that I would be fine to play in the championship but he told me that I couldn't. I asked my coach and he told me that I should not take the risk. I was mad that my coach and my dad said I shouldn't play, but we still ending up winning. The moral of the story was that I took my dad's and my coach's advice and decided not to play. Since I got the advice from 2 trusted adults that I knew, I understood that it was probably the smartest decision for me to make. Taking advice from multiple people can make someone more confident about their choice on the topic.  Getting multiple opinions on a topic such as a debate article may not always mean he/she is right, but it means that they have multiple people's arguments on the topic. For example, if I asked around about child soldiers and I had multiple people tell me that they shouldn't be given amnesty, I could use their arguments to my side even if they should be given amnesty. If someone takes advice from different people and they all tell you along the same lines of the same piece of advice, they could use it even if it's wrong, because they have people standing behind them with the same argument and same reasons.  Taking advice from multiple people is more helpful than taking it from 1 person because it helps give options to someone who might need it for a test or a scenario in their life. It is also helpful when someone knows the advice they need but they want to check with others to see if they're thinking the same way about the scenario. The last reason of why it is important is because even if someone takes advice from many others and the advice is wrong, he/she has their arguments to help you out. This information is very important at the moment because right now the world is tasked with something they could use a lot of advice on. The Coronavirus is a disease that has 115,000 cases all around the world and the U.S. has 574 cases. The world has not found a cure yet and I believe that scientists are trying to find the cure themselves so they can get all the credit. If all the scientists in the world worked together and used each others advice and equipment, we could find a cure very easily and quickly. This is an example of using multiple people's advice because there could be 2 scientists who are very close to finding the cure and if they work together they could easily find the cure.       		0
I believe that driveless car are not good at all because we will have nothing to work for. But at the same time there are postitive effects and negative ones as well . Driverless car would make a huge change in our world today. There would be alot less bad things happening if they were driverless. People wouldnt have to go through the trouble to push the gas to make the care go or anything.  The postitive effects of turing to driveless cars are very high. People want this to happen so they are going to try to find all the positive thing about it and let other people know. The cars that Sergey Brin are creating would use half of the fuek that todays taxes and offer more flexibility than a bus. The cars have been driven more than half a million miles without crashing but the thing about that is that google care arent truly driverless. The cars still alret the driver when they are pullin gin and out of driveways or dealing with traffic suchas getting aroung roadwork and accidents.  The good thing right now is the cars are not completely driveless becuase you can steer, accelerate, and brake themseleves, but they are still designed to tell the driver that the road ahead requires them to something like get through work zones and around accidents.  There are many negitive thing to having driveless cars as well such as making sure that the automatic will happen at all times. What if what its suppose to do doesnt work out and then you do something else and you hurt someone or yourself.  The person would have to stay alert at all times just is case it doesnt do what its suppose to do. Even though its a drive less car you still have to keep your hands on the wheel at all times so you could not do anything that you wanted to do. They said that you had to take over when the car gets into situations and i dont think that is fair becuase its suppsose to be all driverless.  Some thing make me think that driveless cars are good but I don't agree at all. I feel like you have to put in just as much work as you do now to dirve the "driveless" car. You shoudn't have to keep your eyes are the road at all times because its suppose to do what it is suppose to do when its happening. The article said that it will cause less wrecks and i disagree becuase if people are doing what the are suppose to be doing you can get in a wreck so easily. I think that we should be able to control it whenever it is needed. If people dont want to us the "driverless" car they should be able to have an opition to turn it off and on.       		0
In today's increasingly competitive job market, it is important for students to commit to a career path at a young age. One way to do this is to take advantage of the resources offered by schools, like the help of teachers and access to career counselors. By starting to research and think about a career path early on in life, students can save themselves money and time in the long run. Furthermore, commitment to a career can help create a sense of independence, allowing students to make crucial decisions for their own future.   However, sometimes family, external pressures, or even fear of failure can impede a student from pursuing their dreams. It is important for students to remember that their career path should not be dictated by anyone else, and that personal ambition is a virtue. Even if the odds may be stacked against them, students should find the courage to follow their passions and use the resources available to them to turn their dreams into reality.		1
 Introduction:  Exploring Venus has been an ongoing challenge for scientists due to its harsh conditions and dangerous atmosphere. Despite these challenges, many researchers believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author presents several arguments to support this idea.  Body:  The author's first argument is that Venus is a unique planet, unlike other planets in the solar system. It has a similar size and gravity to Earth, making it a possible target for space exploration. Furthermore, Venus has a thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it incredibly hot and potentially habitable to life. The author's use of these details suggests that studying Venus has the potential to reveal important information about life and planetary environments in our solar system.  The author's second argument is that studying Venus can help us learn how to protect Earth from climate change. Venus has gone through extreme greenhouse warming, resulting in temperatures that can reach up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit. The author suggests that studying how Venus's atmosphere works could help us understanding how to prevent Earth's climate from becoming uninhabitable. This argument supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it has practical applications that can benefit humanity.  The author's third argument is that studying Venus is a matter of curiosity and scientific inquiry. The author suggests that the challenges faced while exploring Venus are what make the endeavor exciting and worthwhile. The idea of taking on these challenges and discovering new things about Venus and the universe motivates scientists to continue their research. This argument supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it meets the fundamental human desire for knowledge and understanding.  Conclusion:  In conclusion, the author effectively argues that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the challenges it presents. The author's use of details about Venus's unique characteristics, the practical applications of studying Venus, and the inherent curiosity of scientific exploration all support this idea. The author's well-supported arguments suggest that Venus is a worthy target for space exploration and that studying it has the potential to reveal important information about the universe. By continuing to explore Venus, scientists can further our understanding of the universe and potentially discover something that could benefit humanity.		1
 Students can benefit from taking online classes instead of attending school in person for several reasons. First, students can work at their own pace, which allows them to avoid the stress of waking up early and being tired throughout the day. Additionally, online classes can be completed at any time, without the need to worry about missing a deadline. This is particularly useful for students who may be sick or unable to attend school due to other commitments.  Another advantage of online classes is that they can be taken from the comfort of home. This eliminates the need for students to move around a lot, which can be tiring and distracting. Furthermore, students can focus more on their studies without the distractions of socializing with their peers.  Online classes also offer greater flexibility for students who may not be able to attend school regularly. For example, students who work part-time or have other responsibilities can take online classes and complete their coursework at their own pace. This can lead to better grades and a more balanced lifestyle.  In addition, online classes can help students develop important computer skills that will be useful in the future. They can also provide access to a wider range of resources and information that may not be available in traditional classroom settings.  Finally, online classes can be a great way for students to show their parents or guardians that they are taking their studies seriously. This can lead to greater support and encouragement, which can be beneficial for students in many ways.  Overall, online classes offer a number of benefits for students, including greater flexibility, improved focus, and the ability to work at their own pace. With the rise of technology, online classes are becoming increasingly popular and are likely to become even more prevalent in the future.		1
Luke's life changed after highschool, like anything is possible after you graduate. Luke may be just a small town farmboy, but his future is pretty bright. Luke worked two part-time jobs, so you can tell that he is hard working. Then his friend Don Reist gave him the opportunity of a life-time. To be a Seagoing Cowboy.  The Seagoing Cowboy program is where people go around the world on a boat to help people and animals. After World WarII, it was a great opportunity to go and help people and animals from other continents recover from this catastrophe. Reasons to become a seagoing Cowboy is, you get to help people and animals in need of assistance. Helping people is a good thing to do and it makes you feel good and the people you help feel good too. You also get to explore all of the exotic, unique places around the world when you are traveling. Those reasons are few of many.  "Seagoing Cowboys, to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up." paragraph 2. Luke and Don felt a need to help and put their time and effort to help these people and animals.  Even though Luke and Don care for people and love animals, some people wouldn't take the opportunity. Most people love animals and helping people, but some just don't like animals or they are too selfish to tak some time to go around the world and help other people with things that you already have and they don't. Or people get seasick or are just too paranoid to go on a boat because they think it is going to sink.  Besides, the portion that has most people who would do something like Luke and Don, are people around us and we will always have those kind of people.  To Luke, his life changed after this wonderful experience. His adventures opened up the world for him. "But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more that an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. "I'm grateful for the opportunity" he says. "It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs." And that awresess stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years."  paragraph 9.  That is what something like that can do to you. Something great, like this opportunity, could open your eyes to see that you just helped someone in great need and that makes you feel amazing. 		0
Venus is an interesting planet for various reasons.  Scientists believe that Venus is alike to earth. It has about the same density and size compared to earth. In the article it states in paragraph 4 that "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported varius forms of life, just like Earth." This quote helps state that it is a interesting planet and alike Earth they want to study and learn about it knowing the conditons.  Another example of how Venus is an interesting planet is because of the atmosphere and the ground conditions it has. Astronomers believe humans could survive there, however it wouldn't be easy with the conditions it has. A beam of light can barely pass throught the atmosphere; this causes the standard cameras to be ineffective.  In conclusion, Venus is a very interesting planet and despite the dangers it has, it is worth it to study. It will be harder to study knowing that you can't take anything from the planet back, or the fact that in order to do anything you need to actually be there on the planet to get a better understanding. 		0
Over the summer, students forget a lot of what they learned during the previous year; some even have trouble writing after summer break. This is why some schools have projects over the summer, such as summer reading. These projects should be designed by teachers because the teachers know how to incorporate important aspects of the course that they are teaching into a project, and because the students don't know the material in the course as well as the teachers do.  Teachers know how to introduce their students to new material, or prepare them to be introduced to new material; they are professionals at it. Many teachers have years of experience, or at the very least, they can go to another teacher in their department for help creating an idea for a project. Therefore, they should be able to curate a project that allows their upcoming students to be prepared for their class. While they may not be teaching new material with these projects, they are preparing their students for the rest of the year.  Some may argue that students should create ideas for projects for their fellow students because they themselves are students, and know what would have helped them. However, their teachers know the material better, and have a better understanding of what they can do to ensure the success of their students. Many students don't even remember what they learned at the beginning of the year. If they don't remember what they learned at the beginning of the school year, they can't come up with ideas for a project to introduce them to that material. Students don't want to do homework during the summer. If they were tasked with coming up with a project that introduces upcoming students to the material, they may just create a project that is easy but does not introduce the material well, in order to have less work to do over the summer.  Teachers should design summer projects for their students, because they know what they are teaching and how to incorporate the meaningful ideas from their class into a project, and because they know their curriculum better than their students do. Teachers are the ones ensuring that their students are prepared and know the material, and it is their responsibility to prepare their students for their curriculum. At the end of the day, the students are not the ones getting paid to teach their students.		0
Driverless cars would truly be an immense change in the daily lives of every driver in the world. A future where getting a license is no longer heard of and taking driving tests would just be a part of history would be the effect of these cars. Imagine how current parents and grandparents say how they grew up without televisions or cell phones, later on they will be saying how they had to drive their own car, and it will be mind blowing to everyone's future children.  My personal opionion on driverless cars is against them. I don't see how it is necessary for all cars to be re-done and have so much work put in to the idea of driverless cars, when we could just simply drive them ourselves. I don't see the importance of it. I believe to have a license and be capable of driving is a grand achievement. Every child looks forward to the day they can pass, first their permit test, and then later on, their driver's test. What happens when the driverless car stops working and is only able to drive with an actual driver? The skill of driving is very important, and it would be a shame to see that skill no longer necessary to learn in the future.  I can think of many more downfalls to the driverless car than positives. Not to mention, the amount of problems that can come about with these vehicles. If the car suddenly goes out of control or the car has to pull in a driveway? The driver will need to take over. I don't see a high possibility of these cars becoming available considering the innumerable amount of mishaps that happen when driving.  The article mentioned that automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved, but how can they be positive? Things can easily go wrong with this make, and to me, the effect isn't worth the risk. Car crashes are very harmful things mentally and physically to a human being and who's to say driverless cars will stop them?  In conclusion, i can't picture driverless cars being the official cars of the future. In order for them to have their full use, everyone would have to have a driverless car. Expenses, weariness of the model, and people who aren't willing to give their driving ability up wil be the ones to put a stop to driverless cars. I think some may own a driverless car, but there will never be a time when driverless cars are the only cars being used.   		0
The things you can do to help yourself, and others is just don't drive ride a bike, or take public transportation. Never the less having a car is a great responsiblitiy, like driving the right way, and not driving reckless. That could end up bad, because you know how law enforcement is they will pull you over for anything. Then on top of that they will give you a big fat nasty ticket to pay, so that really ruins what you have to like pay your bills or something. Plus its always better to just take public transportation, because trying to get a car that's worth $40,000, isn't even worth it, if your still paying for it, then you will have to take really good care of that car.  The car is at its lowest did you know that, because nobody buys them anymore, or nobody gets there permit. Cars are becoming nothing anymore, the roads America bulit will be soon for nothing. Like I said your better not buying a car, then spending all that money, and you have to spend more money on it later, Like if you get a ticket, or you have to pay to get it fix. Pointless absolutly pointless cause most people just uses cars to get from A to B, nothing else like what's the point of having a car if your not going to use it all the time might as well just take a bus, and spend like 50 cents, or something.  If you really want a car, at least use it instead of just showing it off, and letting it dust in your driveway, or garage. People in other countries like say Germany, all they use is bikes. They live a life without cars, and look at them saving all that money, and what if it is a poor country at least there not greedy and selfish. Also the cars are literally a poison to the enviorment, we are literally killing off our enviorment, and for what the nicest car that you have and probably won't even use that's pretty dumb as if i should say. Having a car, and showing it off doesn't make you cool it make's you look like a selfish greedy person who could have nothing else to spend his, or her money on but who am I to judge right? Soon you will realize that all that money you spent was all just a waste, and you could have done somethimg else better to spend it on.  I'm not saying don't buy a car, Like I mean don't buy the most expensive car ever cause like that's just herendous. Like just buy something that's nice and cheap like maybe a Nissian not a Ferrari. Imagine if you run out of money what are you going to do ask people to help, Your going to have that fancy car, and be like "oh what will i do". You will realize that you messed, and that when you were being all selfish and greedy, nobody will care to help you. It's like all these other regular people who use there money wisley and not be selfish. The car is nearly at it's end cause soon there will be no more gas, what will you do. It's at the time where you make your own desisions, and think about do I really want to spend my money on a car, or do I want to be smart and ride the bus, or a bike and save my money and help the enviorment.                    		0
Dear principal, as a student, I believe that the use of cell phones should be allowed at school, but only during lunch, and students free time and only then. Cell-phones should be allowed during class period only on every day that does not end with the letter 'Y'.  'The reason being?' someone may ask, and the answer would be as follows; 'The reason being that all class periods are meant for the learning of information, not an overload of texting or making of calls, but for learning the real skills in life that students will soon need in the upcoming future.' The main reason why cell-phones should be allowed during a students own free time would vary from help the helping of homework, to calling a family member because the student may have forgotten to bring a project to school.  That is why I believe that cell-phones usage should be allowed at school, during a students own free time, but during the class period only when Hell freezes over and no sooner.  Thank you, STUDENT_NAME		0
Making a good first impression is crucial in many aspects of life, including personal relationships, job interviews, and even everyday interactions. It is the initial perception that people have of you, and it can greatly influence the way they interact with you in the future.  One of the main reasons why making a good first impression is important is because people cannot go back in time. Once a first impression is made, it cannot be undone. This means that if you make a negative first impression, it can be difficult to change people's perceptions of you. For example, if you are interviewing for a job and you come across as unprofessional or disinterested, the interviewer may not see you as a good fit for the position, even if you have the qualifications and experience.  Another reason why making a good first impression is important is because it can lead to lost opportunities. If people have a negative perception of you, they may not be as likely to give you opportunities in the future. For example, if you are in a social setting and you come across as rude or insincere, people may not want to interact with you again, which can limit your social circle and opportunities for making new friends.  Finally, making a bad first impression can also lead to trouble. If people perceive you as untrustworthy or unreliable, they may be less likely to give you their time or resources. For example, if you are in a job and you consistently miss deadlines or fail to follow through on commitments, your boss may start to lose faith in you, which can lead to disciplinary action or even termination.  In conclusion, making a good first impression is crucial in many aspects of life. It can greatly influence the way people interact with you in the future, and it can lead to lost opportunities and even trouble if not done correctly. It is important to be aware of the way you present yourself and to make a conscious effort to make a positive first impression, whether it's in a job interview, a social setting, or any other situation.		1
Influence is a crucial aspect of life, and there are various ways to influence someone without using technology. While technology can be an effective tool for influencing, it is not the only way. In this essay, I will analyze the impact of examples versus other ways of influencing and provide examples to support my stance.  One way to influence someone is through personal communication. Personal communication involves face-to-face interactions or phone calls, and it allows for a more personal and direct approach to influencing someone. For example, a parent may use personal communication to influence their child to eat healthy foods or complete homework assignments. Personal communication allows for immediate feedback and the ability to adjust the message as needed. Additionally, personal communication can establish a stronger bond between the influencer and the person being influenced.  Another way to influence someone is through written communication. Written communication includes emails, text messages, and letters, and it allows for a more formal and structured approach to influencing someone. For example, a teacher may use written communication to influence their students to complete assignments on time or to behave appropriately in class. Written communication can also be more effective in reaching a wider audience, as it allows for the message to be shared with a larger group of people.  While examples can be useful in influencing someone, they are not the only way. Examples can be used to illustrate a point or to provide context, but they should not be the sole focus of the influence. For example, a parent may use examples of healthy foods to influence their child to eat better, but they should also provide information on the benefits of eating healthy foods and encourage their child to try new, healthy foods. Examples should be used in conjunction with other methods of influencing, rather than being the sole focus.  In conclusion, there are various ways to influence someone without using technology. Personal communication and written communication are two effective methods that can establish a stronger bond between the influencer and the person being influenced. While examples can be useful, they should not be the sole focus of the influence. It is important to use a variety of methods to effectively influence someone and to tailor the message to the individual.		1
Dear Principal :  I writing to you because of the way we do community service. I think every one needs to do community service it will help our town ,and our school if some one wants to help make a different. They can by helping kids they can help their grade improve and move up their grades. If they wanted to help around the school to make it better then they can do it. Just by cleaning and recycling can ,and plastic bottles we don't need. It can make a very big different at SCHOOL_NAME. More people can help us the best of their abilities. Just think of it if we can let this happen our school ,and whole town can look great and be better at what it does. It would be a honor to do any thing for the town of Winfield . Or the state of Alabama.  I hope we can make a very big change not just in our town ,but maybe even our country .So think you for your time and concern. Its not just it. Will start to help all the other towns in America or Alabama to make a change. Hope we can get that far. In what we are trying to accomplish .  Thanks, STUDENT_NAME   		0
Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Many people also drive a vehicle. When these two things are combined, they can be very hazardous to someone's life. Here are some reasons why you should not use a cell phone and operate a vehicle.  The main reason why you shouldn't use a phone while driving is because it is a distraction. The National Safety Council says that using a cell phone while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. People are often hit or run over by a car only because the drive was looking at their phone. So many accidents are caused by cell phone use, because when you are looking at the phone; you are not looking at the road.  There are numerous ways to prevent car accidents caused by cell phone use. Children need to be taught the dangers of using a phone and driving. In Georgia we have a law that says, "You have to have your phone in a cell phone holder while driving," if more states would do this we would be golden. And finally, you can use a Bluetooth earpiece, so you don't have to pick up or look at your phone to answer it. We know how to stop so why don't we stop it already.  When it comes down to it, using a cell phone while driving is one of the most dangerous things someone can do. When you're doing something as difficult as driving a car, the last thing you need is something to distract you. Preventing it is the best thing we can do right now. My grandma always tells me, "When it comes to a cell phone, just remember that no matter what it is, it can wait."   		0
Over the summer, schools believe that handing out summer projects is beneficial to a student's learning. This is because over the summer, students tend to forget what they have learned that year. Thus, when they return from their vacation, they struggle to comprehend the material. Many students dread the idea of having summer projects since it can take up a lot of time on someone's hands. When someone thinks of summer, they think of fun and freedom from the prison they call "school". Summer projects are highly recommended though, because they help the student's brain maintain the information they learned. These projects should be student based, because students would be more likely to do the project and it lets their creativity shine through.  An issue that many students see is that projects over the summer tend to be banal. This causes them to give up right away and not complete it. For example, I was given a project over the summer for English. It was very uninteresting because there was just an essay to do. Since this project was bland, I did not feel like doing it. It was dreadful to sit at a computer and write a long essay. There was nothing engaging about the assignment that could make a me inspired to write. The assignment ended up being useless, because it did not help me retain any information and it did not help me be prepared for the upcoming school year. Helping design the projects can help that student become better in school since the project that they would be designing would be beneficial to them.  Using creativity is one of the most important things for growth as a student. The left part of the brain is where all the creativity is stored. I have noticed how in schools there are not many classes or activities that let that side of the brain function. A good way for it to work is to let the projects be the outlet of all that thinking process. As an example, in my communications class, we always make videos and learn how to edit. My teacher one day let us do a video project. This meant that it could be about whatever our hearts wanted. Our videos could be a documentary, a music video, a scary movie, etc. We got to run our own projects. I chose to do a documentary about a singer in our school. This project let my ideas flow onto what I was making. I enjoyed to do the project because I was doing what I had envisioned. The difference between the teacher based project and the student based project is that it gave us the freedom to think outside the box. That odyssey of doing a project that us students designed was an experience that helped apply our knowledge.  Teacher designed projects though, do have its benefits as well. They are designed to help every student. When teachers come up with these projects they make sure that every detail can somehow help them prepare for the upcoming year. That way, when the students come back in the fall, they would have already had a preview of the material and won't be so behind. These assignments usually flow into different assignments. For example, an English essay can flow into a Socratic seminar. An issue that could come up with student designed learning is that, the students may design a project that does not require much effort or learning. This could become a grave issue when it is time to come back for classes. Hence, the teachers must give a project that will make the students learn.  Student designed projects is an idea that should be considered. The amount of students that would do the projects would increase. This would make the students more engaged in what they are doing and will make them learn something from it. The projects would be designed for them and they would not have trouble completing it. These summer projects do not have to seem dreadful, they can be percieved as a fun learning experience. The education system should put in place a choice for schools to let students design their own assignments over the summer. Student designed summer projects should be permitted because students would do the projects, and it would let their creativity shine.		0
Students go through a stressful school year with plenty of assignments, projects, and homework. Therefore when summer comes around summer projects should be student-designed because students would still be able to enjoy their summer with a project of their choosing, students will be able to display their creativity in their project, and students will finally be able to design their project after a school year of teacher-designed projects.  Summer projects should be student-designed because students would still be able to enjoy their summer with a project of their choosing. Students could enjoy their summer with this project because they are doing something they're passionate about. This will benefit students because they tend to put more effort into something they want to do. Also for students doing something they want to do, they strive to succeed and they'll choose something that they're comfortable with. In addition students could still enjoy their summer because of the stress it takes off of the student for them not having to go out of their comfort zone to complete another project subject that they have no clue about. The stress taken off students for the summer is beneficial because it gives them an energetic start to the next school year.  In addition summer projects should be student-designed because students will be able to display their creativity in their project. A student-designed project allows a student to show their creativity because they're making it their own. For example a teacher-designed project could be about the ocean and each students work will be very similar because they're all talking about the ocean, but with a student-designed project it will display the difference between each student within the school. Also students being able to express their creativity allows each student to be their own. This benefits the school and the students in it for it could create bonds between students that share the same likes and dislikes, let the teacher and adults get to know more about the students, and helps shape the diversity within the school.  Finally summer projects should be student-designed because students will finally be able to design their project after a school year of teacher-designed projects. This would be enjoyable for students because they get tired of completing assignments and projects that have nothing to do with their life or what they like. So for once a student-designed project would allow the student to finally do what they've wanted to do. In addition it will limit the amount of research and the extra work that goes into doing something that you're not familiar with, which leads to peaceful learning and a peaceful summer. With limited extra work and limited research it may make one think that they're not really learning, but they are and it teaches students a different skill when they're designing the project.  In conclusion it would be beneficial to both students and teachers if summer projects were student-designed because it will remain that students still have an exciting summer while being creative and finally being able to do a student-designed project. So therefore during the summer the only projects that are given should be student-designed so that it will remain intact for students to have a stress free summer for while they're still completing academic activity.                      		0
 I remember one summer vacation, that my family and I took, where we went to another state to visit another relative that we haven't seen in awhile. Summer vacation has been a time for teenagers to take a break from school to enjoy what they like to do during their free time. By having a long summer vacation, does not affect students to retain information from the past. teens should know that summer vacation is a time for them to relax and have fun.  First reason, why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to relax, is because they can spend time with their family. For example, the whole family can went to another state to visit another relatives that they have not seen in awhile. By spending more time with their family; consequently, teens can be more closer to their family. Teens can also, enjoy their summer vacation with their family by playing video games, watching movies, and go on a road trip.  another reason, why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to relax, is that they can hangout with friends. teenagers hangs out with friends to go to a party, or to watch a movie. by hanging out with friends teens can do what they think is fun for them and their friends. For example, teens can have a fun time playing pool with their friends or just by going to a gym. In addition, teens can also have fun with their friends by having a sleep over or go for a camping trip.  Lastly, on why students should know that summer vacation, is for them to relax, is that they are away from school, by being away from school students can have more time to have fun and do the things that are important to them. For example, students can stay up late and does not have to wake up early in the morning. However, teens can have more time in their hands, instead of having to learn.  In conclusion, these are the three most important opinions, on why teens should know that their summer is for them to relax, by having more time for summer vacation, teens can enjoy more time with their family and friends.		1
Hey there! So, I guess you're here to read my essay about why it's cool to ask more than one person for opinions and advice. Like, duh, right? I mean, who doesn't love getting multiple perspectives on stuff? It's like, way better than just asking one person and being like, "Okay, cool, thanks for nothing!"  First off, let's talk about why asking more than one person is awesome. I mean, think about it. If you ask one person, they might give you one opinion, but if you ask five people, you're gonna get like, five different opinions. And some of them might be totally different from each other! It's like, whoa, right? It's like getting a whole bunch of different viewpoints all at once. It's like, so cool!  And it's not just about getting different opinions, either. When you ask more than one person, you can also get different levels of expertise. Like, if you ask your super smart teacher about something, they might give you a really good answer, but if you ask your super cool older brother, they might give you a totally different perspective. It's like, they might have different areas of expertise or something.  But, like, there are also some risks to asking more than one person. Like, sometimes people might give you conflicting advice, and you're like, "Uh, what do I do now?" Or, they might not be super reliable, and you're like, "Ugh, thanks for nothing!" But, like, if you ask enough people, you can kinda figure out what's what.  Okay, so here's an example of a time when I asked more than one person for help. Like, last year, my family and I were going on a trip to the beach, and we were trying to decide where to stay. My mom wanted to stay at this fancy resort, but my dad wanted to stay at a campground. And I was like, "Ugh, I don't know what to do!" So, I asked my sister and my friend, and they both gave me different opinions. My sister was like, "You have to stay at the resort, it's so much fun!" But my friend		1
 In recent years, the idea of car-free cities has gained popularity, with more cities around the world considering implementing measures to reduce car usage. While some may argue that cars are essential for mobility and economic growth, there are many advantages to having a car-free environment.  One of the main advantages of a car-free city is increased public health. Cars are one of the biggest sources of air pollution, which can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues. By removing cars from the streets, cities can reduce their carbon footprint and create cleaner air for their inhabitants. Additionally, car-free cities are often designed with more walkable infrastructure, allowing people to be more active and engaging in physical activity. This can lead to a healthier population, with lower rates of obesity and other health problems.  Another advantage of a car-free city is improved traffic flow. Cars can be a source of congestion, with traffic jams and long wait times leading to increased travel times and decreased productivity. By reducing the number of cars on the road, car-free cities can reduce congestion and create smoother traffic flow. This can lead to reduced travel times, improved productivity, and a more efficient transportation system.  Car-free cities can also have a positive impact on the environment. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. By reducing car usage, car-free cities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and help to mitigate the effects of global warming. Additionally, car-free cities can reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and promote the use of sustainable transportation options.  Car-free cities can also have a positive impact on the economy. While some may argue that cars are essential for economic growth, there are many industries that can thrive without them. For example, cycling infrastructure can create new jobs in bike shops and repair centers. Additionally, car-free cities can attract new businesses and industries that prioritize sustainable transportation and living.  In conclusion, there are many advantages to having a car-free city. Car-free cities can improve public health, reduce congestion, protect the environment, and promote sustainable living. While the idea of a car-free future may seem daunting, there are many cities around the world that have successfully implemented car-free measures and seen the positive impact for themselves. It is time for other cities to follow their lead and embrace a car-free future.		1
"The Challenges of Exploring Venus" is an artical about how Venus is a close neighbor yet incredibly hard to study up close. The author suggest that is is worth the risk needed to study Venus and he had some compeling arguments. after reading this ask yourself would you take the risk?  Venus is a very extrem environment, with temetures that can melt tin. it is so extream that no space craft had survied more than a few hours on the surface of Venus. The planet had an atmospher of mostly carbon deoxide and is rittles with cloudes of sulfur. Despite all of that the author still belivews we should continue to explore Venus.  on of the authors key pointts was "...once have been the most earth-like planet inour solar system." The auter went on to say "Venus was probably coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth."  I belive this is a great reason to explore Venus more deeply, because if it has any truth to it why is the planet so deadly now? we should lookinto its past and make an understanding of what happend to Venus so we know what could happen to us and possibly even try and prevent it.  The author concluded thier artical by saying "striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also,because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." i belive this is the authors main point, not just that we should know more about the planet but that it keeps us sharp and provieds problems to slove. The human mind is curious and will alway want to "know how it works" or "whys it do that" and if we dont presue those questions then we are learning nothing.  So in conclusion althoghVenus is an extream environment we should explore it more deeply. We should try to find ways to do so. the author gave many points but his best one was simply that the peopel are curious and want to know so show us.      		0
I think that schools should not allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. I know that some people might say it's a good idea because it helps parents stay involved in their kids' education, but I think it's not a good idea for a few reasons.  First, it's important for kids to have some privacy. If parents can see everything their kids are doing in school, it might make them feel like they're always being watched, and that can be really stressful. Kids need to have some space to learn and grow on their own, without their parents always looking over their shoulders.  Another reason I think this practice is not a good idea is that it can create too much pressure on kids. If parents are always checking their grades and attendance, it can make kids feel like they have to be perfect all the time. This can lead to stress and anxiety, which can be bad for their mental health. It's important for kids to make mistakes and learn from them, and if their parents are always watching, it can be hard for them to do that.  Additionally, I think it's important for kids to learn how to take responsibility for their own education. If parents are always monitoring their grades and attendance, it can make kids feel like they don't have to take responsibility for their own learning. It's important for kids to learn how to manage their own time, and how to stay organized and motivated. If their parents are always doing it for them, it can make it harder for them to develop these skills.  Finally, I think it's important to trust teachers and the education system. Teachers are trained professionals who know how to help kids learn and grow. If parents are always monitoring their kids' grades and attendance, it can undermine the authority of teachers and make it harder for them to do their jobs. It's important to trust that teachers know what they're doing, and that they're doing their best to help kids succeed.  In conclusion, while some people might think that monitoring kids' grades and attendance online is a good idea, I think it's not a good practice. It can create too much pressure, undermine the authority of teachers, and make it harder for kids to learn how to take responsibility for their own education. Instead, we should trust teachers and the education system, and give kids the space they need to learn and grow on their own.		1

You should consiter being a seagoing coyboy.        		0
Introduction  In recent years, the use of online classes and video conferencing has become increasingly popular among students. While some may argue that these methods of instruction are less effective than traditional classroom learning, there are numerous benefits that can be gained from taking classes online. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of online classes and video conferencing for students, and investigate examples of how these methods of instruction have impacted students positively. We will also consider how students who are unable to get to school due to lack of transportation or other extenuating circumstances may benefit from taking classes at home. Additionally, we will explore the ways in which online classes and video conferencing can benefit teens who are victims of bullying.  Benefits of Online Classes and Video Conferencing  One of the main benefits of online classes and video conferencing is the flexibility they offer. Students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule, which can be especially helpful for those who have other commitments or responsibilities. Additionally, online classes and video conferencing can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, which means that students can learn from anywhere in the world.  Another benefit of online classes and video conferencing is that they can be more engaging than traditional classroom learning. With the use of interactive tools and multimedia content, students can be more actively engaged in the learning process. This can lead to better retention of information and a deeper understanding of the material.  Impact of Online Classes and Video Conferencing on Students  One group of students who may benefit greatly from online classes and video conferencing are those who are unable to get to school due to lack of transportation or other extenuating circumstances. For these students, taking classes online can be a convenient and effective way to continue their education. This can be especially helpful for students who live in rural areas or who have other responsibilities that make it difficult to attend school regularly.  Another group of students who may benefit from online classes and video conferencing are those who are victims of bullying. Online classes and video conferencing can provide a safe and supportive learning environment for these students. By avoiding the classroom, where they may be subject to bullying, students can focus on their learning and improve their individual performance. Additionally, online classes and video conferencing can provide opportunities for students to connect with others who share their interests and goals, which can be especially		1
The Electoral College its a process, not an actuall place. The Electoral College process works by a selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and they count the electoral votes by congress. I think this should not stand no longer because "under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."This is only one reason why the Electoral College should not be in progress. Another reason why is "If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."  "This explains why we as a hole nation united in one should change the Electoral College system to election by popular vote this allows everyones vote to be acounted for."The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. American people should say there pretty lucky that 2000 fiaaco was the biggest election crisis in a century;the system allows for much worse."Consider that state legislature are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."Now you might be getting an understanding of what I mean by we need to get rid of the electoral college method to popular vote.  "Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. But just because we did not get the electoral college removed doesnt mean we cant still try afterall we were close. The main problem with the electoral college is the fact that "each state casts only one vote, the single representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. "And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voter in Hawaii had voted the other way. "The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe." That is why the electoral college must end because it lets congress choose who they want to be leader not us.  That is why the electoral college must end because it lets congress choose who they want to be leader not us. That is my reason why.    		0
people would say that teachers are the best way of showing students how to get a better understanding on subjects like math, science, etc. Every student is different because, not all students learn the same way. there is away to help every student complete and get a better understanding on every subject. It is the "Facial Action Coding System" that can read the students facial emotion.  When there is a student that is getting bord or upset when a teacher is giving a lesson. The teacher cant just stop what they are doing to see what the student is upset or bord about. If schools allow students to have this kind of technology this may allow students to get a better undersatanding in the lesson. If a student is not understanding the lesson they will most likely lower there eye brows and in towards each other. This shows they dont understand what is going on. This will allow the computer to see why the student is not understanding or bord about. Than the computer will see this and modify the lesson so that the student will understand what is going on.  if a students is learning math on there computer and they are having trouble understanding what they are doing. The computer will see that they need help and it will most likely pull up a easyer way to solve the problems.  Having a school that will allow students to use this kind of technology may end up making it easyer for the student to understand there classwork or even homework. So this will allow the students to get better grades and having better understanding on the subject later on in life.		0
Dear Senator,  We should abolish the electoral college. It nakes voting unfair and is dangerous to the American society. It corrupts the soul of all Americans and makes people unhappy. If we want our society to live, we should end the electoral college.  The electoral college is extremely biased on the canditates and the voters have only a miniscule chance to elect the right voter. The chance is so miniscule that even an atom couldn't fit through it. On the counterclaim that it could be a tie, which has a higher percentage rate to tie, all of America, or 0.00000001% of the population of America? The canditates dont even focus on the states that aren't swing states, such as Wyoming or Alaska. If a president is from California, he/she already has 20% of the vote in his/her pocket. To make things worse, half of the states are not even into the campaign, voting canditates "they" think is best, not voting the canditates their state thinks is best.  To top it off, people are just so wooed by the canditate's ad, or their wealth, or their eyes, that they don't stop to think what the canditate could do for them. Just two years ago, I found myself talking to a women who needed Obamacare for her ill son, yet she was going to vote for Romney. People are just too dazzled by how things may seem, when it's just a huge marketing scam.  A large state gets more attention than a smaller state does... Is that what we really want in our country? After all these years of black equality and women's rights, we have decided to just completely ruin our entire form of government by being prejuice to other states. Yes, they may have a lesser population, but that doesn't mean anything. It just means that we are not giving people the right of suffrage.  Apparently, the electoral college elects a "clear winner", when the popular vote coiuld do that just fine on its own. Why do you think we have voting day for? I'm sure its so that the president that they didn't vote for was chosen by the elctoral college. Here's some logic, lets choose a selected number of people to vote for president instead of all of America. Isn't that a great idea.  "Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...." Really, is that why people vote? So you are saying that people vote just because they prefer, or like, the person other another candidate. So going back to my earlier point, people are just so amazed at their "something", that they just decide to take the effort to vote for them. No, people, that's not why, it's because they think they can make a change in the everyday world.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's all a game of cruel manipulation, Republicans manipulating the government so they get less taxes, Democrats manipulating the government to achieve free healthcare. It's a dangerous game, but the puppeteer who pulls the strings better than the last is the one who always wins.                                                            		0
I disagree with the principal's decision to require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities have many benefits, forcing participation denies student choice and can overburden some. Instead of a mandate, the school should encourage involvement through offering diverse options and highlighting opportunities.  Many students already have packed schedules with academic responsibilities as well as family and personal obligations. Requiring additional commitments risks creating stress if it means taking on more than one is able to handle well. Not all extracurricular activities are a good fit personally or practically for each individual either. Forcing involvement removes student autonomy over how to spend free time.   Rather than a mandate, a better approach is giving students more freedom to choose how to get involved, if at all. Presenting the wide array of options the school offers shows students the many potential benefits of extracurriculars without pressure. These may include opportunities to explore interests, enhance college applications, learn time management, relieve stress, and make new friends. Allowing choice respects that students have different strengths, priorities, and circumstances.  If some still do not wish to participate, that should be acceptable. Not all learn or benefit equally from group extracurricular activities. Individual students know themselves best and what environments allow them to achieve and feel engaged. Forcibly adding excessive commitments risks having the opposite effect intended and reducing well-being.   In conclusion, while extracurricular activities provide valuable learning experiences, requiring universal participation is not fair to all students. The principal's goal of involvement is better achieved through promoting opportunities, not mandates that limit choice. Students will be more likely to buy in and reap maximum benefits from activities they select themselves based on their own needs and interests.		1
Ralph Waldo Emerson famously wrote that, "Life is a journey, not a destination." This simple statement succinctly captures the importance of exploring beyond our comfort zones. In order to truly lead a fulfilled life, it is necessary to be willing to take risks, be open to new experiences, and try the things that challenge us. Doing so will yield tremendous rewards, both personally and professionally.   One great example of a person who stepped outside of their comfort zone and achieved amazing success is Oprah Winfrey. After rising up from an impoverished childhood, Oprah created an entire media empire despite not having any previous experience in the television and film industries. She took a risk, believed in her dreams, and ended up creating history with her tremendous success.   Another example of taking a leap of faith outside of one’s comfort zone is drawn from my own personal experience. When I was younger, I was incredibly shy and introverted and was always nervous and afraid to try new things. However, once I made the conscious effort to step out of my comfort zone, I have achieved more confidence and have gone on to accomplish some of my biggest life goals.   Ultimately, the best approach is to embrace the idea of continuing to explore and push limits. As Emerson said, “Do the thing you fear, and the death of fear is certain. ?Exploring beyond our comfort zones will always lead to personal growth and a deeper understanding of ourselves and our world.		1
i believe students should be able to bring a cell phone to school and be able to use it in passing times and free time. students often are late to class because they are talking to friends. If they were able to txt them they wouldn't have to run down to there locker and tell them and get books and do what they have to do. They could get to class on time and no ISR if they are needing a calculator during a study hall they could use there cell phone or if they needed to take notes and didn't get them they could take a picture of it. Students are often caught with cell phones in class txting if they were aloud to txt during free time they wouldn't have to text in class. students could pay more attention to school instead of worry about txting they would worry about that in there free time. Students could also txt there parents and tell them they are staying after school for something. Students should be able to bring phones to school and use them during free time as long as they are shut off during class time.		0
 Car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular in modern times. These cities strive to reduce their carbon footprint by encouraging the use of public transportation or alternative modes of transportation. In recent years, a number of cities around the world have taken steps to become car-free, and the results have been interesting and varied.  The most well-known example of a car-free city is Barcelona. In 2006, Barcelona introduced "Superblocks," which are areas in the city where all cars are banned. Instead of driving, citizens are encouraged to walk, bike, or use public transportation. The results have been significant - air pollution has decreased, and the streets are safer and quieter. This has led to increased tourism, as visitors are attracted to the unique and eco-friendly amenities.  Another example of a car-free city is Amsterdam, which has long been known for its cycling culture. The Dutch bicycle culture is so well established that Amsterdam has made the decision to invest heavily in expanding its bike infrastructure and to encourage the use of bicycles even more. The city is now one of the most bike-friendly in the world, with dedicated bike lanes and bike parking everywhere.  In London, the city has introduced "Congestion Charges," which require drivers to pay a fee to enter the city center. This has led to a significant reduction in car usage in the city center, and has encouraged the use of public transportation or other alternative modes of transportation. The results have been mixed, as some argue that this has led to increased pollution caused by buses and trucks, while others argue that it has led to a decrease in congestion and a cleaner environment.  Overall, car-free cities offer a unique and innovative approach to reducing carbon emissions and improving public safety. While not all cities have been able to completely eliminate cars, the concept of car-free cities has inspired many to take action to reduce their carbon footprint. As the world becomes increasingly concerned about climate change, it is likely that the car-free city movement will continue to grow and spread in the coming years.		1
Hello Mr. Senator,  I was writting to inform you about a topic that has been talked about for the past year, the Electoral Collage. This process has its pros and cons, but i'm more in the con side; you see the reason why the Electoral College needs to be abolished is because people dont really get to choose who their president is, the people who choose the president are the people in the Electoral College. How the Electoral College works is the state has electors and those electors have to be won by the president for the president to have how many electoral votes he gets from that state depending on how many electors that state has. The trick here is that sometimes the electors can deny the will of the people since the election is based on electoral votes not on popular votes, don't get me wrong people's votes do influence electors in deciding which president won their votes. Overall the electoral college is unfair to everyone because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states that they have no chance winning over so they got to the "swing" states since they have more chance of winning them over depending on their campaing. I don't think we should be trusting people to vote for us because as we have seen some electors vote for the candidate they want to win and not the candidate their state wants to win. Thats my rant about the Electoral College and I hope it makes you see clearer.  Best Regards, Alberto             		0
Hey, ya gotta check this out! So, like, Albert Schweitzer said, "Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing." And let me tell ya, it's totally relevant to how our behavior affects other people's attitudes.  So, like, Albert Schweitzer was this super smart dude who lived a long time ago, and he knew that actions speak louder than words. He saw how people's behavior can shape the way others think and feel, and he was all about spreading positivity. He believed that when we set a good example, it can have a huge impact on how others see the world.  For instance, if you're always super nice to people, they're gonna start thinking that being nice is cool and they'll wanna be like that too. And if you're always, like, bullying people, they're gonna think it's okay to be mean and they might even start doing it too. See what I mean?  Albert Schweitzer learned all about this from his experiences in Africa. He saw how the local people there were super kind and compassionate, and he realized that their positive behavior was contagious. It made him realize that we can all make a difference by being good role models.  So, like, the next time you're thinking about how to influence someone's attitude, just remember what Albert Schweitzer said. It's not just about talking the talk, it's about walking the walk. If you wanna make a good first impression, start with a good last impression. Get it?  In conclusion, Albert Schweitzer's quote is super important because it shows us that our actions have the power to shape how others think and feel. So, let's all try to be good examples for each other, 'kay? Thanks for reading!		1
As an 8th grader, I have noticed that technology has become a huge part of our daily lives. From smartphones to laptops, and from social media to video games, technology is everywhere. While technology has made many things easier and more convenient, it also has its downsides. In this essay, I will discuss the negative and positive impacts of technology on people, the consequences of a lack of communication due to technology, and the ways in which children can become overly obsessed with technology.  One of the negative impacts of technology is that it can have a detrimental effect on people's mental and physical health. For example, excessive use of smartphones and social media can lead to addiction, anxiety, and depression. Moreover, sitting in front of screens for long periods of time can cause eye strain, headaches, and poor posture. On the other hand, technology can also have positive impacts on people's health. For instance, telemedicine and virtual consultations can make healthcare more accessible and convenient, especially for people living in remote areas.  Another consequence of a lack of communication due to technology is social isolation. While technology can connect people from all over the world, it can also lead to a decrease in face-to-face interactions. This can result in feelings of loneliness, disconnection, and isolation. Moreover, technology can also make it easier for people to spread false information and propaganda, which can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. However, technology can also facilitate communication and collaboration, making it easier for people to work together and share ideas.  Children are particularly susceptible to becoming overly obsessed with technology. They spend hours playing video games, scrolling through social media, and watching videos, which can lead to a lack of physical activity, poor sleep habits, and a decrease in creativity. Moreover, excessive screen time can also affect children's mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and other psychological problems. However, technology can also be a valuable tool for children's education, providing them with access to a wealth of information and educational resources.  In addition, technology has greatly improved work schedules and shopping experiences. With the rise of e-commerce, people can now shop from the comfort of their own homes, without having		1
 I agree with the statement that growth in life requires stepping out of one's comfort zone and trying new things. Some people strive to master certain skills or accomplishments in their lives, whether it be through their career, relationships, or personal pursuits.  For example, someone may dedicate themselves to mastering a certain skill or craft, such as playing a musical instrument or painting, and put in a lot of effort to improve. Similarly, people may try to be good friends to their closest companions, or work hard to maintain a stable job in order to provide for their families.  However, it's important to note that not everyone may be successful in their efforts to grow and improve. Some people may struggle to master certain skills or achieve their goals, and it can be frustrating and disheartening when they don't see the progress they were hoping for.  Additionally, some people may become overly competitive or competitive with themselves, leading to stress and conflict. For example, someone who is good at video games may become angry and upset when they lose, or someone who is trying to improve their physical fitness may become frustrated when they don't see the results they were hoping for.  In conclusion, while growth and improvement are important aspects of life, it's important to remember that not everyone may be successful in their efforts. It's important to be patient and understanding with ourselves and others, and to remember that progress may not always be linear.		1
Venus is the sister planet to are home planet of Earth. Venus is the closest planet to Earth and is the closest to the size of Earth. Earth and Venus are said to be sister planets because of theas facters. There is also reson to belive that venus was ones simeler to earth is termas of living condishins . Venus is worth studeang even if the planet is no longer sutibul for life.  Venus was once like earth so what hapend? Now it is one of the most inhbitabul planets in the solersistum with a averige surfes temprituer of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmosphere that is almost 97 persent cardon dioxide. The geravitashinal pull is also 90 times stronger than that of Earthes geravitashinal pull. Even with theas lnhabital condishens of Venus scientists continue to resertch Venus because of the fact that it was one just like Earth is today.  Even whith the fact that vanis is inhabitabul for human life. there is still so much that we can learn about not only venus but are own planet. NASA has evan been exploring to idea that we send a maned space craft to Venus so that there can be people exsurbing Venus from a close but safe distance. You never know the seacrits that hide on venus may even hold the key to the futcher of are own planet. 		0
Imagen the streets with no cars empty with only people on bikes and scootrers. The air is cleaner and every one can breath easier. If we stop useing cars this could be a realitly there would be less CO² Emissons. A lot of the deaths and major injeoreys would be decreased on a daily basis. Every one would be more fit and active. These are just a few reasons that giving up your car is a good idea.  if most people were to give up there car then there would be less CO² Emmissons andn the air would be cleaner. the cleaner the air the easier everyone can breath. if the CO  ² went down the the green house gasses would go down and the trees that absorbe in the gasses would have a easier time and globle warming would slowdown.  every day people die or are injerored in car accadents the loss affects the families to so if we get rid of cars then less people would die and there would be less greiving families. imagen how you would feel if any of your families died in a car crash.  if everyone had to walk or bike to work then everyone would be more fit and healthy. alot of americans are obeies i know i am to but if every one had to walk or bike insted of sit in a car and drive then every one would be more fit making a better labor force.  so if every one were to stop driiving and give up therer cars then everyone could breath better. there would be less death and less greaving familys. there would also be a more fit labor force for the jobs that needed to be done. i think that is a world i would want to live in dont you.

Students are often required to complete projects during their summer vacation to ensure they are continuing to learn and practice a subject. Teachers, those who assign and grade the projects, are the experts when it comes to their course. Students need to learn to think outside the box, and having the pressure to come up with their own assignment can be stress-inducing. While some may think students would be allowed more creative room if they made their own summer assignments, I believe teachers should design their students summer projects.  Teachers go to college to earn their education in a specific field in which they would like to teach. Therefore, they spend years upon years learning how to teach that subject of choice. They become experts. In no way is this to discredit the students, as for many, they eventually become very knowledgable in said subject. However, when asked who knows more about a class, it is without a doubt, the teacher. Therefore, why would a student be asked to create a summer assignment when the teacher is the expert in the course? The teacher knows the subject material, so they would also know what would be the most beneficial towards improving a student's knowledge on the course. The students are creative; however, they aren't masters, so they shouldn't be pressured to create their own project.  While some may argue this negates the students ability to express creativity, I believe this forces them to be more open minded. I was once assigned a project in my art class that required using colored pencils to create an abstract piece. I had no experience with the medium or style or artwork; I would have never chosen either. However, this project subsequently became my favorite pieces I've ever made. If one is presented with an assignment they find challenging and undisierable, they are then forced to use creativity to work with it. Rather than recieving the option to make a project they know will be good at and find easier, they are given something they have to work with. This, alone, allows them to make controlled choices about how they choice to complete an assignment.  The ability to choose allows freedom; however, in some cases, choice arrouses anxiety. When a student is posed with the freedom to create whatever assignment they would like over the summer, they may have no idea what to do. If every student has the ability to design different projects ,all completely different, they won't be able to work together or ask questions. While school is out, they most likely won't be able to ask their teachers for help one their summer projects. The stress is taken off their shoulders if they know their isn't another option, esspecially if they don't actually want to make their own assignment.  Summer projects are beneficial towards the developement of ones knowledge in a particular subject. In order for students to learn how to think critically and reduce stress, I believe teachers should design those summer assignments. Afterall, they are considered experts in their field. 		0
Dear principle,  You should require all students to perform community service because not only does it protect the environment it protects future generations and our community. For example say people were not taking care of the environment and throwing their garbage and littering in our rivers and streams, which leads to our drink water it would then be contaminated and the contamination of the water wouldn't just effect humans it would effect plants and animals as well. Or say that we were not recycling, all of our garbage would do straight to landfill's which would once again put humans, plants and animals in danger. Or perhaps we were letting the oil from our cars run out into streams and driving our car to places that we could easily walk to or letting the carbon monoxide from our cars pollute the air leaving more of a chance for global warming to happen.  All of this can be prevented if we just take thirty minutes out of our day and pick up loose trash in our neighborhood or park or just as simple as recycling plastics, papers, cardboards, glasses etc. Also students want have to worry about taking time away from hanging out with their friends because their friends can do it with them and they would be getting more done in half of the time. This plan will work if you put it into action and I strongly hope you take my request into recommendation.  Sincerely,  A concerned student		0
The whole purpose of democracy is to create a government that reflects the desires, opinions, and attitudes of the people being governed, but how can this be achieved if the people aren't fairly represented during election time, presidential or otherwise? This is the problem with the Electoral College system; it puts all of decision-making power in the hands of our electors, not the citizens themselves. To begin with, the electors selected by citizens are capable of defying the will of the people they were chosen to represent. Next, in the case of a tie, the opinions of millions of people would be overlooked. Finally, because the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on obtaining votes instead informing all voters about their intentions, only the influential "swing" states receive enough attention from candidates to make a well-informed decision when voting. When it comes to something as serious as the fate of our country, citizens cannot put their faith in the such a corrupt system as the Electoral College.  First of all, the Electoral College system creates a window of opportunity for "faithless" electors to take advantage of the power given to them by society during the voting process. Under the Electoral College, voters do not vote directly for who they want as president, but instead for a slate of electors, who in turn select the president. Although these electors may pledge themselves to a particular candidate, there is no way to determine whether or not they end up casting their vote according to the will of the people who put them in charge. Such an unpredictable turn of events could be avoided if only the outcomes of presidential elections were determined by popular vote, not through an Electoral College.  Secondly, if a tie were to occur, the opinions of countless citizens would be ignored. In this case, the election would be thrown to the House of representatives, were delegates from each state would vote on the president. Since each state has only one vote to cast, a vote from a state containing 500,000 people would carry the same weight as a vote representing the opinions of 35 million. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the selection made by the House of Represenatives can hardly be expected to respesent the will of the people.    		0
 Should students enjoy less winter break and more summer vacation? Why would they change the vacation time? Can't it just stay the same as usual? Would the students like that change? Are those changes going to help the students in their studies?  The idea of changing the vacation time from summer to winter has been a topic of debate for many years. Some students argue that they would prefer to have more summer vacation and less winter break, while others believe that the current vacation time is just right. In this essay, we will explore the arguments for and against changing the vacation time and determine whether it would be beneficial for students.  On the one hand, some students may not like the idea of having less summer vacation and more winter break. During the winter months, it can get very cold, and students may not be able to go outside or participate in outdoor activities. Additionally, some students may argue that they prefer to have a break from school during the summer, when the weather is warm and they can relax and have fun.  On the other hand, some students may argue that having more summer vacation and less winter break would be beneficial. During the summer months, students can take advantage of the nice weather to explore nature, go to the beach or amusement park, or even go camping. Additionally, having more vacation time during the summer could help students recharge and be more focused during the school year.  Ultimately, whether or not to change the vacation time from summer to winter is a decision that should be made based on the needs and preferences of the students. If students do not like the change, they may not be as motivated to return to school and may ignore the new vacation time. However, if students are okay with the change, it could potentially be beneficial for their studies and overall well-being.  In conclusion, the decision to change the vacation time from summer to winter is a complex one that requires careful consideration of the needs and preferences of the students. While some students may prefer to have more summer vacation and less winter break, others may prefer to keep the current vacation time. Ultimately, the best decision will be one that takes into account the needs and preferences of the students and is designed to help them succeed academically and personally.		1
Graduating early from high school can be a great opportunity for motivated and actively engaged students who are looking to take their education to the next level. While leaving the traditional high school structure may come with some drawbacks, there are also many potential benefits. Early graduates may be eligible for college credit, may be able to access more school choice options, and may be able to save on college tuition costs by finishing their schooling more quickly. Additionally, there may be additional adult opportunities available to early graduates that their peers who stay the traditional route may miss out on.   However, early graduates face increased levels of responsibility for their own education that requires more planning and self-direction. Early graduates may miss out on traditional high school activities and may end up with an academic gap between applying for college and leaving high school, especially if college classes or advanced coursework have not been completed. The decision to graduate early from high school should not be taken lightly, and careful consideration should be given to the potential advantages and disadvantages to ensure that the best decision is made.		1

 The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a method used to analyze the subtle and unconscious movements of the face in order to infer an individual's emotions. Developed by Paul Ekman, it is a comprehensive system for recognizing and classifying human expressions based on the unique facial actions that accompany them.  FACS is based on the idea that just about every emotion we experience is expressed on the face, and that those expressions are universal. It is a particularly useful tool for understanding complex emotions, such as embarrassment or anger, that can be difficult to interpret based on verbal cues alone. FACS provides a way to identify and interpret these subtle expressions that may be too subtle for the average observer to detect.  One of the key principles of FACS is that every emotion is represented by a distinct set of facial actions. For example, happy expressions are associated with smiling and raised cheeks, while angry expressions are associated with furrowed brows and tight lips. FACS can also be used to identify the intensity of an emotion based on the speed and duration of the facial actions.  FACS has a number of applications in various fields. In psychology, it can be used to study and analyze the facial expressions of subjects in various experimental conditions. For example, it can be used to determine the emotional responses to different stimuli or to examine the facial expressions that accompany different levels of arousal. In anthropology, FACS can be used to study the facial expressions of different cultures and to compare them for similarities and differences.  Overall, the Facial Action Coding System is a powerful tool for understanding and interpreting human emotions. It provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing facial expressions and for identifying the distinctive facial actions that are associated with different emotions. By using FACS, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex and subtle ways in which we express ourselves, and how others interpret our emotions.		1
While there have been presidents that have run without earning the popular vote, it does not mean that the Electoral College is inefficient, bad, or unnecessary.  The Electoral College, chosen by our founding fathers, is a process in which people elect for electors.  Then the electors vote for the president.  Each state gets a certain number of electors, or electoral votes, depending on their population.  This way, no single group of people can sway the voting largely.  Instead, only the state would be effected.  Without a doubt, the Electoral College has been working well for centuries, and I see no good reason to change it.  For starters, it is much easier than a popular vote to decide.  Yes, the chance for a tie is there, but to count each state rather than each and every single vote is much easier nowadays.  Counting such a plurality of votes is already a difficulty, even right here in the Sun Shine State.  Imagine counting all the votes right down to the last one!  Even though a tie is more likely this way, the odds of a tie are so rare, what does it matter?  Another truly great thing is the fact that any president must have appeal to all states, or at least most.  Having the favor in the south and concentrating it there will not give you more votes.  In fact, it is more likely you will not be president if you yeild strongly to any one region.  Doing so may lose you many votes in other areas that may be difficult to recapture.  If a president was for say, leaning towards big old California and Florida, but not going very much for the other states, then yes, he may win many, many votes from California and Florida and possibly win the election, if it was a popular vote.  But this is not the case.  In an electoral votes, winning all votes in a few states is hardly useful.  That, of course, plays majorly into elections, which is a reason why some of your favorite presidential candidates didn't win.  Another great thing I am to mention is loss of plurality.  What if my buddy and I each got only 40% of the votes.  The other guy in Tex. got the other 20%.  Who would win?  In the Electoral College, the Tex. dude may win a few votes in each state, but rarely will he win any.  With the Electoral College, other minor candidates are less likely to screw the whole thing up.  It is true there have been faults.  Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO have all antagonized the Electoral College.  One reason is that electorals do not have to vote for whom ever they chose in the beginning.  If my vote gets some Bob McShnuffle into the electoral voting system, but he votes for someone other than my choice, then there is going to be major pandemonium.  Is it fair that your vote and so many others gets flipped just because Bob McShnuffle was unhappy with that president?  Perhaps, but this does not happen often.  Usually, it does not cause too much of a balance tipping.  But the true problem is the word of the people.  We have so many speakers for us, but they don't always say the right things that we want.  Fortunately, these incidents do not happen all the time.  To fret over such things only offers you more problems and less solutions.  By having an elector, a representative, someone can't say something stupid and pull the whole country down with him.  Instead, this is the best way to address the majority of the people without conflict.  On that happy note, I must mention the electoral college is not perfect.  Nothing is.  But it is easier than popular voting, counts all states and regions, and naturally avoids run-offs.  Of course, its still got its flaws.  But you have to admit that those founding fathers did pretty good.  Arguably, it has been the best way for the presidential election, and it still is...    		0
"If you want it you have to see it with a clear eye view." This is a lyric from Meek Mill's song, Dreams and Nightmares. If students are expected to benefit from a situation and understand the material, they have to be present in the correct environment in order to have a better understanding of the material, which allows them to have a clear eye view. Being in a school setting does not only allow them to have a better understanding of the material, but it also minimizes the possible distractions that learning from home may include. Online classes are not always reliable, the internet can stop working at any time or technical difficulties can occur. Students are more likely to succeed in academic subjects if they're in a school environment which allows them to be fully submerged in their studies, it provides them with skills that may be useful; it gives them the opportunity to create friendships and memories that may impact them for a lifetime.  One's performance and achievement can be heavily impacted by the environment they are in. Students have a better understanding of subjects they're being taught if they're in the adequate learning environment. Students taking online classes can be easily distracted by technological devices that are easily accessible especially in the comfort of their own home. The separation of school life and home life can have a positive impact on a student's life. For example, if a student is having problems at home, they can escape them temporarily by going to school. This allows them to have a mental break which can help improve their overall health and well being. Constantly being at home creates an imbalance by mixing a student's academic focuses with their personal life. They'll end up not dedicating the sufficient amount of time nor attention to either one. Having a designated location for school allows students to better understand the material, it also creates their own space for their personal life.  School is not only a place where one can learn, it is also a place where students can develop multiple skills that will carry on with them throughout their life. For example, being in a typical classroom requires one to perform many tasks such as presenting in front of the class or working with classmates. These tasks allow students to develop social skills, teamwork skills, and communication skills to name a few. On the other hand, students taking online classes may not be able to acquire the amount of skills that students attending school have. These are crucial skills that will help them when they enter the work force, as well as in their everyday life. For instance, individuals that are home schooled may not be as comfortable or used to being around people, which can create difficulties for them when they stop taking classes; due to the fact that many jobs require one to work with others as a team. Which ultimately benefits those who have had prior experiences in those situations.  The memories and friendships one creates in school are carried on throughout one's life. Individuals who attend school have the opportunity to meet and bond with others. They can create memories and experiences that one can only obtain in a school setting. Some examples of this include: school dances, sports games, after school clubs, and assemblies. These are the events that are the most memorable from attending school. Attending a classroom enables students to form relationships with their teachers, which can facilitate the learning process. Taking online classes may keep one from experiencing what makes going to school and learning more enjoyable.  Attending school comes with many memorable experiences, most students who take online classes do not get to experience these memorable events. The environment one is in can greatly affect one's academic performance, which is why school would be the best environment to learn in since it's free of distraction, which cannot be guaranteed from attending online classes from home. The internet is not always reliable, it can go out at any moment which negatively affects a student's learning. Online classes would not be the most ideal when it comes to benefiting a student; learning in a school setting will improve a student's performance, it gives them the opportunity to make friendships and memories, and it allows them to develop crucial skills that they'll always need.		0
Would you want to spend the entire summer on a project that youre not getting a grade for, not enthusiastic about, and are never going to see again in your life? Well that is exactly how students feel about teacher-designed projects. It is important for students to meet the teachers half-way in all classroom situations. It is the teacher's responsibility to set expectations and requirements, as well as help the students get things done. However, it is the student's responsibility to accept that help and actively participate in class. But, it can be hard to do that unless you care about the topic being presented. That being said, I believe that these summer projects should be designed and executed by the students. The teachers should lay out their expectations and the students should try to exceed them. I believe this because, in my experience, when teachers try to tell the students exactly what to do, they feel that the teachers don't trust them to make their own decisions. This is also a way to motivate the students to continue learning. If students could decide what they wanted to learn more about, and focus on that rather than what the teachers want, then they are likely to be more interested. Furthermore, allowing students to design their own projects, forces them to be creative and think outside of the box, thus developing skills that could be helpful in the future.  One reason that student-designed projects are better than teacher-designed projects is that the former give students the opportunity to show what they care about. If students are given the opportunity to design their own projects, it is likely that they are going to pick a topic that they are enthusiastic or passionate about. When they do, they will want to continue to learn more about it. For example, My brother is not very interested in the typical things they teach in middle school. He would much rather be building model kits or learning more about the ever-growing Star Wars universe and story line. But every year, at his middle school, they do this thing called a Passion Project, which allows students to pick any topic and complete a project on it --which they will present to their entire grade-- and every year my brother does it on machinery or weapons in the Star Wars universe. He puts a lot of time and effort into this project each year and the results are phenomenal, showing that with passion, you can accomplish anything to the best of your ability.  The next reason that student-designed projects are better is that teachers will be able to trust students to make reasonable academic decisions. If teachers gave students the opportunity to show that they can be studious, then teachers would trust students to make their own decisions and get work done without being micro-managed. I realized this when I was assigned a history project in sophomore year. We were put into groups of two, and were assigned to different genocides throughout history that we had to research and create a poster on. When I was assigned the Rwandan Genocide I was excited to start this project. The Rwandan Genocide was something that I had done research on before and I was enthusiastic about spreading the information to those who had not heard of it yet. This resulted in the teacher trusting me and my partner do our own work without her having to ask about our progress very often. That poster ended up getting a 100% and was one of the best posters I had created because I was enthusiastic about the topic.  Additionally, student-designed projects force the students to think about educational topics on their own, without adult guidance leading the whole process. Teaching yourself is a very important skill that you should have in the future. If students got into the habit of primarily relying on themselves, they are setting themselves up for success because every functioning adult needs self-reliance. Before someone grows up, they must first learn how to manage their own schedules, complete their own work, and rely on themselves rather than others to get things done. The best time to learn those things is as a teenager. If teachers are designing and managing students' projects, then what exactly is the student learning? In student-designed projects, the student is the one making all of the decisions that affect the project, which is why they can be beneficial to young teenagers. Students must learn and understand how to take their lives (and projects) into their own hands.  To conclude, not only do student-designed projects motivate the students by allowing them to use their enthusiasm to fuel their education, but they also help students become more independent and self-reliant by teaching them how to design and manage a project on their own. Student-designed projects also help teachers form a trust with their students by allowing them to show that they can take control of their own academic life. These skills can be helpful throughout the coming school year, and life, as well.		0
Sports, working on a year book, and serve on the student council are great extracurricular activities. I don't agree with all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some students have to take care of their younger brothers and sisters because kids don't know how to take of themselves. For example, you leave a kid alone for one day he/she will cry, pout, and scream because he/she are scared, alone, and frighten. Kids are still young and clueless. Some students also may have already participated in other activities outside of school, like hockey, football, and many more. I do not think they would want to participate in a school activity because it's a waste their of time and they are already doing an activity outside of school. Students also need to get some rest and sleep not doing an school activity almost everyday. For example, I would hate doing an school activity almost everyday because most of the time I'm lazy and all I want to do is relax and sleep. These days students are lazy and addicted to social media because life is boring and barley fun. Students have other problems to work out at home, like family problems, personal problems, and sickness problems. Some of them would probably not attend school activities or school. Students should not particapte at least one extracurriclar activity. It is up to he/she choice if he/she wants too or not nobody should be forced to participate in an school activity.		0
Dear Principle i have herd that you are deciding whether all students should perform in the community service. I think it will be a great idea for our school and for our community. This will be able to help people know that if we do are work together as a group we will accomplish more work and that not just one man can do everything but if we are united we will succeeds. By doing all of this it will be able to make are town cleaner and let people know that we care about this town. By the way this will be a great opportunity for our community to be clean so if different people who comes from different places will make good judgement about are community and maybe they might tell their friends how they think about it. I hope you make your mind to say yes but whatever you choose I will still be happy with it.  Sincerely STUDENT_NAME		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I have a complaint I have a grade C average and I would like to play sports and I'm a great athlete and you can ask the couches. The couches had ask me to play sports but then they did not know that i need a B average to play sport. I really think u should change that policy because there are a lot of good sports player but they cant play because they have a grade C average. I don't think you want this school remember as the worst player in all the sports. So if you don't want to here all the nonsense from the students and from the couches so the best thing to do is change that policy. Most people are really upset so am I, but if you don't change I am pretty positive that no one will go to this school anymore and once we leave this school you will be closed down		0

Enthusiasm is an essential aspect of life that helps us to achieve our goals and overcome obstacles. It is the driving force behind our motivation, and it can help us to stay focused and committed even when faced with failure. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of enthusiasm in life and provide examples of how to maintain it, even in the face of adversity.  Firstly, enthusiasm is crucial in achieving success in any area of life. It is the spark that ignites our passion and drives us to pursue our goals with vigor. As the famous author, Winston Churchill, once said, "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts." Enthusiasm allows us to keep pushing forward, even when we face setbacks and failures. It helps us to see the bigger picture and to keep our eyes on the prize.  For example, let's consider the story of J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series. Rowling faced numerous rejections from publishers before finally finding success with her first book. However, she never lost her enthusiasm for writing and continued to work on her stories, even in the face of failure. Eventually, her persistence paid off, and the Harry Potter series became one of the most successful book series of all time.  Secondly, enthusiasm is essential in maintaining a positive attitude and outlook on life. When we are enthusiastic about something, we tend to see the world in a more positive light. This can help us to overcome challenges and find opportunities where others may see only obstacles. As the philosopher, Aristotle, once said, "The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet." Enthusiasm helps us to endure the hardships of life and to savor the rewards that come with perseverance.  For example, let's consider the story of Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Inc. Jobs faced numerous setbacks and failures throughout his career, but he never lost his enthusiasm for innovation and design. This enthusiasm helped him to create some of the most iconic products in history, such as the Macintosh computer and the iPhone.  In conclusion, enthusiasm is an essential aspect of life that helps us to achieve our goals and maintain a positive attitude. It is the driving force behind our motivation and		1

I am against the use of animals in scientific research. It is cruel and unnecessary to subject animals to painful and often deadly procedures for the sake of human advancement. There are alternative methods that can be used, such as computer models and in vitro testing, that do not involve harming animals.  Firstly, animals used in research are often subjected to painful and distressing procedures. For example, in toxicity testing, animals are force-fed or injected with potentially harmful substances to observe their effects. This can cause immense suffering for the animals involved, and in some cases, death. It is not ethical to subject animals to such treatment when there are alternative methods available.  Secondly, animals used in research may not always provide accurate results. Animals and humans have different physiological and genetic makeup, which means that the results of animal testing may not always translate to humans. This can lead to misleading results and potential harm to humans who use drugs or treatments based on animal testing.  Lastly, there are alternative methods available that do not involve animals. For example, computer models can simulate the effects of drugs and treatments on human cells and tissues, providing accurate results without harming animals. In vitro testing, which involves using human cells and tissues in a lab setting, is another alternative that does not involve animals.  In conclusion, the use of animals in scientific research is unethical and unnecessary. There are alternative methods available that can provide accurate results without causing harm to animals. We should prioritize the welfare of animals and use methods that do not involve their suffering.		1
My claim is going to be on the negative aspect on driverless cars. The one of the reasons that I am going to use is road problems. Also the next problem that I am going to be talking about is a pass for the drivers crime on a crash. The next thing I am going to talk about is the finacial rate. These are the most troubling thing that are running around in my mind.  The first of the many problems is the road problems that can hurt any one on the road. If there is a sewer problem in the middle of the street that the city workers are working on the driverless cars won't have a way to detect the workers. Yes they might install a camera or a sensor to indicate that and alert the driver, but it can alert him to late and the result on that is there is already a crash. Also the car can't tell whether their is a red light or a green light it can only go to the direction it was programed to go to. There can be many more problems that anyone else can say that I'm not saying and think to your self's "why do they need to alert you before the car doesn't know how to drive a certain way".  The second reason for the negative aspect of the driverless cars is the passes on a crash. I think that if a person is going to court for getting in a crash because of his driverless car. I am not saying that he should get punished for buying that car, but they should understand that that they should be watching the road. And if someone says that the were sleeping while the car was driving they should go to jail for it. Their might be a worst punishment for it, but they should already know the bad side of the driverless car is not a game.  The last reason i am going to talk about is the finacial rate. Well I should call it money problems for everyone, but I wanted to sound smart. The company will have to sell them expensive prices because of the hardware, software, and other technology that is being combined with the car is not cheap. The people that would want to buy or rent it would have to do alot of work just to buy the car. Buy alot of work I mean he has to win the lottery and still work to still make payments on the car.  There is alot more reasons but i leave it up to the different people that are going to write about it. I hope to the people that read this that there is a positive and a negative side to everything. But it is your life but make the right choices and make sure don't make any mistakes. And i wish you the best and the wish you good luck out there in the driverless car world.		0
Throughout the school year, students are overwhelmed with mandatory classes and time-consuming activities. Today's students are more stressed than ever as they tried to keep up with their advanced classes and heavy workload. This often leaves students having to pick between their extracurricular and their school work, leaving them very little time to just be kids. Summer gives students the opportunity to relax and enjoy the world, but for many students summer assignments interfere. Allowing students to design their own summer assignments enables them to learn about something they are interested in all while continuing to emphasize the importance of learning in their daily lives.  Students are given very little opportunity to take classes that appeal to them or that will benefit them in their future careers. Most high schools have a certain number of mandatory classes that must be taken to graduate and grant students only one or two electives. Giving students the ability to pick their own summer project lets them get the chance to explore a topic of their interest. A self-chosen project would feel less like a stressful job and more of an adventure. This would evoke passion in students and teachers will see better work in return. Additionally, students should not be limited to pick between certain topics, they should be able to choose anything from science to sports, and anll that falls inbetween. Introducing their own passions through a student-selected activity may even bring the joy of learning back after a school year full of stress.  Schools often placed students in a box and present them with one way to learn. Standardize tests and their GPA start to define kids and throughout the school year, kids begin to loose interest in school and count down the days till summer. There is love of learning has been abandoned and each class drags on. Schools have the responsibility to engage their students and prepare them for life, a student-chosen summer project is a step in that direction. Schools that have started this have seen increased participation in the summer projects and more students are willing to learn throughout the school year.  Consequently, schools must maintain some rules for their summer projects. Education is the most powerful tool a person can have and should be treated with such importance. Learning should be incorporated into your everyday and should not be placed on the back-burner during summer break. Schools must enforce a level of complexity to the project to ensure that the projects are of equal effort. For example, a student can not call watching television their passion. It is important to acknowledge all types of interests but giving students free range on a summer assignment could result in laziness or incomplete work. However, students who treat this project as a last minute event is more of a reflection on the student than the project itself. Nevertheless, schools must present some authority in assigning the project while still maintaining the idea of enabling students to explore their interests.  Allowing students to select their own summer project is both beneficial to the students and the school. Teachers have all year to assign their own projects and summer is the perfect time for it be the students turn to explore their own passions and learn about an unknown topic. Although, initially schools will have to place some rules on the project the opportunity to bring the joys of learning back to kids is something that can not be pass up. 		0
you're best way to learn? well, I think the kids that are studying from their house have benefits because they can do their class work at anytime they want in the day. Like they can turn in classwork after they get off work. Because you have unlimited amount of time to do it. The student that is doing online class would have more time to sleep and, eat their breakfast and whenever they are ready to start their work, they can start working. They don't have to wake as earlier as the rest of the people going to school. Theres less work you get more time to do what you got to do and if got other class online you can will be able to finish the work because they give a lot of time to complete the units. It's good because if a student don't like going to school they have another way of doing work. another reason that online school is good because if you finish all you're work for the online class you can take a break till they give you more work and, once you finish all the work for the year your done for the year. Those are the many reasons I think online class are benefited to some students in school.  But at the sometime their disadvantages of taking online class because you don't have someone to help when your having trouble on homework. Like you will be very confused about the subject,and you won't know what to do. Or if you lose internet you won't be able to turn in the work cause their's no connection. Or if you forget to do your online classwork. You also have to complete the in a specific amount of time. Like if you don't finish on time it possible ruin your chance of passing the online class. Another reason why online can't be as good as normal school is because the person doing the online class isn't getting one on one contact with other students and teachers. Also if you start having problems with the website to do your online work it would be difficult for the student to finish his work. These are the many disadvantages of taking online class. If i was to pick between these option, I would pick going to normal school because you might have problems with website,internet or you might just forget about it. But i would pick school cause you can talk to the teacher when your having trouble on the work or, you just need extra help on things in class.		0
Each and every day around the world, thousands of students are given assignments or projects they must complete and turn in for a proficient grade, some of these projects are assigned during the school year and sometimes they are assigned during the summer when students are on vacation just to help with their continued learning. Summer projects should be student-designed. Many students would be so much more successful and accurate if their summer projects were student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because students make topics sound easier than teacher-designed projects, teacher-designed projects take quite some time to complete, and students make projects and topics more enjoyable.  Students make school topics sound more simple than teachers. Usually when a teacher designs a summer project there is a lot to it and makes simple subjects or topics sound more difficult than what it actually is. As an example if a teacher were to assign an English summer project there would be three sheets of paper and a whole lot of words to it, but if a student were to assign an English summer project then there would be less wording and it would get straight to the point. Another example could be a teacher designing a history project. If a teacher were to design a history summer project then the directions would be unclear and confusing for most students, but if a student were to design a history summer project then the directions would be simple.  Furthermore, teacher-designed projects can take quite some time to complete. Students enjoy projects that are quick and enjoyable to complete in a timely manner. Teacher-designed projects are long and drawn out, sometimes it can even take a student a month or two to get one summer project complete. If a student were to design a summer project then it would be quick, simple, and would probably only take a week or two to complete. An example of this would be a typical summer reading project, they are designed by teachers. Most of the time students will wait the week before the summer reading is due to start it just because of how drawn out they are. But if a student were to design the summer reading project, then it would not take that much time to complete and the student would get it done in a much more timely manner.  Some people might say that teacher-designed summer projects are efficient and accurate, but most of the time these "efficient and accurate" projects are very uninteresting for students to complete. Teacher-designed projects usually require the student to read something out of a textbook and answer guided reading questions, this is not interesting to students at all. If a student were to design a summer project for a specific topic, then for most students it would actually be enjoyable. An example would be a student getting a summer project for mathematics. These teacher-designed math projects usually require the students to solve a lot of problems, this could take days, weeks, or months for the student to complete because it is not interesting. If a student were to design a math project it would probably require them to do something that applies to their everyday life, which is very interesting for a student.  In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because students make topics sound more simple than teacher-designed projects, teacher-designed projects take more time to complete, and students make summer projects more enjoyable to complete. Students would not have to stress over the project being too difficult or unclear, the student would be able to complete the project on time, and they would enjoy doing the project during their summer vacation. Students can be the reason other students succeed with their projects or assignments and they could learn so much from each other just from one simple summer project. 		0
 Car-free cities have become a popular topic in recent years as more and more cities around the world have started to adopt this concept. The idea of creating a city that is free of cars sounds great, but is it really feasible? In this essay, we will explore the benefits of car-free cities, the challenges that arise with this concept, and whether or not it is worth pursuing.    Car-free cities are becoming increasingly popular in Europe, where many cities have started to ban cars from parts of their downtowns. This has led to a cleaner and healthier environment in the city center, as well as reduced noise pollution and fewer accidents. It has also led to a revitalization of the economy, as people are more likely to spend money on goods and services in a safe and well-designed environment.    Another benefit of car-free cities is that they can encourage people to use alternative modes of transportation such as cycling and walking. This helps to reduce the number of cars on the roads, leading to less congestion and slower traffic. Additionally, it can promote an active and healthy lifestyle for the population.    However, there are also challenges that come with the concept of car-free cities. One of the main challenges is the need for alternative transportation options. People in these cities need to be able to get around efficiently and quickly in order to go to work, school, and other important destinations. This requires the development of efficient transportation systems that are reliable and affordable.    Another challenge is the cost of implementing a car-free city. This includes the cost of installing bike lanes, sidewalks, and other infrastructure necessary to support the transportation systems. These costs can be significant, and the cost of the infrastructure needed to support car-free cities may make it difficult for some cities to make it a reality.    In conclusion, car-free cities offer many benefits, but they also come with their own challenges. While they can lead to a cleaner and healthier environment, as well as a revitalized economy, they require the development of efficient transportation systems and the installation of new infrastructure. The cost of implementing a car-free city may also be significant. Ultimately, whether or not car-free cities are worth pursuing will depend on the resources available to each city, and the willingness of its population to embrace alternative modes of transportation.		1
extracurricular Activities  Some principles decide that all of their students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity. I agree with making students participate in extracurricular activities because of a few reasons. First, all students can get the chance to participate in a sport. And the extracurricular activity you choose to participate in can prepare you for your future.  I think it is important for students to participate in sports because It gets you in better physical shape. And when you are in better shape you feel more confident in yourself which will make you more focused on your goals. And because you believe in yourself and you know you have the strength to keep pushing and you know you can reach those goals. and your heart and the rest of your body will become stronger. Several studies have proven that exercise is good for your mental heath and your hearts health. Which will make you live longer and be happier.  even though the school is making you participate in extracurricular activities you get to choose the extra curricular activity you want to participate in. You get to choose something you are passionate about and you will have fun doing. And it will be great practice if you want to grow up and do that for a living. If you are participating in an extracurricular activity and it is something you want to do when you grow up, you will be way more experienced then everyone else. And when you apply for a job your employer will see that you are more experienced and qualified then everyone else. For example, if I joined the Marine Biology club I would spend years learning and doing things marine biologists would do. So I would be experienced and have more practice then all of the other people who also want to be marine biologists. I will have the upper hand because I already know things they are just starting to learn about.  I agree with making students participate in extracurricular activities. I agree with making students participate in extracurricular activities because they can better prepare you for the future and be ahead of everyone else. And participating in sports will make you more confident so you can believe in yourself. Also it is good for your heart and mental health to exercise. That is why I think participating extracurricular activities is so important and so important to students lives.		0
Once there was a girl named Generic_Name, who was going to try Chipotle for dinner for the first time, was asking her best friend, Generic_Name, what she should order. "Oh!" Generic_Name exclaimed, " you should get a bowl with white rice and chicken. It will make you feel like you are in heaven!"  " No, no!" pouted Generic_Name's other best friend, Generic_Name, "you have to get barbacoa as your meat and a lot of cheese, it will melt right in your mouth!"  " Come on don't listen to her, I guarantee that you will love chicken way more than barbacoa!" shouted Generic_Name.  When Generic_Name got home that evening from school she asked her parents whether they think she should get barbacoa or chicken as her meat.  " Well I personally think that you should get barbacoa as your meat, it has a wonderful juicy and flavorful taste." said her mother.  " Yeah, every time I go there I have always gotten barbacoa, it has this spectacular taste." her father added.  So when they went to Chipotle that night, Generic_Name ordered a bowl with white rice, barbacoa, and a lot of cheese.  " Mmmm, this is really good guys, thanks for the advice!" said Generic_Name happily. Asking for opinions or advice from multiple people is helpful because people have different opinions, some people may have bad advice or opinions, and it may help you change your mind about something.  To start off, asking for opinions or advice from multiple people is helpful because everyone may have different opinions. Not everyone likes the same things and it also maybe nice to hear what other people have to say about things. If you were to go around your school or work and ask people what they think could be better about their working environment, not all of them are going to say the exact same thing. Some people may say that they want bigger and better bathrooms, more food options in the cafeteria, a neater and quieter work space, a longer lunch time, and many more. That is the thing with asking people for their advice and opinions, you never know or expect what they are going to say, but it can also make it harder for you to choose something since so many people gave you advice and they were all different. That is one reason how asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you.  To continue, another reason why asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you is because some people have bad advice and opinions. You may ask the wrong person for their advice, they could be untrustworthy and a bad influence, also some of your friends who you think are your true friends and will give you good advice maybe be the exact opposite. Someone will possibly try to get you in trouble and give you the wrong advice on purpose. For example, there was a boy named Generic_Name, he was an all A student and did fantastic in school. One night, Generic_Name was trying to decide whether he should study for his French or Algebra test first, so he called his friend, Generic_Name. He told Generic_Name to take his advice to not study at all and for him to sneak out late at night and go to a huge party that Generic_Name is having at his house. But then Generic_Name deiced to call Generic_Name to ask for his opinion.  "Oh don't listen to Generic_Name, his brain is about a size of a peanut, he is just trying to get you in trouble, you know he is a bad influence. I personally think you should study French first." said Generic_Name.  " Yeah I guess you are right," agreed Generic_Name, "Generic_Name is a bad influence and he should be studying as well."  If Generic_Name did not call Generic_Name to ask for his advice he would have left home late and gone to Generic_Name's party. That is another reason how asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you.  The last reason asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you is because it may help you change your mind about something, just like Generic_Name when he asked Generic_Name for his opinion. If you were thinking about doing something you weren't really sure of and asked your friends or family members what they thought, they can lend you pretty good advice that could possibly change your mind about doing something you were not completely sure of. For example, you could be thinking about getting a blue sweatshirt and ask your sister what she thinks, "Oh no don't get the blue, get green instead, it really brings out your eyes." she says.  That is my final reason how asking for opinions or advice from multiple people can help you.  In conclusion asking for opinions or advice from multiple people is helpful because people have different opinions, some people may have bad advice or opinions, and it may help you change your mind about something. Not everyone always thinks the same way about things and some people have just have bad advice, if everyone were to ask multiple people for advice, they are more likely to make the right and better decision.      		0
As a NASA scientist I know more about how the Face is not made from aliens. First off how would aliens create the face because they probably never seen a human. We never seen any evidence that supports that aliens are real. So how would aliens create the face if we don't have any evidence that they are real?  The face is made from rocks. Rocks like from Mars. The face is just a natural landform nothing else. Since the Face is made from Rocks and is on Mars it is called a mesa. Its basically a huge rock formation eveyone would say, even I would say it. There might have been an ancient civillization there, but we are still finding out new stuff everyday.  Yes the face has been a pop icon. It has appeared in many books, magazines even radio talk shows. Some people even think that it is possible that there is somehow life there on Mars.  You shouldn't believe that aliens really did make the face. We don't have any proof that aliens are even real. So we can't say that aliens made the face. Since there are humans are Earth then there could probably once have been humans on Mars, but we have no clue at all. So far its just a natural landform since we have no proof its made from humans or even possible aliens. 		0
In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This is due to a number of factors, including the environmental impact of cars, the cost of car ownership, and the health risks associated with driving.  One of the main reasons to limit car usage is the environmental impact of cars. Cars are a major source of air pollution, which contributes to climate change and other environmental problems. In addition, cars require a lot of energy to produce and operate, which contributes to our reliance on fossil fuels.  Another reason to limit car usage is the cost of car ownership. Cars are expensive to buy, insure, and maintain. In addition, parking can be a major expense, especially in urban areas. As a result, many people find that it is cheaper to use public transportation or rideshare services than to own a car.  Finally, driving can be dangerous. Car accidents are the leading cause of death for people under the age of 35. In addition, driving can contribute to stress and obesity. As a result, many people are looking for ways to reduce their reliance on cars.  There are a number of ways to limit car usage. One way is to live in a walkable or bikeable community. This means living in a place where you can easily get around without a car. In many cities, there are now "complete streets" that are designed for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists.  Another way to limit car usage is to use public transportation. Public transportation is a great way to get around without a car. It is also a good way to save money and reduce your environmental impact.  Finally, you can also carpool or take rideshare services. Carpooling is a great way to save money on gas and parking. Rideshare services are a convenient way to get around without a car.  Limiting car usage is good for the environment, your wallet, and your health. There are a number of ways to limit car usage, so there is no excuse not to give it a try.  In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car usage. It is good for the environment, your wallet, and your health. There are a number of ways to limit car usage, so there is no excuse not to give it a try.		1
Hey there!  So, like, I'm supposed to write an essay about how it's hard to be myself in this crazy world, right?  Like, I know, it's a pretty deep topic and all, but I'll give it a shot.   So, let's face it, the world is changing faster than ever before.  Like, have you seen all the new technology and social norms lately? It's like, every day something new and different is popping up, and it's hard to keep up!  I mean, I'm just trying to navigate middle school and life in general, but it feels like the whole world is moving forward without me.   I mean, think about it. When I was born, we didn't have Instagram or TikTok or any of that stuff.  Now, it's like, everyone's constantly posting and sharing and curating their lives online, and it's just...  It's hard to keep up with the Joneses, you know?  Like, I don't even know who the Joneses are anymore!   And it's not just technology.  The social norms are changing too.  Like, when I was younger, it was cool to wear baggy clothes and listen to emo music.  Now, it's all about being "woke" and "inclusive" and stuff.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for being respectful and stuff, but it's hard to keep up with all the new rules and expectations.   I mean, I just want to be myself, you know?  But it feels like no matter what I do, I'm always getting judged or criticized or something.  Like, I'll wear a certain outfit and someone will be like, "Oh, that's so last season," or		1
Some might thing cars are essential to life, but other might think they don't need them at all. Limiting car use is a good thing because it limits the amount of fog, it reduces traffic jams and crashes, and people seem to be more family oriented. i believe that limiting car usage is a very helpful thing and a great idea.  We all know how badly cars gases are are and that without those harmful gasses there wouldn't be much fog. now imagine if this happened here in America. In Paris they band driving due to the near record pollution. They did this so they could have a day where the air would clear out and there wouldn't be that much fog. Some might think this is an excellent idea, but some might say its a very lousiness idea. Limiting car usage actually helps because your limiting how much of those harmful gases you put in the air. They tried this for a certain amount of time in Paris and that do you know! The smog cleared up enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for driving your cars. Now this is just one of the many great things limiting car usage has on our planet.  Something else similar to what they did in Paris happened in Colombia. They limited the car usage for one day to free up some of the congestion that they had in the capital (Bogota). This is also a great idea because people don't have to worry about crash crashing, people getting ran over, or kids getting hit by cars. People don't have to worry about a lot of harsh things, so they live a somewhat stress less life. In Bogota they are also making new parks for people because without cars you don't need to drive to parks you can just walk. People when they walk tend to have conversations with the people around them so they tend to have a more social and all in all better lifestyle. This could also help in places like New York or other very congested cities. Without all those cars filling up the roads with all there horrible gases, New York would have a very clean breathable air. Another thing is that they wouldn't have many traffic jams and/or many people getting in car crashes.  One of the most important reasons why limiting car usage is an advantage is because people are more family oriented. Studies have shown that when people don't have cars they fell like they don't have and debts and fell somewhat free. This will make a person more loving and more interested in family time. Also people tend to walk more and carpool, so this causes them to car pool or walk in groups and they do all of that with their own family. In Germany the citizens say life without a car is great. One citizen said how his life was so tense when he had a car and now without a car he is mush happier. Also America the percentage of drives have gone down by a lot. This is because people are unemployed, they don't have money to buy a car, or  they simply don't want to be tense and have a car.  Limiting car usage is a great ting and i believe people should at least try to make it happen. It helps reunite family's, clear the amount of fog, and it reduces car jams and accidents. Some people might think its not a very good idea but some might think it is. So people should at least try to see what happens.                            		0
 Graduating from school is a significant milestone in one's life. It represents the completion of a significant educational journey and the achievement of a set of goals. Graduating from school also marks the beginning of a new chapter in one's life, as it opens up new opportunities and possibilities for further education and career advancement.  One of the primary reasons why graduating from school is important is that it allows individuals to pursue their desired careers. Graduates have the knowledge and skills necessary to take on challenging roles and make a positive impact in their chosen fields. Additionally, graduates have the opportunity to pursue higher education and earn advanced degrees, which can lead to even more opportunities and higher salaries.  Another reason why graduating from school is important is that it allows individuals to demonstrate their knowledge and skills to potential employers. Employers value graduates because they have the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in their roles. Graduates also have a deeper understanding of the industry they are entering, which can help them make informed decisions and contribute to the success of their organizations.  Furthermore, graduating from school can also provide individuals with a sense of pride and accomplishment. Completing a significant educational journey can be challenging, and graduates have worked hard to achieve their goals. Graduates can also feel a sense of satisfaction in knowing that they have gained the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in their chosen fields.  In conclusion, graduating from school is an important milestone in one's life. It allows individuals to pursue their desired careers, demonstrate their knowledge and skills to potential employers, and gain a sense of pride and accomplishment. Graduates are well-positioned to succeed in their chosen fields and make a positive impact in the world.		1
Working in groups or working alone both have their distinct advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, working in groups can provide support, collaboration, and the potential for great ideas to come out of open discussion. On the other hand, individual work can foster autonomy, a higher degree of creativity, and focus on specific tasks. Ultimately, the decision of which approach to take depends heavily on the individual. Experiences can change an individual's perspective on which approach yields better results. A person who was successful in completing a project on their own might find more solace in individual work, while a person who was part of a successful team project may favor the benefits of working in a group environment.		1
As a high school student, I strongly believe that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. Dress codes create a professional and respectful atmosphere that can improve student behavior and focus on learning.  Firstly, dress codes promote equality and reduce distractions. When all students are dressed in similar attire, it eliminates the pressure to wear expensive or trendy clothing, which can cause financial stress for some families. Additionally, dress codes eliminate the distraction of revealing or inappropriate clothing that can be a distraction to both students and teachers.  Secondly, dress codes prepare students for the professional world. In most workplaces, there are dress codes and expectations for appropriate attire. By implementing dress codes in schools, students learn the importance of dressing appropriately for different settings and situations. This skill will be valuable for their future careers.  Lastly, dress codes can improve school safety. With a dress code in place, it is easier for school administrators and security personnel to identify individuals who do not belong on campus. This can prevent outsiders from entering the school and potentially causing harm to students or staff.  In conclusion, dress codes have numerous benefits for the school environment. They promote equality, prepare students for the professional world, and improve school safety. While some may argue that dress codes limit self-expression, the benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks.		1
Dear Principal,  I am writing to you today to express my opinion on the school's cell phone policy. I believe that Policy 1 is a better option than Policy 2. Here are some reasons why I think so.  Firstly, allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times will make them more responsible. It will teach us to use our phones wisely and not get distracted during class time. We will learn to manage our time better and prioritize our tasks. This will help us in the long run, as we will be better prepared for the real world.  Secondly, having phones at school can be useful in emergency situations. For example, if a student gets lost or needs help, they can easily call their parents or the school authorities. This will ensure the safety and well-being of all students.  Lastly, many students use their phones for educational purposes. They can access online resources, take notes, and use educational apps to enhance their learning. If we are not allowed to have phones at school, we will miss out on these opportunities.  In conclusion, I strongly believe that Policy 1 is a better option than Policy 2. It will make us more responsible, ensure our safety, and provide us with educational opportunities. I hope you will consider my opinion when making your decision.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
 Students often debate whether inactivity or staying occupied is the key to success in life. While some argue that doing nothing leads to achievement, others believe that staying busy is the way to go. However, I believe that staying occupied is the way to go if you want to be successful and achieve your goals in life.  Sitting around and doing nothing will not lead you to anything successful in life. Whether you're at home or at school, finding something productive to do will help you in the future. It doesn't have to be school-related work; it can be anything that keeps you busy and productive, such as having a job, doing chores, or volunteering in the community.  When I was 14-15 years old, I would often sit around and do nothing, which led me to engage in negative behaviors that did not help me achieve my goals. However, now that I'm 17 years old, I make sure to stay busy by doing school work or working my part-time job. This has helped me prepare for my future and achieve my goals.  It's important to note that staying busy doesn't mean you have to be productive all the time. It's okay to take breaks and relax, but it's essential to find a balance between work and leisure activities.  In conclusion, staying occupied is the way to go if you want to be successful and achieve your goals in life. It's important to find something productive to do, whether it's school-related work or anything else that keeps you busy and productive. By staying occupied, you'll be better prepared for your future and achieve your goals.		1
Although some may believe that school projects should be designed by a student it should be known that Teachers should be the project designer. Teachers should be the project designer because teachers have a better chance of making a better and curious project. Not only that but some students dont have the time to work on a project,some have to work, go to sport practice. Teachers should be the project designer because teachers can list all the wed-sites and information you need to complete the project. Students wouldn't have the right tools to be a project designer. Another reason teachers should be the project designer because teachers won't make the project easy. The project is more fun when the teacher make the project more fun and challening. If the teacher as the project designer make the project easy then it won't be hard trying to complete the project. Last for not lease the reason teachers should be the project designer is because the project would be organized. For example the more organized the steps are the more easy it is to complete a project and students designer love rushing when doing things while being destracted and the project is not finished. Some schools require students to complete summer project to assure they continune learning during their break.		0
Dear Principal,  I am writing to express my opinion on the possible policy change that would require students to have at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. As a student in grade 8, I understand the importance of academic success, but I also believe that extracurricular activities play a vital role in shaping our futures.  I argue against requiring a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. Firstly, not all students are academically inclined, and some may struggle to meet the benchmark. This could lead to a situation where students who genuinely enjoy and excel in sports or other activities are excluded, purely based on their academic performance. This could be detrimental to their mental health, as they would be denied the opportunity to engage in activities they are passionate about.  Secondly, extracurricular activities offer a unique opportunity for students to develop their skills and interests outside of the classroom. Sports, for instance, teach teamwork, discipline, and time management, which are essential life skills. By participating in these activities, students learn to balance their academic and personal lives, which is a crucial aspect of their development.  Furthermore, requiring a grade B average could create an environment of stress and competition among students. Students may feel pressured to focus solely on academics, neglecting their extracurricular interests and passions. This could lead to burnout, decreased motivation, and a lack of engagement in school activities altogether.  Lastly, I believe that there are alternative ways to encourage academic success without imposing strict requirements on extracurricular activities. For instance, the school could offer additional tutoring programs, academic support groups, or recognition and rewards for students who demonstrate improvement in their grades.  In conclusion, while I understand the importance of academic success, I firmly believe that requiring a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities is not the solution. Instead, we should focus on creating a well-rounded education system that encourages students to explore their interests, develop their skills, and maintain a healthy balance between academics and extracurricular activities.  Thank you for considering my opinion, and I hope that you will take our views into account when making your decision.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
Hey, so for this essay, I had to research how having enthusiasm can lead to success. And let me tell you, it's a pretty cool topic! Like, think about it, when you're really passionate about something, you're way more likely to put in the effort and work hard to achieve your goals.  So, I looked at some examples of people and organizations that have achieved success with enthusiasm. Like, have you heard of Steve Jobs? He was like, super enthusiastic about his work, and it totally paid off. He co-founded Apple and made it into this huge tech giant. And he didn't just do it by being boring and stuffy. No way! He was always pushing the boundaries and trying new things.  Another example is the band, One Direction. They started out on this reality TV show, and they were so passionate about their music that they worked super hard to make it big. And now they're like, huge! They have millions of fans and they're selling out concerts left and right. It's like, they didn't just get lucky, they worked their butts off to get where they are.  But it's not just individuals, organizations can be enthusiastic too. Like, have you heard of Nike? They're like, this huge sports brand, and they're always pushing the limits of what's possible. They're always coming up with new ideas and innovations, and it's because they're super enthusiastic about what they do. They don't just settle for being good, they want to be the best.  So, what can we learn from all of this? I think the biggest thing is that enthusiasm is key to success. When you're passionate about something, you're way more likely to put in the effort and make it happen. And it's not just about being passionate, it's about being excited and energized too. Like, when you're really enthusiastic about something, you can just feel it, right? It's like, this buzzing energy inside of you that just makes you want to keep going.  So, yeah, enthusiasm is super important for success. And I think that's		1
The electoral college may seem like its a good idea to keep thngs going,but I think America should get rid of it. Alote of people say its unfair. Mostly because of the winner-take-all system. If you were to vote for a presedent, you are in favor, everyone would like thier vote to be counted,right? and it is,but is it really counted towards the presedent we want to get voted for elections?  According to this article, you dont really vote for the presedent you want, what you are really voting on is a state of elector, and if he gets elected he is the one who really gets to vote for the precedent. And that is unfair, I think we should change it to popular vote. We should change it to polular vote because the elecoral college is really unfair to Americas citizens. Also alote of people argue about the winner takes all system because candidates dont spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning. Also it is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  Like I said it is unfair, outdated, and irrational,with all these things I dont think many people would like that .So I think we should change it to popular vote, i think it would be easyier and it would be more fair,and that is what our citizens want. And that is what we should give them. After all its thier vote that counts, so lets let them decide if we should keep it the same with the electoral college or change it to some way better like by popular vote.  so according to all this information I think we should change our way of voting and flip everything around to something fair and effective. We need somthing that would make our vote count. somthing that would be fair to all of our citizens. after all its what we choose then thats what we ned to be happening. only you can prevent unfairness.    		0
The new technology called the "Facial Coding Sytem"is the best technology ever. It has a veriety of features like the 3-D model,the recognizition emotion face,annd the math homework app .  The 3-D model is one way why people should choose this technology because if you have a 3-D model computer then everything looks big and clear. This proves that now and days people like to watch thing and look at things big and clear. So that is why you should take this technology.  The recognize emotion is another reason why this is a nice technology. For example,this shows how you feel or the way you expressions look. The author says,"Using video imagery,the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in real life or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."This proves that the facial emotion can work on anything whether is a person or a picture of someone.  The math homework is the last reason why you should buy this technology. In fact this is also a part of the emotion senser like whether if you feel like doing it or not. For examle,in the text it says,"Hold on! Can we actually calculate emotions-like mathwork."This proves that the technology can tell if we want to do something or not. Emotion in the new technology can really determine a person.  In conclusion,The emotion,homework and 3-D computer are the best features to have on a technology and people would love it too if they had want to get one.		0
 The cowboy who rode the waves was a legendary figure known throughout the Wild West. He was a man of few words, but when he spoke, his words carried weight. He was a man of action, a man of the open range, and a man who loved nothing more than the feeling of the wind in his hair as he rode across the vast American West.  But this cowboy was different from the others. He was not content to stay on the ground and watch the world go by. No, he was a man who wanted to explore the vast oceans that lay just beyond the horizon. And so he set sail, braving the dangerous waters that lay ahead.  At first, the journey was difficult. The cowboy was not a natural seafaring type, and he struggled to adapt to the ways of the ocean. But he was determined, and he persevered. And as he travelled further and further from the shore, he began to feel more at ease. The sound of the waves crashing against the boat was comforting, and the feeling of the wind rushing through his hair was exhilarating.  Eventually, the cowboy found his footing on the open sea. He learned how to read the wind and the currents, and he became a skilled navigator. And as he travelled from one port to the next, he made many friends along the way. He met sailors from all over the world, and he shared stories and music with them under the stars.  But the cowboy was not content to simply travel from one port to the next. He wanted to really explore the ocean, to discover all of its secrets. And so he set out on a journey that took him to some of the most remote and uncharted waters in the world.  He sailed through treacherous currents and battled fierce storms, but he never lost his sense of adventure. And as he travelled further and further from home, he began to realize that the ocean was a place of wonder and mystery, a place that was full of life and beauty.  In the end, the cowboy who rode the waves returned to the shore a changed man. He was no longer just a cowboy, but a true adventurer who had seen the world from a new perspective. And as he looked out over the horizon, he knew that there was still so much more to discover, so many more adventures to be had. He would always be a cowboy at heart, but he would also always be a cowboy who rode the waves.		1
All of our lives, many people have talked about how there would be flying cars in the future.  You see it in countless movies and shows, the most popular probably being Back to the Future.  Unfortanatly, the flying car is yet to be made. However, many companies are working on driverless cars. Cars that you can just get in and they will drive you where ever you need.  As amazing and unbeleiveable as this idea sounds, is it worth the risks?  To be able to make a safe car that runs on its own seems very difficult.  It is not something that can be made overnight.  In fact, Google has made and is still working on driverless cars since 2009.  So, this idea has been around for long enough, but why do we not see any driverless cars on the road today?  No company can seem to make a car smart enough to drive itself.  BMW annouced 3 years ago the development of "Traffic Jam Assistant." This car can drive in speeds up to 25 miles per hour, althought the "not-so-driver" must keep his or her hands on the wheel, and they are alerted when they must take over driving. Meaning that they must pay atttention at all times.  So what is the point of these so called "driverless" cars if they are not completley "driverless"?  This idea can totally change the world. Although, should their really be driverless cars on the roads if they are not COMPLETELY self-driven?  Maybe not.  What if someone isn't paying attention to the road then suddenly the car is put in a situation where it doesn't know what to do, forcing the "driver" to spring into action.  This could be deadly.  Plus, what if people forget how to properly drive after years of a car doing for them? Then when they do need to take over the driving, their driving skills may be rusty, and they defininatly won't know what to do in an advanced situation, such as if the car was skidding and/or going off the road.  Leading to many injurys or even death.  With that being said there are still many injurys and deaths with people opperating cars.  So you may say that the argument is invalid.  Although, you can teach humans to be carful in a car, and yes we make mistakes, but humans, unlike computers, can adapt to complicated situations.  Driverless cars seem very helpful, but is it really worth the risk of death.  Would you really put you saftey into the hands of a computer?  The negative seems to out-weigh the positive.  Not saying that it is an impossible idea, just very unrealistic.  Maybe they should just start working on flying cars instead?		0
 Venus, the second planet from the sun, has long been a subject of fascination and exploration. With its intriguing features and potential to support life, the planet has captured the imagination of scientists, amateur astronomers, and the public alike. In this essay, we will explore Venus and the different ways it has been studied over the years.  The first successful orbiter mission to Venus was the Magellan spacecraft, which launched in 1990 and completed its mission in 1997. During its time in orbit, Magellan studied the planet's surface and discovered that it was covered in massive, dense clouds that could extend up to 190 miles above the surface. This was a surprise to scientists, as they had previously believed that Venus' atmosphere was relatively thin.  In addition to Magellan, other missions to Venus have focused on studying the planet's atmosphere. The Soviet Venera 13 and 16 missions, which launched in 1975 and 1981, respectively, were the first successful landings on Venus. They confirmed that Venus has a thick, dense atmosphere that traps heat and is responsible for the planet's notoriously high surface temperatures, which can reach up to 460 degrees Celsius.  More recent missions to Venus have focused on studying the planet's volcanic activity and geological features. The Venus Express spacecraft, which launched in 2005, is still in operation and has discovered evidence of volcanic activity on the planet, including lava flows and calderas. The spacecraft has also detected signs of seafloor movements, suggesting that Venus may have had a similar dynamic surface to Earth in its past.  In addition to space missions, scientists can study Venus from Earth using telescopes and other equipment to observe the planet's surface and atmospheric features. These observations have provided valuable insights into Venus' geology and composition. For example, researchers have been able to detect signs of large impact craters on the planet's surface, suggesting that it has been hit by meteoroids and comets in the past.  Overall, exploring Venus has greatly expanded our understanding of the planet and its potential to support life. While the planet's surface temperatures and dense atmosphere make it a challenging environment to study, ongoing research and exploration continue to reveal new insights into the mysteries of Venus.		1
Driverless Cars is good way to help a driver when they are tired and they can take a break from the stairing wheel. The good thing about Driveless cars is that they can drive by themself under specific conditions. Google has had driveless cars that have driven more then half a million miles without a crash.  I think it's a good idea to make drivelss cars because it's interesting and this will help people out a lot especially when they are tired of staring the wheel and they need to sit back and relax, but I mean they will still be alerted to take over the wheel when they are dealing with traffic and accidents the care will warn them.  No matter what, theirs always going to be an accident and you can't blame the car for it, accedents happen and it can either be the other person in the other car or you. If you have a driveless car and you are taking a break but you still have the responsibility to stay on tract and have an eye on the road and not be texting it's still dangerous even though if it's a driveless car. Driveless cars can steer, acclerate and brake themselves but they are all designed to notify the driver when its neccasary.  Driveless cars can also help people who don't know how to drive it can help them out if the person is going to fast it can slow them down.  In 2016 Telsa is realeasing a car that is capable of driving outopilot 90% of the time. In 2020 their will be cars like Mercedes, Benz, Audi, and a Nisaan that will be alble to drive by themselves I think have driveless cars is a good idea. 		0
Dear Senator,  The Electoral College is a very unfair to many of the states.Some states are left in the dust without being visited or even seeing anything about a campaign. Also the voting is misleading because they vote for electrols not the president which the people should be voting for.In the passage  The Indenfensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong states  " Under the electoral college system ,voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." this information tells us that Electoral College is wrong and should be changed.  Voting for a new president is left for the electors we choose as a state to pick and we dont even get a say in the matter because we can not control who they vote for and it could be very confusing and people might vote for the wrong person.In the passage  The Indenfensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong states "Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case ,Elections would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president." With this information it shows that the election is out of the people hands that are going to be governed but to the governement that can make very bad decsions and has the United States populations fate in there hands and make the wrong move and have a crisis for the next four years to come.Also the winner take all system doesnt spread eqaully through the states, In the 2nd source it states" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina ,and voter in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." This shows that it doesn't matter that the candidates go to get states because they only depend on certain states that have alot of elctorols like California and Texas an Ohio.  The Electoral College idea is outdated and irrational and needs new ideas that wil make voters happy. It would be easier just to have a popularity vote to pick the president instead of going through so much chaos with all the election. Ther should be campaigns and a couple of debates but then one big election that every one vote on at the same time to elect our president. This idea might help bring togetheir the population in each states to decide on one president to run our nation. The Senate and the House of Represeitatives already have a job and doesn't need to be taking the job of the citizens. To prove my point in passage 2  The  Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the sysem are wrong states "  In 1976 a tie would have occurres if a mere 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted theother way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe" The citizens can be confused and easily mislead if something is confusing like the Electoral College. Swing voters can change everything .  In this type of election there can also can be segregation invovled which unfair because mostly all people in the Senate and The House of Represantives are white and maybe have a problem with different races or women becoming the next president.  In source 2 the last paragraph :  "It's offical: The electoral college is unfair ,outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.And the arguments against elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this but Bob Dole was right:  Abolish the electoral college!"  I agree with this is and I beleive that the Electoral College should be abolished because it is so unfair to the voters because thet are mislead and are not voting for the prsident but for the electors to vote for the president. I hope you agree with my opinion and decide to take this matter in your own hands and make a better election and happy citizens.  Sincerly,  PROPER_NAME           		0
The passages provided discuss the advantages of limiting car usage in different cities around the world. One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to Passage 5, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, these emissions can be reduced, contributing to efforts to combat climate change. Passage 9 also mentions that the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting "car reduced" communities to reduce emissions.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation methods. Passage 4 discusses the concept of "smart planning" in which suburbs are designed to be more compact and accessible to public transportation. This approach encourages people to use public transportation instead of private cars, reducing traffic congestion and promoting a more efficient use of space and resources. Passage 26 talks about a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work. This event promotes alternative modes of transportation and reduces the reliance on cars.  Limiting car usage can also have health benefits. Passage 18 mentions that during the driving ban in Paris due to smog, congestion reduced by 60 percent. This reduction in traffic can lead to improved air quality in cities, which is beneficial for people's respiratory health. Passage 33 suggests that the decrease in car ownership and driving in the United States may have positive implications for carbon emissions and the environment.  Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved quality of life. Passage 3 features a resident of the car-free community in Germany, who expresses being happier without a car. By reducing the dependency on cars, people can enjoy quieter and more peaceful streets with less noise and pollution. Passage 28 describes the improvements made in Bogota, such as the construction of bicycle paths, parks, and sports centers, as well as the replacement of uneven sidewalks. These changes enhance the livability of cities and make them more enjoyable for residents.  In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the promotion of alternative transportation methods, health benefits, and an improved quality of life. By adopting smart planning strategies, encouraging the use of public transportation, and creating car-free spaces, cities can become more sustainable, efficient, and livable.		1
Learning in a classroom setting and in a home setting both have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will compare and contrast these two learning environments to help determine which one is better for students.  One of the biggest advantages of learning in a classroom setting is the opportunity to interact with other students. In a classroom, students are able to collaborate and work together on projects, share ideas, and ask questions. This type of social interaction is essential for students to develop important communication and teamwork skills that will serve them well in the future. Additionally, teachers are able to provide immediate feedback and guidance, which can help students stay on track and improve their understanding of the material.  On the other hand, learning in a home setting allows for more flexibility and personalization. Students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule, which can be especially beneficial for those who have different learning styles or who struggle with traditional classroom settings. Additionally, students can learn in an environment that is most comfortable for them, which can help them feel more relaxed and focused.  However, one of the main disadvantages of learning in a home setting is the lack of social interaction. In a classroom, students are able to interact with their peers and teachers on a daily basis, which can help them develop important social skills. Additionally, home learning can be isolating, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.  Another disadvantage of home learning is the potential for distractions. In a home setting, students may be distracted by family members, pets, or other household activities. This can make it difficult for them to stay focused and on task. In a classroom, however, students are able to minimize distractions and concentrate on their studies.  In conclusion, both classroom learning and home learning have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. While classroom learning provides opportunities for social interaction and immediate feedback, home learning allows for more flexibility and personalization. Ultimately, the best learning environment for a student will depend on their individual needs and preferences.		1
In this article it talked a lot about how maybe schools could use computers to sensor a student's emotion of either getting bored or losing interest and to be able for the computer to change the lesson slightly to get the students attention, But do you think this would really work? In some cases yes it might work for some people, but definetly not everyone. Why? Because some students may have diformaties in their muscles in their face, facial piercings that could afftect they way the computer reads your emotion, or even just simply you face might be showing one expression but you may feel another way.  Not everyone in the world is same so it's really hard to make something like this that would benefit everyone. You also have to think about the cost of these computers, just think normal computers are already expensive, but ones that can read your emotion you can imagaine that those prices would be unbelievable.  As well as every student learns differently, so if the computer changes the way the lesson is being taught based off of your emotion when maybe the lesson is already clear to you, could make it harder on some students. So overall I believe that this product wouldn't be very successful due to a lot of the roadblocks in the way, especially with money involvment. 		0
Students attend school everyday with hundreds of other students around them. The amount of small interactions one student could have with another are countless. Large public gatherings are a recipe for the spread of diseases. There has recently been a rise of concern about the infamous Coronavirus. A solution to prevent the spread of the virus includes, but is not limited to, students attending online school to lower the chances of it spreading quickly. This solution is a well advised decision. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home for many reasons. Firstly, they won't fall behind in classes when they are too ill to be in a public space. Secondly, they can still receive their education when they don't have proper transportation. Lastly, they can still interact with classmates and teachers in an unconventional setting. These are just a few reasons as to why students would benefit from being able to attend classes online.  Cold and flu season comes every year, leaving those who are unfortunate enough to have caught it, unable to attend school for at least a week, or however long a doctor recommends they should stay home. When these students come back to school, they are bombarded with make-up work that needs to be completed as soon as possible. Classes don't stop for students when they take a leave of absence. If students were able to attend online school, they wouldn't have to catch up on work because they would still be able to do it at home with the proper instructions and could still ask for help when needed. Teachers can get sick as well, sudden symptoms can make teachers leave abruptly without assigning work for students or leaving notes for substitutes. This sets students behind and could be prevented if students could attend online classes. Making online school a plausible option would also promote better attendance because students wouldn't have to physically be at school to be marked present.  While having the best intentions, public transit is often unreliable and falls short when needed. School buses can be later than they claim to be, resulting in students waiting outside in harsh weather, buses can come earlier than planned, leaving students deserted, there are times where substitute bus drivers, that aren't familiar with the streets, stray from the route, and even instances where students have to walk long distances to simply reach a bus stop. All of these inconveniences could be easily avoided if students could complete their work from home. Colleges offer online classes for students that are unable to be on campus or students that need flexible schedules. Schools could resemble the same structure college classes have to better adjust to the students.  There are some people who believe that attending school in a conventional setting is essential to students so that they can interact with others and understand topics with face to face lessons, but these things can still be achieved in an online setting. As technology continues to advance, students need to be aware of how to work these tools to be prepared for the work force. Giving students the ability to complete their school work from home is a perfect teaching opportunity and a useful skill to familiarize students with.  With the rise of concern and media coverage for diseases and viruses such as the Coronavirus, schools around the world are considering online schooling for students. This would be a precaution to prevent diseases and viruses from spreading in a large crowd. Students would in fact benefit from being able to attend online classes from home for many reasons. Firstly, they would still receive their education, even when they are at risk for spreading an illness they may have acquired. Secondly, they can still learn when they don't have access to transportation. Lastly, they still attain the people skills learned in the school environment. Schools are becoming more technology based every year, this just might be the next step.		0
In this article i am against the value of using technology to read students emotinal expressions , because most people hate being reminded that they are mad. When looking at a person u can tell if they mad sad or really down , and for technology to do that there is no reason we should have a computer knowing were mad, happy ,or anger .  In article 5 for instance you can probably tell how a freind is feeling simply by the look on there face as the article say. In this community today most people just look mean . As Dr. Huang perdicts most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional coummication . But wen using a fake smile the mouth is streteched sideways . Nobody should use a fake smile just to caculate that they are happy.  The value of using technology to read students shoudlnt be approve , most kids get bored but know alot , but just dont wont to do it most kids shouldnt be read if they dont wont to be read .		0
I agree with the principal that students should have to do one or more extracurricular activites. If students play sports for the sxhool they attend they could have lots of fun with freinds. Also with more people in diffrent clubs and activities the school could raise alot of money for new things inside the school. With every kid in the school doing activties they could all enjoy seeing other freinds strive towards there goals and do many good things. If the whole school plays for one of their sports teams all of the kids in the school would stay active and healthy.  While playing school sports and clubs the school could raise lots of money and would have to do less fundraising. The students that go to the school could have lots of fun while making money for the school beacause people will often bring in large donations. While people give the school money they could buy better equipment for all of the player and clubs. Like new computers,basketballs and even more thats why I think the school should have atleast every student particioate in one club or sport. Also studies say while your having fun or doing something you enjoy the time goes buy quicker. So all of the students wouldnt be stressed about long practices or club meetings because they wont be worrired about having to raise money and do tons of fund raising.  When playing on a sports team or a club you set goals for yourself and when you are in a great environment you will get to those goals thats why every student should do an activity. In the clubs it should be a stress free place where youm get what you need done in the club and dont how to worry about not having time to do your homework. The sports teams would be great for people who want to try new things like soccer,basketball and even track. Lots of students would be excited for all of the upcoming seasons. If students did a year book club some of the donations would go to new cameras and better yearbook designs. If the whole school played a sport it would just make it a healthy school in general.  If the schools yearbook club had good cameras they could take pictures of all of the sports palyer. Lets say if the sports teams won a championship the yeark book club could take a picture and say championship winners. Scince everyone in the school did asport or a club they could have a fun day at school where they paly games with the leftover money from the donations to buy board games water ballons and even movies. The student council could have a vote on a party or a fun day and that's a great way to teach the council how a demorcracy works. I think its a great idea to have everyone do atleast one extracurricular actvite for the school.  In conclusion I agree with the idea of having everyone do an extra activity after school. The students that will be joining the sports teams will stay active while having fun with their freinds. The yearbook club could help out around the svchool and takempictures for the yearbook and bring in lots of money from people who donate money to the school. The student council could have and election for spots on the council like president vice president and more teaches the students how a demorcracy works. So I think its a great idea if every student had to do one or more extracurricular activity for the school. Its would save the school time fundraising time and money so in all i agree and think every school should be like this.		0
The way the author supported his claims were ways of providing examples. He defined his examples in a way to make worth of pursuiting Venus despite its dangers. He did this by comparing them to the actual project of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus."  First off, he explains that Venus is our neighboring planet. Despite of Venus being close to Earth; we don't know much about it. However, later in the article he mentions something interesting that catches most people's eye. He mentions, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." This caught my eye, especially, because it goes with the idea of Venus being an interesting and worthy pursuit to discover and learn from. Despite of Venus having no life and probably not worth to look at. But all of that changes when he states how the conditions actually are.  Furthermore, as said in the question, despite all of the dangers, it will be worth to study Venus. Since we'll be able to know what actually happened long ago. In paragraph three the author states, "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus," also he states, "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit." These are the dangers of Venus. When considering to send some sort of probe or satellite to investigate this planet these are the circumstances we must consider. The way he incoorperates this idea fully just shows how incredible and extreme these conditions are, to even try and land a rover on Venus.  Lastly, in paragraph five the author starts explaining ways to study and investigate Venus without having to worry about its weather extremes. The author explains, "A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way." He shows us that it has even more worth to study Venus. We are now able to study Venus but at a different angle. This ties in with his idea of pursuiting Venus because we have the chance to find out more about it. Even though it is not the best insight of Venus, gives a perfect example that every little detail we learn about Venus is important and nteresting.  Tying all his claims together, he shows us that Venus is worth the danger to pursuit the planet. The way he compared and contrasted with each detail supports his claim strongly. As the author states, "Not easy conditions, but survivable for humas." Meaning it is not going to be easy, but it is definitely possible.		0
Just think of all of the amazing things you could see and experience being a seagoing cowboy. Everyone should become a sea going cowboy. Theese three reasons are why: Everyone would get to see/ go to amazing places, the seagoing cowboys would get to help people in need that were affected by World War ll, and you would get to help care for the animals on board the boat. This essay will explain why everyone should be a seagoing cowboy.  The first reason that everyone should be a seagoing cowboy is because you will get to see/ experience amazing things and places. In the story A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves Luke, the main character, said he went to places like Europe, China, Greece, Venice, Italy, and the Panama Canal! Who would not want to go there?  The second reason everone should become a seagoing cowboy is because the goal of the seagoing cowboys is to help people that have been affected by World War ll. Just think about how much that would mean to the people that the seagoing cowboys are helping and there family. To have lost everything, but the seagoing cowboys helped those people back to a good life.  The third reason everyone should become a sea going cowboy is because they get to take care of the animals. If they need food, someone gives them food. If they need water,someone gives them water. If they get sick or hurt somehow, then someone needs to help get them healed, etc. If the seagoing cowboys are not going to help someone or see something they are on the boat taking care of the animals.  Everyone can/ should become a seagoing cowboy. They should become a sea going cowboy because theese three reasons: they get to see and experience meny amzing places like China, Europe, Greece, Venice, Italy, and the Panama Canal, but those are just a few. They are helping people that were affected by World War ll. They also get to take care of the animals on the boat! Just imagine this life, helping people that were affected by the war, taking care of animals, playing games and experiencing amazing places. What could be better?   		0
 Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are vehicles that can operate without the need for a human driver. They are equipped with a variety of sensors, cameras, and other technologies that allow them to perceive and navigate their surroundings, make decisions in real-time, and operate the vehicle safely.  One of the main advantages of driverless cars is that they can potentially reduce the number of accidents on the roads. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, human error is a contributing factor in approximately 94% of all traffic accidents in the United States. Driverless cars have the potential to eliminate human error and reduce the number of accidents caused by human behavior such as speeding, drunk driving, and distracted driving.  Another advantage of driverless cars is that they can improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. Driverless cars are equipped with sensors and other technologies that can communicate with other vehicles on the road, allowing them to coordinate their movements and reduce the risk of collisions. This can help to reduce the number of accidents and improve the flow of traffic, leading to reduced congestion and shorter commute times.  Driverless cars also have the potential to increase accessibility and mobility for people who are unable to drive, such as those with disabilities or the elderly. With the ability to operate without a human driver, driverless cars can potentially provide these individuals with greater independence and freedom to travel and participate in activities that were previously inaccessible to them.  Despite the many advantages of driverless cars, there are also concerns about their safety and cost. Some experts worry that the technology required to operate these vehicles may be too complex and expensive, making them unavailable to the average person. There are also concerns about the potential for hacking or other cyber attacks that could compromise the safety of the vehicle and its passengers.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to greatly improve road safety, reduce congestion and increase accessibility and mobility. However, it is important that the potential risks and concerns associated with these vehicles are thoroughly considered and addressed, to ensure that they can be built, operated and maintained to the highest standards of safety and reliability.		1
 The statement "You never to be idle, because you can do wonderful things, just need belive a little bit more on yourself and always we need think that sometimes we commit a mistakes, and that's good because the mistakes is how we can learn about that nobody is perfect, no metter if are wrong things or good things, always you learn that the life is not easy, but is not impossible, so don't be scary, the life is a game and you decide if you want to be a winner or a loser." is undeniably true. It is important to remember that mistakes are an inevitable part of life, and they can teach us valuable lessons about ourselves and the world around us.  In fact, making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process. It is through our mistakes that we are able to identify areas where we need to improve and grow. For example, if you are playing a game of football and your team is losing, you may realize that there is a mistake being made by the opposing team. By recognizing this mistake, you can use it to your advantage and potentially win the game. Similarly, if you make a mistake in a project at work, you can use it as an opportunity to learn from your mistake and improve your skills for future projects.  It is also important to remember that mistakes are not necessarily a negative thing. In fact, they can be a positive thing if they are viewed in the right way. By embracing our mistakes and learning from them, we can become stronger and more resilient individuals. We can also use our mistakes as a way to connect with others who have also made mistakes. By sharing our experiences and learning from one another, we can create a sense of community and support.  In conclusion, it is important to remember that mistakes are a natural part of life and can teach us valuable lessons about ourselves and the world around us. By embracing our mistakes and learning from them, we can become stronger and more resilient individuals. So don't be afraid to make mistakes, because they can be a positive thing if viewed in the right way.		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I believe that this change would be more democratic and would ensure that the President is elected by the majority of the people.  The Electoral College is a system that was created in the 18th century to ensure that the smaller states had a voice in the election of the President. However, this system is no longer necessary. Today, we have a much more efficient way to count votes, and there is no reason why the President should not be elected by the majority of the people.  There are several arguments in favor of abolishing the Electoral College. First, it is undemocratic. In the last two presidential elections, the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. This is because the Electoral College gives more power to smaller states. In 2000, George W. Bush won the election despite losing the popular vote to Al Gore by 543,895 votes. In 2016, Donald Trump won the election despite losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes.  Second, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on a small number of "swing states." These are states where the outcome of the election is uncertain. Candidates spend a lot of time and money campaigning in these states, while ignoring the needs of the voters in other states. This is not only unfair, but it also prevents candidates from addressing the issues that matter to the majority of Americans.  Third, the Electoral College is susceptible to fraud. In the 2016 election, there were allegations of voter suppression and voter fraud in a number of states. These allegations have not been proven, but they raise concerns about the integrity of the Electoral College system.  I believe that the best way to ensure that the President is elected by the majority of the people is to abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote. This would be a more democratic and fair system, and it would ensure that the President represents the interests of all Americans.  I urge you to support a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote. Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
 Driverless cars are a popular topic in the automotive industry, and with good reason. The technology has advanced significantly in recent years, making it possible for cars to operate autonomously on the road. In this essay, we  ll take a closer look at driverless cars and explore their potential benefits and drawbacks.  One of the biggest advantages of driverless cars is safety. Traditional cars are a major cause of accidents on the road, often due to human error. With driverless cars, the responsibility for driving falls to a computer, which is able to process information more quickly and accurately than humans. This has the potential to greatly reduce the number of accidents on the road and save thousands of lives each year.  Another benefit of driverless cars is convenience. With autonomous driving, drivers can use their time while on the road to focus on other tasks, such as reading, listening to music or working. This can make commuting a much more enjoyable experience, as drivers can effectively turn their daily commute into a leisure activity. Additionally, it can provide parents with more freedom to travel with their children, without the need to continually monitor them while driving.  While there are many benefits to driverless cars, there are also some potential drawbacks. One major concern is the cost of the technology. Currently, self-driving cars are highly expensive, making them inaccessible to the average driver. As the technology becomes more widespread, it  s likely that prices will go down, but it still remains a significant investment.  There are also concerns about job loss. As driverless cars become more popular, many jobs in the automotive industry, such as taxi and truck driving, could become obsolete. While new jobs may be created in the technology and maintenance of these cars, not everyone may be able to make the transition.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to bring about significant changes to the way we travel. With their focus on safety and convenience, they could revolutionize the way we commute and make our roads safer and more efficient. However, there are also concerns about cost and job loss that must be addressed as the technology becomes more widespread. Ultimately, it  s up to governments and industry leaders to weigh the pros and cons of driverless cars and make a decision that benefits everyone.		1
 Do you agree with the statement "Success is a journey, not a destination"? I believe that this statement is true because success is not a fixed point that can be achieved and then maintained. Rather, it is a continuous process of growth and improvement.  I have experienced this firsthand in my own life. For example, when I first started learning to play the piano, I struggled to keep up with the other students in my class. But instead of giving up, I continued to practice and work on my skills. Over time, I became better and better, and eventually, I was able to perform in a recital.  Similarly, when I started my own business, I faced many challenges and setbacks. But rather than giving up, I continued to work hard and make adjustments as needed. Eventually, my business began to thrive, and I was able to achieve the success that I had been working towards.  I believe that this approach to success is more effective than simply trying to achieve a specific goal and then moving on to the next one. By focusing on the process of growth and improvement, we can develop the skills and resilience needed to achieve success in all areas of our lives.  In conclusion, I believe that the journey to success is more important than the destination itself. By continuing to work hard and learn from our mistakes, we can achieve the success that we desire.		1
Do you want to stay after school everyday for something you dont want to do?  Our principle has decided to make every student take an extracurricular activity.  I have decided to write about why I dont like the idea of extracurricular activities.  I disagree with extracurricular activities because students are tired at the end of the day,students might have somethings to do after school,and the teachers dont want to stay after school everyday.  First, we should not have extracurricular activities because students are tired at the end of the day. For example,students have seven to eight hours a day of school so they are going to be exhausted at the end of school. For instance,students might have had a test and they have to stay after school for an extracurricular activity. students would start to dislike school for making them stay after school for activities they dont want to do. For example, students dont want to stay in school for more than seven or eight hours a day, It's exhausting to have to stay in school for up to nine hours for activities you dont want to do. We should not have to take an extracurricular activity.  Also, students should not have to take an extracurricular activity because students might have somethings to do after school. For example, students might have chores to do around there home, not every student can stay after school everyday. For example, students might have a doctor's appointment after school and they cant stay after school and students have to get a note from there parents saying they have a doctor's appointment. For instance,Students might be on a sports team and they have to go to training or they have a game,what are they going to do then? Students should not have to take an after school activity.  Finally,The students should not be forced to take an extra activity because the teachers dont want to stay after school everyday. For example Teachers have longer hours than the students. Teachers get to school before the students, and leave school after the students and sometimes they even stay after school. Teachers are exhausted after school and the teachers choose to stay after school, they should not have to stay after school everyday. For instance,teachers are going to be cranky at the end of the day because there may be some kids who made the teacher angry or the teacher is just tired at the end of the day either way the teachers should not have to stay after school, only the ones who choose to stay after school should stay. For example,teachers choose to stay after school to grade students work and teacher choose a day or two to stay after school to help the students who need help and if they stayed after school everyday they would not want to stay after school to grade or to help the students with work. Teachers should not have to stay after school everyday.  'If students stayed after school everyday they would not have time to do what they like at home.''  I disagree with extracurricular activities and we should not have to take an extra activity after school because students are tired at the end of the day,students might have somethings to do after school,and teachers dont want to stay after school everyday.  Students should not be forced to take an extracurricular activity because they have seven to eight hours of school a day, they might be on a sports team or have chores,and teachers dont want to stay after school everyday.  Students, we all should convince our principals that we should not have to take an extracurricular activity we already have a lot of things to do at home and at school.    		0
Exploring Venus may be dangerous but very interesting. It is dangerous because Venus is the second planet closest to the sun. So it is really hot in Venus. Venus is sometimes called, "The Evening Star." While Venus is very simple to see from a good distant but a safe point of Earth, it is proved that is very challenging to study more closely. I think studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because we should travel and study more planets to see what else lives beyond us, dangers shouldn't hold us back from meeting the very edges of imagination and innovation, and Venus has value and us humans are curious.  The first reason why we should study Venus is because we should travel and study more planets to see what else lives beyond us. Venus is often referred to as "Earth's twin," because of the size and density. Earth, Venus, and Mars our other plantary neighbors. Venus may be scary to travel too. But people should study Venus first and if they would want to risk their lives to see what is up there and how Venus is, then they could. They could also try making special suits so that you could survive if you go to Venus. In the text it says,"Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours." Well if that is a issue then they need to study Venus more and then make suits that can prevent the heat from coming towards them so they could survive the travel and come back with pictures, information. etc. This is one reason why we should study Venus because it is a worthy pursuit.  The second reason why we should study Venus is because dangers shouldn't hold us back from meeting the very edges of imagination and innovation. They say in the text, "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." Once people hear this type of information, they get scared because they don't want to die from heat. But you got to realize how Venus may look or how interesting it might be. Venus once was a Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was covered largely with oceans and supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Maybe if we study Venus you could find fossils or things that were left there. It use to be beautiful but you never know what was left. In my opinion, astronomers should start investigating and try making suits that prevent heat and things like that so people could travel to Venus and see how it actually looks now and see if they find anything. That is my second reaoson why we should study Venus because it is a worthy pursuit.  The third reason why we should study Venus is because Venus has value and us humans are curious. In the text it states, "Striving t meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally initimidating endeavors." Really, it means most people are scared to travel to Venus because of the heat issues. But really, people are wondering how Venus actually looks. People are going to start making things up about how Venus looks or false information because going to Venus is like a death sentence. That is why astronomers should make heat prevetion and life protection suits so people could travel to Venus and see the values and views and beauty. The travels on Earth shouldn't be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet our thoughts and ideas. This is the third reason why we should study Venus because of the worthy pursuit.  I think studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because we should travel and study more planets to see what else lives beyond us, dangers shouldn't hold us back from meeting the very edges of imagination and innovation, and Venus has value and us humans are curious. Venus seems like a very interesting planet to visit and i would love to see how it actually looks. I hope one days astronomers makes those suits. People would love to see how Venus looks. Even if it is very risky, let's take the risk and try. These are my reasons why we should study Venus because it is a worthy pursuit, even if it is dangerous.                     		0
Who needs a car anyway? that is what causes pollution in the world. driving all the time is not such a good idea. People are getting lazy now a days. What is wrong with walking? I love walking, i can get exercise and have fun because im with my friends. car riding can be extremely dangerous too.  First of all, driving a car could be very dangerous. For example, some people like to drive while texting which could result in a serious accident. Another reason is not paying attention to the other drivers near you. Kids should not be behind the wheel of a car yet. I say that because they do not take as serious as adults. Teens also like to drive fast to show off or have loud music blasting, these are also advantages of limiting car usage. Car accidents would decrease dramatically.  Second of all, cars take up too much gas which takes up a lot of our money, Walking would be super cheap because you do not have to pay to walk. Driving around 247 makes us really lazy. Walking to where we need to go gives us exercise, and quite frankly everyone needs some exercise or a little work out. The goverment will even make more pathways or trails for us to travel on. I understand if you are leaving town for a family vacation or going somewhere that is not walking distance, the city has various types of motor transportation, like city buses, cabs, bikes, and do not forget about our planes.  Third of all, im not saying completely get rid of cars just limit how much you drive. Instead of buying car after car after car carpool with friends. That way you can still get to where you gotta go quickly and lower emissions. People do not drive as much as they used to, i found out by a study that driving decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Lets try to make that 50 percent. People do not really care about a car, they just want a quick way to get from A to B. All we gotta do is Find a safer more cheaper way for them to do that and the percentage will drop rapidly.  In Conclusion, limiting car usage can be improved by getting people to walk more. Carpool with friends, ride bikes, takes buses, cabs, even planes to where they have to go. This will help our enviorment to be much safer and healthier. We not saying give up your car just try not to use it so much.		0
Dear principal,  I think its unfair to mandate community service. Some people think its a great i idea to do community service, but for some people it just takes to much time!  If we had more time on our hand then i would be all for community service, but don't have a lot of time to do anything after school. Our teachers give us too much home work and not enough time to do it all and now if it becomes mandatory to do community service no one will have any time to do anything but homework and community service. That is unfair and unjust taking a way our personal time. Before the only time i had to myself was sleeping, and now i will have to spend that picking up trash. Or reading to the blind. Or tutor elementary school students. Or spending my time with old people that have Alzheimer's disease, who can even remember the last time they went to the bath room. That is a court sentence, not what you do for school.  I understand that what your considering doing is for a good cause. But leave community service to people who want to do it and can do it. Not to people that are being forced to.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
Community service is something that is very important, just giving someone a hand can change their whole perspective on life.  The purpose of community service is to get out and make the world in which we live in a better place for everyone.  Doing something as simple as waving and asking how someone is doing can make someone's day worth while.  You will never know how much you can touch someone's heart with just a simple gesture.  It is important that everyone should do community service because it could have a positive impact on the person that is being helped as well as the person that is helping.  The feeling you get when you help someone with something is the greatest feeling in the world, there is nothing like it.  Helping an older person or being with an older person in a nursing home can be an amazing experience, you can learn about history from a standpoint of someone who was there and lived through it! That is a thing that not everyone gets to do in their life time.  Even being kind to a person that is having a bad day can make their life worth living.  If everyone would just care a little bit about each other you could save lives and the depression rate in our country could change drastically for the better.  Just think about saving someone's life, not everyone can say they have done that.  Our world has changed over the years, neighbors used to talk with each other daily just to see how they are doing, just to say hi, just to care for them.  Now all this country cares about is getting from point A to point B and in the process being rude toward others that are getting in their way.  Just think of how we could change things by just saying, " Hi, how are you?", this country could be the way it used to be.  And it wouldn't even be all that hard to do.  Community service changes lives, that is why it is important that everyone should do it more often then they care for only themselves.		0
Alot of people might think that aliens have lived on Mars and formed a face of an alien artifact on Mars. But I think that the face is just a natural landform.  The reason I think that it was created by a landform is because on JPL web site it showed a clearer photo of the face on Mars. Most landforms are around the American West. So we can look at the landforms around the American West as a guide line to compare photos alot easier. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho, says Garvin. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.  By the looks of it it seems like the Face on Mars looks like it was created by a natural landform on Mars by the looks of the photo graphs.		0
Driverless cars are a good idea, but it has its flaws. Driverless are more prone to get into an accidents than cars with people actually driving them. First, the car is made up of a lot of sensors. The sensor on the roof is the most important one, and if that sensor gets damaged in any way the car couldn't drive itself. If someone was taveling on the road in that car, and the Rotating sensor stopped working then they would have to take over , and drive themselves. Also if a malfunction happened on a highway it can cause car crashes and such. While there are problems about the sensor privacy needs to be addressed too.  Privacy is a big thing too the "Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining foucused on the road" this shows that the manufactureres are watching people as they drive. People in the car would have no privacy cause the manufacturers are watching them. While privacy is a issue buying that can't drive itself is an issue too.  The car still "requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents" this shows that the driver must stay alert while its driving. Manufactueres have developed things to get people's attention whenever a problem occurs. Its like why would you pay for a driverless car that you still have to drive?  Driverless cars should not be sold because there are to many flaws with them from malfunctioning to broken sensors. Its better to have it be human driven than machine driven.    		0
Image yourself siting at your desk doing work all day in all of your classes do you know how boring that would be. well thanks to our principal we dont have to do all of that boring work because he has made the decision that all students must have at least one extracurricular activity on there agenda for the school year.  So far we are the only school to embrace this new idea. Now i know some of you probably dont like sports and enjoy reading and writing and all of the other work we do in class. Yes that work is important but being active is also important. Some of you probably think that your not as good as the rest of the kids so you would not be ably to make the team but you should try anyways because you might surprise your self. There is so many sports in the world so if you dont like one or your not good at one then just try another one. Even if you cant find one you like then you could always just invent a new one. It might even become a huge hit and then that could be your job or you could sell the idea off to some big sports company. If i were going to chose or had to chose a sport in would be either basket ball baseball or football because your mostly active all the time in those sports and your always running around. Well maybe football basketball or baseball is not your thing. Maybe you like golfing swimming or even wrestling.  And those are just the sports i cant believe i havent told you that you could be part of the student council. I dont know much about that kind of stuff so i really cant help you there but i recommend that you join that if your not going to take part in any sports. i assume that its like helping out your town or school or like a nursing home or something like that. Or it could be managing your schools activities and events and meetings. I dont really think that would be that much fun but to some people that might be the time of there life. Alright i cant control what you do but i strongly encourage you to join the student council or participate in a sports group.  In conclusion i strongly agree with this principals decision because some kids do nothing after they get out of school.		0
Education is one of the fundamental pillars of a successful democracy and harmonious society. As such, it is of the utmost importance that America's education system be of the highest quality in order to foster the development of intelligent citizens. With the rapid advancement of new technology has come opportunities for new ways to learn; students can type rather than hand write, access internet databases for information, and work collaboratively online rather than in person, among other advantages. It is easy to believe that all the aspects of technology that have been introduced to schools have positively impacted student performances, but an outlier is online learning. In theory, being able to learn from the comfort of one's own home would benefit students greatly, but in practice, it gives way to lower academic achievement because many students benefit from the classroom environment, and not all students can be entrusted to work honestly from their homes.  It would be a lie to say that online learning does not have its benefits: it can cater to the needs of students who don't have the means or time to go to class full-time. These cases, however, are few and far between. The vast majority of students are perfectly capable of attending all of their classes, and allowing them to do otherwise only detracts from their learning experiences.  Research shows that there are three main types of learners: people who learn visually, audibly, and from experience and movement. At best, online learning caters to the former two, and at worst, it caters to none. Classroom environments are successful because they are flexible in that teachers can alter their teaching styles to best suit the needs of their students. Online classes or video conferences are far less effective because their curriculum is rigid. There is no teacher to allow social interaction and connection with students, but instead a computer with no mind, no heart, and no ability to judge student performance and change its techniques for teaching accordingly. Online learning takes away the opportunity for interaction and engagement in the learning process by making the curriculum seem repetitive and the assignments boring. Students of all three types of learning ability require stimulation from a teacher to remain engaged, but an online classroom setting is not the best way to engage students. They cannot, for example, stand and move in a certain way to demonstrate a concept, or have an in-person discussion. The ability to actively participate in education is vital, and online learning all but removes it.  The lack of a classroom setting or teacher can take away students' motivation to learn and can lead to habits that rely on cheating as a means of passing a class. The lack of a teacher's presence removes the student's feeling of accountability and students often do not put in the effort to learn the class material. Online courses enable students to take tests and quizzes from home, but many cheat or plagiarize material from the internet rather than doing their work honestly. In fact, the issue had become so rampant that when students take an in-person end-of-semester exam in Generic_School, if they score significantly lower than they did on their at-home tests, they are believed to have been cheating the entire year and are required to resume the class in school rather than online. This goes to show that this is not an isolated issue; it is widespread and supremely damaging to students' grades, work ethic, and potentially even their academic transcripts.  Enabling the use of online classes detracts from students' learning experiences and academic success. A class taken online is one not fully engaged in by students. It is educators' responsibility, however, rather than students, to ensure that dishonest conduct does not take place and that students are engaged in their learning. The best way to ensure these things is to demand that learning take place in a school rather than through the internet. 		0
 The facial action coding system (FACS) is a well-known and widely used tool in psychology that helps researchers study and analyze human emotions through the observation of facial expressions. Developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in the 1970s, FACS is a systematic and objective method for coding facial movements into distinct action units (AUs). The system has since been refined and expanded upon, and has become an essential tool in the field of emotion research.  The FACS system involves identifying and coding six basic primary emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust), as well as a neutral expression. Each of these emotions can be broken down into a series of distinct facial movements and actions, which are then coded into action units. For example, the happiness expression can be coded into several different AU, including the "smile", "laugh", and "blink" actions.  Using FACS, researchers can code facial expressions with a high level of accuracy and consistency. This can be especially useful in studies that seek to compare patterns of facial expressions across participants or between different emotional states. By coding facial expressions into distinct action units, researchers can also more easily analyze the underlying mechanisms that drive emotional expression, allowing them to identify similarities and differences in the way people express emotions across different situations.  The FACS system has been extensively used in a variety of research fields, from psychology and neuroscience to medicine and marketing. In psychology, FACS has been used to study the effects of stress, trauma, and other emotional distress on facial expression. It has also been used to investigate the neural mechanisms that underlie emotional expression, by comparing the facial expressions of neurological patients with those of healthy individuals.  In marketing and advertising, FACS has been used to study consumer behavior and the effects of different advertising campaigns on emotional response. By analyzing facial expressions in response to various advertisements, researchers can gain valuable insights into the emotional impact of different marketing strategies or ad placements.  Overall, the facial action coding system is a powerful tool for studying and analyzing human emotions through the observation of facial expressions. By providing a systematic and objective method for coding facial movements into distinct action units, FACS allows researchers to more accurately and consistently analyze emotional expression, and to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms that drive emotional expression. Whether used in psychology, neuroscience, medicine, or marketing, the FACS system remains a valuable and widely used tool in the field of emotion research.		1
Everyone has different opinions. These opinions are important when it comes to seeking advice. People tend to ask multiple people on what they should do in a certain situation. Seeking different advice and opinions can help a lot because, first of all, the more opinions you have the more open-minded you could be on the situation. Secondly, it helps make a better and safer decision. Lastly, sometimes the advice teaches you a life lesson. When people seek for advice they usually ask more than one person, and its great because different opinions influence your view on the situation, help keep and open mind about the situation, and learn a lesson .  Having a clear view of a siutation is very helpful, thats why people usualy ask for more than one opinion. A clear view of a situation helps influence your point of view and descision. For example, a girl and her best friend got into a fight, and she went to go and seek advice from her other friends on what to do, some said to ignore him, but the others said that she should consider giving some space because he could be stressed about something and that maybe she could bring him a gift. She listened to her friends, and decided to make him a gift and give him some space unless he needs help. A few days later, he got her a gift and apologized and they both made up. See if she didnt ask for advice from others, she could have lost her best friend, or make up a few months later.  Being open minded doesnt only make you a better person, but it also helps make better descisions. Seeking advice from diffrent people, does help keep and open mind. For example, a girl's boyfriend has been acting distance lately, so she went and seeked advice from her and his friends. The girl's friends assumed he was cheating, but the guy's friends told her to be patient, and that hes perfectly fine. She decided to listen her boyfriend's friends. About a week later, he proposed to her, turns out he was surprising her and staying distance because he was scared he might tell her by accident. The girl's friends jumped to assumptions, and so if she hadnt asked the boyfriend's friends, things could have been diffuclt.  Believe it or not, advices from multiple people, could help you learn a lesson. Just like the last two stories, they all learned something. One of the girls learned to not jump to assumption and be patient, and the other learned to be more open minded about what people might be going through. There is also this story Im sure you heard of it, its called Slow and Steady wins the race by Aseop. It was a story about a rabbit and a turtle, the rabbit was fast and always sure that he would win, he was also selfish. One day the rabbit challenged the turtle onto a race, and the turtle agreed. It was the day of the race, the rabbit was already half way while the turtle was all the way behind because he is slow. So then the rabbit decided to take a nap, which gave the turtle time to win. At the end the turtle won, while the rabbit was alsepp, the rabbit was mad. That day the rabbit learned that slow and steady wins the race.  When people seek advice, they usualy go to multiple people, and that is probably because it helps influence your point of view on the situation, keep an open mind, and learn something.                        		0
I say we should keep the Electoral collage. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress & election of the president by popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral Collage consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Under the 23rd amedment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors & treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral Collage. But what's wrong w/ the Electoral Collage, under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for a president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. But in defense of the electoral collage: 5 reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the persident.1)  CERTAINTY OF OUTCOME  -A dispute over the outcome of an electoral collage vore is possible-it happend in 2000-but it's less likey than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning canidate's share of the electoral collage invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.2)  EVERYONE'S PRESIDENT  -The electoral collage requires a presidental canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region(south,northeast,etc.) Has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pularity in states that he knows he will win. This is a desriable result because a canidate w/ only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.3)  SWING STATES  -The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates-as we saw in [2012's] election-to focus thier campagin efforts on the toss-up states....Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attation to he campagin-to really listen to the competing canidates-knowing that thet are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (& for futher reason that thwy will have received the most information & attention from the canidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.4)  BIG STATES  -The electoral collage restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-appotionment of the senate decreed in the constituion....The popular vote was very close in florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by rhe same margin in wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things be equal, a large state gets more attention from presidntial candidates in as campagin than small sate does....5)  AVOID RUN-OFF ELECTIONS  -The electoral collage avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recives a majority of the votes casts. For example, Nixon in 1968 & Clinton in 1992 bath had only 43% pularity of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral collage (301 & 370 electoral votes,respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes casts; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by electoral collage, which invariably produces a clear winner....It can be argued that the electoral collage method of selecting the presindent may turn off potential voters voters for a canidate who has no hope for carrying their state-democrats in texas,for example,or republicans in california. Knowing thier vote will have no effect,they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. But thats why i believe we should stay w/ the electoral collage because we have used this method for so long & yes there were a few hiccups here & there but not every system we use is perfect & for how long we've bee using this one i say why change now!?    		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME  I believe that requiring us to have community service is a good idea. One of my reasons for thinking this is a good idea is because its teaching us kids how not just help people in our friends group or at home but reaching out to our community. If kids didn't want to do community service or in better words not help people then we could show them that its not only helping other individuals but its helping ourselves I remember when my brother was in high school and he had to have a certain amount of community service hours one thing he did was help at the salvation army and i remember him coming home and telling my mom and dad thank you for all the things they do for him and buy him and let him do things. At first I didn't really understand what was going on but now that I it changed him, it opened his eyes to a new era i guess you could say it showed him that he doesn't always need to think of himself but he needs to think of other people as well.  Another reason I think community service should be required is because it shows people that younger students care. Whenever I go and stay the night at my Grandmas i always help her clean and do the laundry etc... but what I'm saying is that she likes that i will help her when she needs it, and I have a good attitude about it. I make this statement because what if one of the jobs we do is helping people and we go to an assisted living home we help people there and it shows them that we care for them and that we haven't forgot them.  My last reason is that its getting us ready for the real world. When we grow up we will have to help people in every day situation whether its at our jobs or even at a store we always are helping people and doing things for people if you require us to have community service I believe that it would let people see in a new perspective, so my position on this statement is to require the performance of community service.		0
Dear Principal,  I am writing you this letter to tell you my opinion on the new rule for sports. I think that having to have a B average to participate in a sport is unnecessary. Many students work hard to get a C average and are interested in playing sports. The idea that you need a B average to play a sport is wrong. There are many students are interested in playing sports in the school and having a C average is sometimes very difficult. If you change the average for the sports there will be much less people on the teams because of the fact that a B average is pretty difficult to obtain when you have to think about so many things on your mind at once. The responsibilities of being a higher level student are getting more in depth and as a student you cant have to worry about trying to keep and above B average and being a good teammate. You will also be loosing many students who for some reason cant keep a B average and may have problems at home or maybe even in school. So that certain persons grades may be falling a little short and they cant think straight. But then if they have to worry about keeping their grades up and other problems that they may encounter as a teenager would just be too much on their mind. There may be more troubles with parents also. If a student is very excited to start to play a sport but doesn't have the required grades then it would be sad for them to have to be let down by the school after being so enthusiastic about starting that sport. So it is a bad idea to bring up the required grade average to a B instead of a C. I hope you take this to mind for it is a very sought after subject that shouldn't be changed.  Sincerely,  Student		0
Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break . Should these summer projects be teacher designed or student designed ? These choices should be up to the students designe . If the student picks they will be more willing to do it . Much rather if the teacher designed the project for the students . They will learn more picking their own designe and enjoy it more if it is their own design . Some kids also may be limited when it comes to acess and supplies and might not be able to get ahold of the supplies they need for the project or things they will need for the project their teacher designed.  With having students designe their own projects instead of the teacher will make the project more enjoyable. Some students will dilike what their teacher has provided them with . This being said it wont be enjoyable and will most likley they wont do it or wont learn anything because they wont be doing it or paying attention to what they are doing. If they dont do it or pay attention to it they wont get the learning experience the teachers want and with it being summer time they will probaly dislike their summer as well. If they dont learn anything there was no point of giving them the project . It should be enjoyable for them so they can have a fun leanring experiance and also have something fun to do over the summer and it being their choice it might make things extra fun for them . If they get to pick it they will proably be happy to be told they have a project to do over the summer and it being vacation they could also come up with something alot more funnier and a better learning experiance then a teacher could.  If the teacher designes the project the students may or may not have supplies for that project . They might not have it because they arent at home or on vacation because its summer time or maybe just might not be able to afford the supplies needed for the project. If the student can designe their project for them selfs they will most likly pick a project they can afford the supplies for or can get . Also saying the fact its summer time you could pick a project to challge yourself because you might be in a diffrent place . Some projects the students could designe could be no money for them at alll and still a good learning experience that was fun for them and not having to pay any money could help out the students who cant afford a project a teacher may have designed .  For example some parents and teachers say alllowing the students to design their own project is care less and they will make horrible choices. However allowing students to design their own projects will allow them to challege themselfes . They will also probley pick a project that is enjoybal to them and will make the learning experiance so much better and the students will most likely complte a project they ejoy doing. Also allowing students to design their own project wont make them be careless it will allow them to make adult choices on their own . This being said will show how much they are growing up and how they can make good choices on their own and how they can do it by themselfs . Allowing them to pick it will mostlikly make them make better choices much rather then carless ones .  The design of what project the students are given in the summer should completly be their own design not the teachers. If the students design their own projects they will mostlikley do something they like . If they do something that they like they will get it done and the learning experiance will be so much better then if the teacher designed what the students where told to do over the summer . It being said if the students where able to design the project they would enjoy it and be able to get all supplies they need for it because the teacher might pick something the student might not like or something they cant get supplies for. They would also probaly love to be told they have a project to do over the summer if it was their design and get it done. So overall students should be allowed to design their own projects so they can learn more in the summer. 		0
Providing students with the option to complete high school in three years instead of four has both potential benefits and drawbacks. The primary motivation for this type of program is to give students an academic head start on college or vocational school. This means that any student who enters the program with the necessary qualifications and dedication would have the potential to graduate from college faster than their peers. On the other hand, students may find themselves unprepared for the speed at which they complete their education and may have difficulty keeping up with the intensity of the program. Another potential disadvantage is that the 3-year program limits students ?opportunities to explore multiple subject areas and discover their interests. Many students may miss out on learning experiences that would shape their further education or life paths if they were to stay in school for the full four years.		1
 School Lunch Menu  It is a common belief that changing the school lunch menu is a bad idea. However, I believe that it is a good idea to change the school lunch menu. Students are the only ones who can decide what they want to eat. Students may prefer a hamburger over a salad, but they may also have dietary restrictions or preferences that need to be taken into consideration.  One of the main reasons why changing the school lunch menu is a good idea is that it can help students with dietary restrictions. For example, some students may be allergic to certain types of vegetables, such as tomatoes or lettuce. If the school lunch menu changes, it can help ensure that these students have access to foods that they can eat without risking an allergic reaction. Additionally, if the school lunch menu includes more options for vegetarians or vegans, it can help accommodate students who follow these diets.  Another reason why changing the school lunch menu is a good idea is that it can help students make healthier choices. Many students may not be aware of the nutritional content of the foods they are eating, and changing the lunch menu can help them make more informed choices. For example, if the school lunch menu includes more options for fruits and vegetables, it can encourage students to eat more of these foods and make healthier choices overall.  Some students may argue that changing the school lunch menu is a bad idea because they may not like the new options. However, it is important to remember that students have the right to make their own food choices. If they do not like the new options, they can always bring their own lunch or choose to eat something else.  In conclusion, changing the school lunch menu is a good idea because it can help students with dietary restrictions, make healthier choices, and give students the freedom to make their own food choices. While some students may not like the new options, it is important to remember that they have the right to make their own decisions. Overall, changing the school lunch menu can be a positive change for students and the school community.		1
The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  Cars have become an integral part of suburban life, but there are increasing efforts to limit their usage. This movement, known as "smart planning", aims to promote alternative transportation methods and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By limiting car usage, suburbs can become more compact, accessible to public transportation, and environmentally friendly. There are several advantages to limiting car usage, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased accessibility to public transportation.  One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in suburban areas, these emissions can be significantly decreased. This is crucial in the fight against climate change and the protection of the environment.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is improved air quality. Car emissions contribute to air pollution, which can have detrimental effects on human health. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in densely populated areas, the air quality can be improved, leading to better health outcomes for residents. This is particularly important in cities like Paris, where smog levels can rival those of heavily polluted cities like Beijing.  Furthermore, limiting car usage can increase accessibility to public transportation. In suburbs that are designed with smart planning principles, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. This encourages residents to use public transportation, walk, or bike instead of relying on cars for daily activities. By making public transportation more accessible and convenient, more people will be encouraged to use it, reducing the reliance on cars and alleviating traffic congestion.  In addition to these advantages, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. The construction and maintenance of roads, highways, and parking spaces are costly endeavors. By reducing the number of cars on the road, there will be less need for these infrastructure investments. This can free up resources to be invested in other areas such as public transportation, education, and healthcare.  In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage in suburban areas. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, increasing accessibility to public transportation, and saving economic resources, the limitations on car usage can have a positive impact on the environment, public health, and the overall quality of life. It is crucial for communities and governments to embrace smart planning principles and promote alternative transportation methods to create a more sustainable future.		1
Dear State Senator,  I believe that the Electoral College should be kept and not changed. With the Electoral College, the presidential candidates can not have trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College also reduces the risk of a run-off election, where no candidate wins a majority of the votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral college vote is also less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This system also encourages voters in toss-up states to be more thoughtful with their vote. The Electoral college also helps in balancing out the weight that large states with a large population lose.  With the Electoral College, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This not only makes the votes more fair, but it also encourages the presidential candidate to be desirable to all regions, not just one that that the candidate knows will vote for him. A candidate with only regional apeal would likely cause residents of the other regions to feel that their votes do not count.  The Electoral College reduces the risk that no candidate wins a majority of the votes and instead, usually produces a clear winner. An example of this, as stated by Richard Posner in his arguement in defending the Electoral college, is when Nixon and Clinton were elected. Both had only 43 percent plurality of popular votes, while winnning a majority in the Electoral College. The Electoral College also avoids creating pressure when no candidate wins a majority of the votes.  As said by Posner, voters in toss-up states who know they are going to decide the election are likely to pay close attention to the campaign and will be more thoughtful with their vote. They also will have received the most information and attention from the candidates. It also makes sense that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.  The weight in the political balance that large states with a large population lose is blanced by the Electoral College. An example ,given by Posner, is that the popular vote in Florida was very close in 2012, but Obama, who won the vote, got 29 electoral votes. The same margin in a smaller state would result in the winner getting alot less votes. This causes large states to get more sttention from candidates than a small state does.  In coclusion, I would like to say that keeping the Electoral College is a great choice. It will make presidential elections more fair and balanced than purely relying on a popular vote. The Electoral College produces more thoughtful votes, which inturn will result in the best candidate for the people to have as president.                       		0
  Dear [State Senator],  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. While some argue that the system is outdated and unfair, I believe it is still an effective and necessary part of our democratic process.  One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a more accurate reflection of the popular vote. As Bradford Plumer notes in his article "The Indefensible Electoral College," the winner-take-all system used in most states means that a candidate can win the presidency with a minority of the popular vote. The Electoral College, on the other hand, requires a candidate to receive a majority of the electoral votes to win the presidency, which is more likely to align with the popular vote. This is particularly important in cases where a candidate receives a large majority of the vote in a particular state, but a smaller plurality in other states.  Another argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign in a wider range of states. As Judge Richard A. Posner notes in his article "In Defense of the Electoral College," the winner-take-all system used in most states means that candidates have little incentive to campaign heavily in states where they are likely to win. However, the Electoral College system requires candidates to campaign in a wider range of states in order to win the presidency. This leads to a more competitive campaign and more attention being paid to the needs and concerns of voters in different states.  Some argue that the Electoral College is unfair because it gives more weight to the votes of citizens in certain states. However, as Posner notes, the Electoral College system restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose due to the mal-		1
In this article i will show you how we shouldn't let danger and doubts get in the way of what we should go do and research. We can study venus even with the danger that we might get hurt or injured but that will have to be tested. That is why we have technology so we can explore these type of things without geting hurt or injured. He or she whoever wrote this article agrees heavily that e should explore more crazy places that we haven't been. We jus cirling around earth finding the same things when we can goto another planet and figure all about the life that used to live there or already does. In the article it says"Our travels on earth and beyond should not be lmited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation". This shows that we should stop being scared go explore more stuff and be advetures courages something differnt.		0
"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor" I mean teacher need to know when his students is not in the mood to do stuff and when they are having a bad time." a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.  computer is very important now in this 21s no matter what you doing you need a computer to do it. computer is like life now you seen technology everywhere where that come from? and their have different kind of computer though some computer have the ability to recognize the sebtlet facial movement and can read our mind, our feelings we express, they even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced smile.  I don't have enough imformation to tell you where this technology come from? we have different kind of technology, like computer, phone, etc. those are some technologies that really important to human.  computer we seen computer everywhere at school, at work, at home, computer is everywhere this technology is very important to human we can go to the internet on computer to do search everything and knows what going on in this earth. We have new computer software that have some abilities to do thing, like read your mind phone is the kind of technology that really important to human. phone been used for the first time in 20s by somewho i don't remember his name but that not the since the point. but with that phone we can connect to others no matter where they are no matter how far are they we seen phone everywhere though  In conclusion computer is kind of technology that really important to human imagine computer replace human or read your mind, your future, control your body but that not the since the point this new software is very important, like it's can tell you when people is having a good time on the internet, or see how people feelings when they are doing something and tell you when people give you a fake smile in life they have some people who are give you fake smile straigh up to your face but do you think we really need this software? to tell us what peole think or feelings.                                                                                                                                                                                                            		0
 Introduction:  Venus, known as the Earth's sister planet, has long puzzled scientists due to its dense atmosphere and extreme temperatures. The planet lacks an adequate atmosphere, making it impossible to land on its surface directly. However, despite these challenges, studying Venus can provide a wealth of knowledge about the conditions that could have led to the development of life on Earth. In this essay, we will explore how well the author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it poses.  Body:  The author, Sarah Noble, argues that studying Venus is a worthy endeavor, even though it comes with significant risks. She notes that Venus's study can provide valuable insights into the potential habitability of other planets in our solar system and beyond. The author argues that studying Venus could help astronomers to understand how the planet's extreme conditions came about, and also provide key insights into the potential for life beyond Earth.  The evidence in the article supports the author's claim. For example, the article cites several missions to Venus, including Magellan, which successfully mapped the planet's surface. Despite numerous technical challenges, Venus was successfully mapped with a 25,000-fold difference in resolution during Magellan's nine-year duration. The author also notes that these missions have helped to uncover important details about the planet's atmosphere, including the presence of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid.  Conclusion:  In conclusion, the author effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the significant risks involved. The evidence cited in the article, such as the successful mapping of the planet's surface and study of its atmosphere, provides a wealth of information that can help scientists to better understand the conditions that could have led to the development of life on Earth. Further study of Venus has the potential to provide valuable insights into other planets' habitability, making it a crucial pursuit for future generations.		1
Hey there!  For this assignment, I researched the effects of having a positive and negative attitude on one's life. It's pretty cool how much of a difference it can make! 🤯  Having a positive attitude can do wonders for your life. For starters, it can make you happier and more optimistic. When you're positive, you're more likely to see the good in things and people, which can lead to stronger relationships and a more fulfilling life. Plus, a positive attitude can help you handle stress and challenges better. You're more likely to bounce back from setbacks and keep pushing forward. 💪  On the other hand, having a negative attitude can hold you back in so many ways. It can make you feel sad, anxious, and unmotivated. You might find yourself focusing on the bad things in life and missing out on all the good stuff. And when things get tough, a negative attitude can make it even harder to deal with. 😔  But here's the thing: having a positive attitude doesn't mean everything will always be sunshine and rainbows. It's okay to have bad days and face challenges. The important thing is to keep things in perspective and not let negative thoughts take over. When you have a positive attitude, you're more likely to find a way to solve problems and come out stronger on the other side. 💪  For example, let's say you want to get good grades in school. If you have a positive attitude, you're more likely to put in the effort and stay motivated. You might even find ways to make learning fun! But if you have a negative attitude, you might get discouraged and give up before you even try. 📚  So, it's super important to maintain a positive attitude in life. It can help you achieve your goals and make your life happier and more fulfilling. Plus, it's just way more fun to be around people who are positive and happy! 😊  In conclusion, having a positive attitude can make a huge difference in your life. It can help you handle challenges better, make you happier, and even help		1
By leveraging advancements in technology, communication, family time, and job responsibilities can each be significantly improved. Communication can be enhanced by virtual collaboration tools, making it simpler for distributed teammates to work together on tasks and projects. Family time can be bolstered by video conferencing, so loved ones that are far away can still spend time together; online gaming and streaming services can also help bring distant family and friends closer. And job-related tasks can be simplified through automation and artificial intelligence, freeing up time in the work day for more meaningful activities. Technology has the potential to really make a positive impact in all these areas of our lives.		1
While cell phones have become an integral part of modern life, they can create serious safety issues when used while driving. For this reason, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity when operating a vehicle.  There are several reasons cell phone use by drivers should be prohibited. First and foremost is the danger of distracted driving. When talking or texting on a phone, a driver's attention is split between operating the vehicle and the phone conversation or texts. Numerous studies have shown that even hands-free phone use can be distracting. This puts not only the driver at risk, but also endangers other motorists and pedestrians sharing the road.  Distracted driving from cell phone use has been linked to an alarming number of car accidents. According to the National Safety Council, over 25% of all car crashes involve cell phone use. Texting while driving in particular makes an accident over 20 times more likely. With so much at stake, it is simply not worth the risk to allow any kind of cell phone function behind the wheel.  In addition, cell phone conversations may slow a driver's reaction time. Having to focus attention on a phone call rather than the road ahead delays the processing of visual and audio cues needed for safe motor vehicle operation. A two-second delay in braking or steering could mean the difference between a near miss and a serious accident.   Many developed nations and states within the U.S. already ban handheld and hand-free cell phone use for drivers. The research clearly shows prohibiting any cell phone function for drivers is the prudent choice to enhance roadway safety. With human lives on the line each time someone gets behind the wheel, the small sacrifice of not using a phone is well worth reducing preventable accidents. For the protection of all people who share the roads, drivers must be fully focused on their primary responsibility - operating their vehicles safely.		1
"So, what you're trying to tell me, is that out of some kinda coincidence, the face was truly just an illusion due to the shadows?" the man asked. "I'm not buying it."  "Yes," I replied, "and I'm about to show you why I'm right."  The man momentarily snickered and went on to say, "I'm all ears."  The face on Mars has long been debated about whether or not it was pure coincidence, or truly an alien landmark that could spark the truth of whether or not aliens truly may exist on planet Mars. Today, I (Nasa Operative) am going to confirm this coincidence simply as nothing more than Martian terrain with a perfect and unusual casting of shadows to create the illusion, along with the help of the article, "Unmasking the Face on Mars".  To begin, as of the past, technology was not very advanced when the first glance at the face was looked at. As of then, the picture was more blurry, and an illusion was casted. These two go hand in hand, as it makes the landscape look more like a face. However, the recent pictures withold better, sharper, and newer quality in which were taken at different angles and lighting, have proven that the "face" was nothing more than Martian landscape. I know this because, "Malin's team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. 'As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, ' he added.' 'So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'  What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West."  Furthermore, this set of information proves the theory of an alien artifact wrong. Although many still believe the artifact and that it regeardless may be true life is on Mars, the face is irrelevant to an alien theory and has been debriefed as no more than part of a Martian messa.  "Whatever, geek! You're just saying this stuff to put it in my head!" angrily defended the man.  "The facts don't lie, my friend," I replied, "there may or may not be life on Mars, but there certainly isn't a face."   		0
 As a student in the education field, I understand that Music, Drama, and Art classes are not mandatory to take. However, these classes can be taken as electives for students who wish to pursue them as a hobby or to gain extra credit. For example, a student who enjoys painting may choose to take an art class, even though it is not a required course.  It is important to note that while these classes can be taken as electives, they should not be considered as necessary for graduation. Instead, students should focus on taking the required classes that are necessary for graduation, such as English 11, Geometry, Math, CIS, and World History. Each of these subjects has its own SOL test, which is an important part of the required classes that students must pass in order to receive school credit and a better score for graduation.  While some educators may choose to offer Music or Drama classes as electives for seniors with fewer classes, these should still be considered as choices and not as required classes. Junior students can also take these electives to gain extra credit.  In conclusion, while Music, Drama, and Art classes can be taken as electives, they should not be considered as necessary for graduation. Instead, students should focus on taking the required classes that are necessary for graduation and passing the SOL tests associated with each subject.		1
Over the past years massive car usage has increased bringing multiple determents. Today fellow citzens should relize the harm to the world brought ,by upgrowing car usage. The advantages of limiting car usage is a benfit promoting communities that,are less dependent on cars,and can be a improvement in air pollution cosequences. The advantages to begin limiting car usage can have many benificial effects in the worldwide .  Innitialy , the advantages of limiting car usage is a benifit due to the fact that communities will be less dependent on cars. In source 3 pargraph 28 the author explains an example of a benifit of limited car usage stating "uneven, pitted side walks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush -hour restrictions have dramaticly cut traffic ; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have croped up." this shows how human beings are using cars less by walking increasing some health issues ,creating less traffic accidents and increasing the economy by shoping with the money they have saved from not using cars so constantly. There are many other bennifits such as in source 3 in paragraph 28 proving how "parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city. " This means by when the author says " bloomed " through out the city explains how individuals of all ages are starting to enjoy the outside activities especially in parks and sports centers making it over populated with people . This gives individuals the advantage to go out exploring new people and challenges decreasing issues in the world such as obesity, self confidence , and a healty status .Although car usage can be a neccesity while on the other hand as a fact that decreasing car usage can only bring bennifits as the ones in the world shown today .This solution could be the start to a numerous amount of oppurtunities that can benifit not only in one way but manny.  moreover, the advantages of limiting car usage can be a improvement in air pollution consequences. The issues of harmful gases from cars on the run has affected issues and consequences as global warming from excessive amounts of air pollution. In source 4 paragraph 29 the author explains an advantage of less car usage for global warming by stating " president obama's ambitious goals to curb the united states 'greenhouse gas emissions , uneveiled last week ,will get a furtuitous assist from an incipient shift in america behavior ; recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars , driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by ." this explains how the decrease of car usage has protected the ozone layer from harmful gases from car gas, fuel, and chemicals making the issue of global warning to bennifical rates at some points . As a fact using cars may bennifit exucess for weariness and body pain although worldwide limiting car usage up to now with these improvements has only bennefit for a better place to breath air that is growing to being less harmful and a cleaner enviorment to live by decreasing newborn bacterias that can harm us. improving global warming is something we all bennifit from either now or later.  to sum up over the past years massasive car usage has been a determent worlwide. today there are issues procceding to the awarness of individuals of upgrowing car usage. limiting car usage bring advantaes such as peaople that can become less depent on cars and decreasing air pollution .this issue is the matter to all of us.         		0
My first impression of someone may not be particularly accurate. Societal norms and expectations, personal biases, or even the way someone is dressed can all affect our initial opinion. It is impossible to get a full perspective of someone’s character, personality, or values just by first impressions. People can be much more complex than we give them credit for, and sometimes it takes a second, or even a third, look to get a better idea of who they are.   Although first impressions can be helpful in some situations, forming too strong of an opinion or judgement based off of minimal information can be hazardous. People should take their own time in getting to know someone's decency, intelligence, and overall character before assuming they shaped the complete, accurate picture.   Overall, it is a mistake to think that our first impressions are the most important when getting to know somebody. We should leave room for change, understanding, and growth in getting to know someone, and not rely solely on surface-level features.		1
Technology and human emotion  From now, human can say we are have most feeling in the world, We can be sad we can be happy, we can be angry about something we can also say'' what's a pity'' but how to show us emotion? Use our face! someone said, how to know somebody emotion? Use our eyes! Somebody day again, but do you know that now we have now the number of you emotion.  What's will like? For example one of most famouse art Mona Lisa, one lady always have a secret smille, she is 83 happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. So amazing right? When I saw the result maybe because of that Mona lisa have beautiful of time. Complate emotion very easy to touch people's heart. this software is form University of lllinois , they hope developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. How it work? The process begins with 3-D computer model easy to say just build a modle of the face and cumputer will calute the way muscles move and he can know the percent of your emotions, depend on each musclesthe cpmputer will know how ''happy'' you was.  So this prosses sound like cool but it just show how much computer can do it not meaing it 100 right. 		0
Developing one's own talents and skills is essential for personal growth and success. It is important to believe in oneself and have appreciation for what one can do. In this essay, I will explain the importance of developing one's own talents and skills and how it can improve one's life.  Firstly, developing one's own talents and skills allows for personal growth. When we focus on what we are good at, we are able to improve and develop those skills further. This process of self-improvement can lead to a greater sense of self-awareness and confidence. For example, when I started taking dance classes, I was nervous and unsure of myself. However, as I continued to practice and improve, I gained a greater sense of self-assuredness and pride in my abilities. This growth not only helped me to become a better dancer, but also to become a more confident person overall.  Secondly, having appreciation and belief in oneself can help to reach one's goals. When we believe in ourselves and our abilities, we are more likely to take risks and pursue our dreams. This can lead to greater success and fulfillment in life. For example, a friend of mine always had a passion for music and wanted to become a singer. However, for years, she doubted her abilities and was afraid to take the leap. It wasn't until she started taking singing lessons and performing in public that she began to believe in herself and her talents. This newfound confidence allowed her to pursue her dream of becoming a professional singer, and she has since achieved great success in the industry.  In addition to personal growth and reaching one's goals, developing one's own talents and skills can also lead to greater happiness and fulfillment in life. When we are able to do something well and enjoy it, we are more likely to feel satisfied and content. For example, I love to paint and find it to be a relaxing and fulfilling hobby. When I am able to create something beautiful and express myself through art, I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment that brings me joy.  In conclusion, developing one's own talents and skills is essential for personal growth, reaching one's goals, and finding happiness and fulfillment in life. It is important to believe in oneself and have appreciation for what one can do. By focusing on self-improvement and		1
Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student on the topic of separating children from their relatives to reduce evil behavior:  As I researched the topic of separating children from their relatives to reduce the tendency of children to perform evil acts, I found it to be a complex and controversial issue. On one hand, some argue that separating children from their loved ones can help prevent them from being influenced by negative behaviors and attitudes. For example, if a child is raised in a household where violence is prevalent, separating them from their parents or siblings can help protect them from being exposed to this behavior.  On the other hand, others argue that separating children from their relatives can have negative effects on their emotional and psychological well-being. Children need the support and love of their family members to develop healthy emotional bonds and a strong sense of self-worth. Separating them from their relatives can lead to feelings of abandonment and rejection, which can have long-term negative consequences.  In my opinion, separating children from their relatives is not the most effective method for reducing evil behavior. While it may help prevent children from being exposed to negative behaviors, it does not address the root causes of evil behavior. Children who are raised in unstable or abusive environments may still engage in evil acts, even if they are separated from their loved ones.  Other methods, such as providing children with positive role models and teaching them empathy and compassion, may be more effective in reducing evil behavior. Positive role models can inspire children to make good choices and behave in a moral and ethical manner. Empathy and compassion training can help children understand the perspectives of others and develop a sense of social responsibility.  In conclusion, while separating children from their relatives may have some benefits, it is not the most effective method for reducing evil behavior. Other methods, such as providing positive role models and teaching empathy and compassion, may be more effective in promoting positive behavior and reducing the tendency for children to engage in evil acts.		1
 I strongly believe that pairing older and younger students together is an excellent idea. This arrangement allows for a mutually beneficial relationship in which the older student can assist the younger student and the younger student can learn from the older one. In addition, the older student can have a positive influence on the younger student, such as inspiring them to pursue certain goals or careers.  One of the most significant advantages of this pairing is that it allows for the exchange of knowledge and skills. Older students have more experience and can offer guidance and advice to younger students. On the other hand, younger students can bring new perspectives and ideas to the table. By working together, both students can learn from each other and improve their understanding of various subjects.  Furthermore, older and younger students can also help each other in other areas outside of school. For example, if a younger student is being bullied, the older student can step in and defend them. This kind of support can be invaluable in helping the younger student feel more comfortable and confident.  In addition to the academic benefits, pairing older and younger students can also lead to the formation of strong friendships. When students are paired together, they have the opportunity to get to know each other on a deeper level, and this can lead to the development of a strong bond.  Overall, I believe that pairing older and younger students is a highly beneficial arrangement that can lead to academic success, personal growth, and the formation of strong friendships. Schools should consider implementing programs that pair older and younger students together to foster a more inclusive and supportive learning environment.		1
Some people think that the face on Mars is really created by aliens. There is some scientifical evidence to this. The real fact is that the face on Mars is just a natural landform.  When NSSA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft was in space it took pictures. A few days later NASA unveiled a image. There was a natural landform that looked like a human head, shadows gave the rock some eyes, a noes, and mouth. People began thinking that it was an acutal thing created by aliens. Scientists didn't believed this though.  On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. The team up there snapped picures of the landform again and people were eager to find out the truth about the face. After seeing the picture when it was appeared on a JPL web site people now knew the truth. It is just a landform and not a face created by aliens.  It's obvious now, the face is just a naturtal landform. There were no aliens. 		0
With more and more schools offering home schooling, students are losing some of the very most valuable things they will need to learn for the rest of their lives. Some schools are now offering long distance learning as an option for students; These schools do this threw online classes and video conferencing. Students would overall not benefit from doing long distance learning because students would be more distracted and they would not learn how to work well with others.  Those is favor of this would argue that some students feel more comfortable at home and therefore would preform better. As an example the would say students with social anxiety will lean more effectively, because they are in setting in which they prefer. This matters because this gives students with problems that they can not control another option.  While an option for homeschooling can help certain students, that does not mean that there are not many things the schools can do to help those specific students. For example, Schools could talk to their staff on how is the best way to teach students with certain setbacks. The first reason that long distance learning will overall be worse is because the majority students will be distracted at home. An example of this is anyone with ADHD, if an impulsive person has trouble focusing in a setting that is frankly boring like school they probably would not focus will at home. Although the majority of students do not have ADHD, the majority Students would still be distracted because they will lose a sense of when it is time to work and when it is time to play. An example of this is any student that has problems just doing homework because they do not understand that it is time to work even though they are home. It is hard for students to choose work over the things they like, so why have students make that choice 5 times a week. This matters because being constantly distracted can hurt a students work ethic and a diminished work ethic will not get you anywhere in life. Also when students are distracted they will not preform as well when the test rolls by.  The next reason is to why long distance learning is overall less effective is because students would not learn how to work well with others. An example of this when a student works online they are not doing assignments with groups for the most part their work is individually done. School does a much better job at this, an example would be the Science fair the Science fair forces students to work together, think of ideas, and gather materials. All this matters because in the real world people are forced to work together in their jobs. working in groups can teach students how to be liked by others and be pleasant to work with. If you do not work well with others in today's world it is hard to sustain a job or keep clients.  Long distance schooling should still be available for specific students because it can benefit certain individuals really well but for the majority of students they should stick to old fashion school. While there are many benefits to long distance schooling, the old schools way of teaching is the most effective for teaching students the proper life skills they need to be in today's labor force. In the best of both worlds we can unlock every students full potential.                                                                                         		0
Cars have become an indispensable part of our lives. We use them to go to work, school, and the grocery store. We use them to visit friends and family. We even use them to go on vacation. But cars come with a number of disadvantages, including traffic congestion, pollution, and the high cost of ownership.  One of the biggest disadvantages of cars is traffic congestion. When too many people are driving on the road, it can cause traffic to back up for miles. This can make it difficult to get to your destination on time, and it can also be very frustrating. Traffic congestion can also lead to air pollution. When cars sit in traffic, they emit exhaust fumes that pollute the air. This can be harmful to our health, and it can also contribute to climate change.  Another disadvantage of cars is the high cost of ownership. Cars require regular maintenance, such as oil changes and tune-ups. They also require insurance and registration fees. In addition, the cost of gas has been steadily increasing in recent years. This can make it expensive to own and operate a car.  Finally, cars can be a major source of noise pollution. When you drive down the road, your car makes noise that can be annoying to others. This is especially true in residential areas, where people are trying to sleep at night.  There are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. One advantage is that it can reduce traffic congestion. When fewer people are driving, there is less traffic on the road. This can make it easier to get to your destination on time, and it can also be less frustrating. Reducing traffic congestion can also improve air quality. When fewer cars are on the road, there is less pollution in the air. This can be beneficial for our health, and it can also help to reduce climate change.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can save money. When you don't have to drive, you don't have to pay for gas, insurance, or registration fees. You also don't have to pay for parking. This can save you a significant amount of money each year.  Finally, limiting car usage can be good for your health. When you walk or bike instead of driving, you get more exercise. This can help you to maintain a healthy weight and reduce your risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.  In conclusion, there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, save money, and be good for your health. If you are looking for ways to reduce your impact on the environment and improve your overall well-being, consider limiting your car usage.		1
Do you ever wonder how it would be if we lived in a car free enviroment where cars where limited. There would not be any traffic jams,or heavy smog,people wont have to worry about gas prices. Our enviroment would be cleaner and better for us to live in. There are so many advantages from limiting car usage.  People with cars tend to worry about gas prices and how much money it takes to fill up their car. When limiting the usage of cars,and walk or bike it helps save your money for something other than gas. Just think of it the average person has to fill up their gas tank at least once every one to two weeks, and if they drive constantly then once every three to five days after they had just filled up their tank. Why even waste gas to go down the street to a store or to a friends when you can use a better and more conservitive type of transportation, its nonsensicle to even drive for a short amount of time if you can walk or bike to you destination. If we also limit car usage we wont have to worry much about bumper to bumper traffic or car accidents. Think of how much much time traffic on the highways wastes sometimes 20 minutes to an hour or two when we can be doing something better with our lives. Not to mention if we limited our usage our roads sidewalks and highways would all change. There would also be more outside attractions to do and be apart of, malls and stores would be different as well considering that if not much cars are around its not necassary to have shopping plaza because not much cars would be parked. Driving a car when only necessary would help people a whole lot and change and impact the way we live in a positive way.  Think of our enviroment and ozone for a minute,and how bad the fules that power our cars effect it, not only does the fules effect our enviroment it also affects us too. When we have a high amount of smog in the air due to cars it makes people congested because our air is tainted and polluted. How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid the EPA is promoting the act of reduced car communities. Its not just cars either you have motorcycles as well that harm us and the enviroment ion the same way. Not only will limiting your usage on your car will be better for your wallet it would be better for you as well considering the fact that some people if not using or having a car tend to walk or bike which is exercise and it helps to benifit you out as well as your money. Driving a car when only necessary would help people a whole lot. Considering that everyone is out of shape because of our advances in life a little walking or biking exercise will benifit us from being lazy, you can even make your walk fun with music to listen to. If we limit our usage it will help our enviroment and our health as people as well.  Cars maybe needed if you have a job or a place that you need to go that is a far stretch from where you are. Cars are very handy i'll give it that,but sometimes they are unnecessary to use in certain situations. Peolpe like having a car for freedom and having their own transportation instead of relying on something else to get them around, but the thing is that we dont actually need cars that much for things. People are just lazy and depend on cars so they dont have to walk, take a bus ,or bike to their destination but its that mind set that most of us have and thats why our enviroment is getting killed slowly. We need to stop being lazy and think of better ways to get back and forth from certain areas.  Cars can are good to have for self transportation, but there are much better ways to get from place to place without hurting your wallet and your enviroment. There are plenty of benifits from limiting car usage for everyone. When we limit car usage we dont have to worry about gas prices or smog in our enviroment or anything of that nature. Limiting gas makes us better and healthier because we are finding more physical alternative ways for transportation.    		0
Self-esteem is a crucial aspect of a person's life. It refers to the value that an individual places on themselves and their abilities. Achievement, confidence, self-respect, and setting goals are all essential components that can help build self-esteem.  Firstly, achievement is a significant factor in building self-esteem. When individuals accomplish something, they gain a sense of pride and accomplishment. This feeling of accomplishment can come from anything, whether it's getting good grades, completing a project, or achieving a personal goal. When people achieve something, they gain confidence in their abilities and feel more competent. This confidence can lead to a higher self-esteem.  Secondly, confidence is also a vital component in building self-esteem. Confidence is the belief in oneself and one's abilities. When people feel confident in themselves, they are more likely to take on new challenges and pursue their goals. This confidence can come from various sources, such as personal achievements, positive feedback from others, or simply feeling prepared for a situation. Confidence can help individuals feel more self-assured and capable, leading to a higher self-esteem.  Thirdly, self-respect is another critical factor in building self-esteem. Self-respect refers to the value that an individual places on themselves. When people respect themselves, they are more likely to take care of themselves and make healthy choices. This self-respect can come from various sources, such as personal achievements, positive feedback from others, or simply feeling good about oneself. Self-respect can help individuals feel more worthy and valuable, leading to a higher self-esteem.  Lastly, setting goals is also an essential component in building self-esteem. Goals give individuals a sense of direction and purpose. When people set goals for themselves, they are more likely to work towards achieving them. This sense of accomplishment can come from small or big goals, such as getting good grades, completing a project, or achieving a personal goal. Setting goals can help individuals feel more motivated and focused, leading to a higher self-esteem.  In conclusion, achievement, confidence, self-respect, and setting goals are all essential components that can help build self-esteem. When individuals accomplish something, feel confident in themselves, respect themselves, and set goals for themselves, they are more likely to feel valued		1
 Introduction: The electoral college is a group of people who are chosen to elect the President of the United States. Some people believe that the electoral college works while others argue that it doesn't work. In this essay, we will discuss both sides of the argument and determine whether the electoral college works or not.  Pros of the Electoral College: One of the main benefits of the electoral college is that it gives every state an equal voice in the election. This means that smaller states, such as Wyoming, have the same amount of clout as larger states, like California. This system ensures that the President is elected by the entire country, not just by a few large cities or states.  Another advantage of the electoral college is that it allows the President to be elected by people who understand the specific needs and concerns of their state. This is because candidates often focus on issues that are important to specific groups of voters. For example, a candidate may focus on environmental issues in California or on gun control in Texas.  Cons of the Electoral College: However, there are also several disadvantages to the electoral college. One of the biggest drawbacks is that it can lead to votes being wasted. This is because a candidate may not necessarily need to get every single vote in a state to win, so some votes may be cast for candidates who won't actually be the President. Additionally, the electoral college can make it difficult for candidates to campaign in certain areas that aren't considered critical to their success.  Another downside of the electoral college is that it means that the President is not elected by the majority of the population. This can lead to a candidate winning the election despite losing the popular vote by a significant number of votes. For example, in the 2000 presidential election, George W. Bush won the electoral vote, but lost the popular vote by over 500,000 votes. This means that millions of people's voices were not heard in that election.  Conclusion: In conclusion, the electoral college works to give every state an equal voice in the election and allows the President to be elected by people who understand the specific needs and concerns of their state. However, it also has drawbacks such as votes being wasted and the President not being elected by the majority of the population. Ultimately, whether the electoral college works or not depends on what you believe is the ideal way for the President to be elected.		1
Drivers Should Not Use Cell Phones in Any Capacity While Driving  Using a cell phone while driving has become very common in today's world. However, cell phone use behind the wheel can be dangerous and should be avoided. There are a few key reasons why drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any way when operating a vehicle.  First and foremost, cell phone use is a distraction from the primary task of driving. Talking, texting, or otherwise interacting with a phone requires the driver to take their eyes and attention off the road. Even hands-free use can cause cognitive distractions as the driver's mind is occupied with the phone conversation instead of focusing fully on their surroundings. This increases the likelihood of an accident occurring as the driver is not paying full attention to their driving.   Second, research has shown that cell phone use while driving can impair driving abilities similar to driving drunk. Talking on a phone makes a driver four times more likely to be involved in a car crash. Texting is even worse, making a driver 23 times more likely to crash. The physical and cognitive distractions of phones take the driver's attention away from important driving tasks like checking mirrors, monitoring speeds, and reacting to other vehicles or unexpected road conditions.  Finally, cell phone distractions can endanger more than just the driver. By taking attention away from the critical task of driving safely, cell phone use puts all passengers and other drivers and pedestrians on the road at risk. One preventable accident caused by a moment of phone-related distraction could seriously injure or even kill innocent people. As drivers are responsible for safely operating powerful vehicles, they should avoid any unnecessary distractions that jeopardize the safety of others.  In conclusion, while cell phones have become an integrated part of modern life, they do not belong in the driver's seat. The cognitive and physical distractions of phones undermine driving ability too much and endanger all people on the road. For these compelling safety reasons, drivers should abstain from cell phone use in any form when operating a vehicle. Lives depend on drivers focusing fully on the critical task of driving without distractions.		1

 Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are the future of transportation. They have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel and make our roads safer. The technology behind driverless cars is rapidly advancing, and many companies are already testing driverless cars on public roads.  One of the main benefits of driverless cars is the reduced risk of accidents on the roads. Driver error is the leading cause of accidents on the road, and driverless cars are designed to eliminate that risk. They use a combination of sensors, cameras, and software to detect obstacles and make driving decisions, which greatly reduces the risk of accidents caused by human error.  Additionally, driverless cars can reduce traffic congestion. They have the ability to communicate with each other, allowing them to coordinate their movements and avoid unnecessary lane changes and other actions that can cause traffic congestion. This technology could greatly reduce the time people spend stuck in traffic, making their daily commute faster and more efficient.  Another benefit of driverless cars is the increased safety of women and children. Women have historically been more likely to be involved in accidents caused by driver error, and driverless cars can help mitigate this risk. Additionally, children, who often do not pay attention to the road or follow traffic laws, can be a significant safety concern for children in driverless cars.  Of course, driverless cars also pose some potential challenges. One of the main concerns is the cost of the technology. Driverless cars require sophisticated equipment, including sensors, cameras, and software, which can be expensive to develop and maintain. Some people also raise concerns about the impact of driverless cars on employment, as automation could lead to the displacement of drivers.  In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to greatly improve road safety and efficiency, while also providing increased safety for women and children. While there are challenges associated with this technology, the benefits far outweigh the costs, and driverless cars are sure to become an integral part of our transportation systems in the future.		1
Generic_Name gets home from the vet and just decides to stair at his dog. "She only has three more days Generic_Name, were dong all we can for her and her death might be painful so its your call if we should put her down," the veterinarian explains. The same words keep ringing in his head, three days to live, put her down. Generic_Name call's his mom "Hi honey how's it going?" his mom says cheerfully. Generic_Name tells his mom in a monotone voice, "Mom the veterinarian said that Generic_Name only has three days to live." As Generic_Name's mom's tone changes she say's "What happened to her, is she okay?" "The doctor asked if I wanted to put her down because her death might be painful," Generic_Name explains. Generic_Name's mom tells Generic_Name, "It would be the best if you put her down." Generic_Name hangs up after not hearing what he wanted to and calls his dad, "What's up buddy," his dad say's, but as Generic_Name tells him the new's his dad is silent not knowing what to say. Generic_Name's dad tells Generic_Name to call the veterinarian and ask what percentage Generic_Name had to live. Generic_Name get's back on the phone with his dad he says, "They said only twenty percent," Generic_Name's dad says "What the heck, let her try to fight it out." When asking people for advice, they sometimes talk to more then one person, because they have a difficult choice to make, they need a new prospective, and they are bad decision makers.  A lot of time's people have a really hard decision to make and need people's advice. This is something millions of people experience every day. An example of this is when us eighth graders had to make choices about what we did or didn't want to have in our schedules, when picking out our schedules. I'm sure that we all got advice via teachers, parents, or older sibling, we all had tough decisions to make that would effect our future. Know think of Spiderman Homecoming, a movie that came out a few years ago. Peter Parker, aka Spiderman, had the decision at the end of the movie to become an Avenger, but Peter Parker learning from his experiences and what others told him decided that they are right and he is to young to become an Avenger, so Peter politely declined. Know you might say what if the people helping you make these tough decisions tell you to do something stupid? What is say to that is that you just have to have some common sense so that stupid people don't ruin your life and use the advice of other people.  Most people only think one way and have a hard time finding another solution, because they can only think of their solution, that is why it is important to get other people's prospective. As you are playing soccer with your buddy's one of your friend's pull's a muscle and you incest that you call an ambulance. Your other friend's are not thinking like you, and tell him to rest and drink water because its not that serious. In that incest you would have wasted a tone of money and wasted an ambulances time by making it come checkout your friend, that would have happened if you didn't have your other friend's who had a different prospective then you. Know by now you have probably watched Avenger's Endgame and in that movie everyone had a different prospective. Ironman had moved on and Captain America had joined a group to talk about the people they missed, but everything changed when Antman returned and had a different prospective and had the idea to build a time machine. Know you might say what if every one in your group thinks like you and has the same prospective. What I say to that is that is impossible and even if it happened then go find someone, somewhere else who thinks differently.  People can be bad at lot's of things and one of those things is making decisions. In the episode "Hurricane" of the show American Dad, Stan, the dad of the family, makes bad decision after bad decision making things worse and worse. Stan makes his family stay in there house during a hurricane and then the streets flood, later Stan let's a shark into the house and even make's worse decision's later in the episode. So as you can tell Stan isn't the best decision maker and need's other people's advice. A lot of the time professional athletes make bad decisions and one of the most recent athletes to do this was Antonio Brown. He had a great job and was probably the best receiver in the NFL at the time, and then he lost it because he started making bad decisions, such as recording private locker room meeting's and tweeting very disrespectful thing's. These bad decisions ruined his career and if he just talked to someone and talked it through he might have gotten some sense knocked into him.  Two month's have past since the veterinarian said that Generic_Name only had three day's to live and she is still alive. "Hello Generic_Name," Generic_Name's friendly neighbor say's as Generic_Name exits his apartment to go walk his dog. Generic_Name respond's happily, "Hi how's your day been," Generic_Name waiting joyfully for a response. "It's been just fine thanks for asking Generic_Name," Generic_Name's neighbor say's as Generic_Name say's his goodbyes so he can go enjoy this wonderful day with his lovely dog that is still alive thanks to the advice he got from the people around him. When asking people for advice, they sometimes talk to more then one person, because they have a difficult choice to make, they need a new prospective, and they are bad decision makers.                		0

"HONK! BEEP BEEP!." "Hey! What are you doing!? You're causing a traffic jam!" What causes a traffic jam? Cars. They get us from point A to B for sure but, do we really need to rely on them that often? I don't think so. As we limit our car usage, the air pollution lowers, fewer car accidents happens, and road rage? Gone.  Limiting car usage have many benitfits, such as the air pollution lowers. In some countries, for example Paris, they ban driving due to smog. fter near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city. As of that Monday, they would fine motorists with even-numbered license plates a 22-euro fine($31). The effect of this was that public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday.  In Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians participated in a car-free day leaving the streets traffic jam free. It was their third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted. It didn't stop people from participating even though gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" said a businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bike with his wife. This campaign began back in the mid-1990s. Without cars, parks and sports centers have bloomed throughtout the city. They even fixed the uneven pitted sidewalks and replaced them with smooth sidewalks. A city of 7 million, rush hour have dramatically cut traffic as they have their car-free day.  As for the United States, President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies shows that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses as each year go by. Another study has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39 year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak's research has found. Without cars, people are expected to walk more and car pool with friends or take buses. This will dramatically decrease greenhouse gas and air pollution. In Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Moter Company, has laid out a bussiness plan where they create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and impove safety.  In conclusion, by not driving a car, air pollution lowers, fewer car accidents happen, and no traffic jams. From different sources, different effects happens when cars are banned. In Paris, smog is a thing in the past, no traffic jam for a city of 7 million in Bogota, and in Barcelona, public transportations are connected and is faster to get to point A to point B. By not driving cars, we won't cause car accidents and it will improve safety for everyone. Walking never cause problems and can get you anywhere.    		0
There has been a lot of dispute about the electoral college, therefore causing much confusion. The president should be elected by popular vote only. This allows all voters to be treated equal, avoid untrsutworthhy electors and everyone will be given the same amount of knowledge about the campaigns.  The electoral college creates an unfair set up for the voters. The winner-takes all system gives all the electors to the presidential candidate who won. This system disregards that the opposing candidate received any votes, because all the electors are given to the winner. This doesn't give a chance to the candidates whose party is not necessarily popular in that state. Candidates, therefore spend more time and money campaigning in states they know their party is popular in. According to Bradfor Plumer in 2000, 25 of the largest media markets did not see a campaign ad, because they lived in one of the seventeen states that had no campaigning. Some candiates don't even campaign in some states based on this. According to an excerpt from  Mother Jones by Bradford Plumer most candidates focus on the "swing" states where it is close competiton.  In the case of tie in the electoral vote, the house of reprensentatives vote. This means one  vote represents the whole state. How is that fair for a state like Wyoming that has 500,000 voters?  Another popular dilema of the electoral college is untrustworthy electors. The electors are chosen in different ways. According to Bradford Palmer in 1960 there was a problemwith the Louisiana legistlature choosing bias electors. Segregationists wanted to be rid the democratic electors and replace them with electors who would not vote for John F. Kennedy. In another case, there has been a history of electors voting for whom they want instead of their party's vote.  Voters often are not update onall the campaigns due to the unfairness of the electoral vote. There's no doubt that the electoral college is a confusing subject, but this often creates confusion in the ballot box too. There has been times when voters have casted votes for the wrong candidate. The voters know about the presidential candidate not the elector. States often do not get the same level of campaigning as eachother. According to  Slate Magazine a larger state gets more attention from the presidential candidates than a smaller state does. Over 60 percent of citizens who vote would like a direct election instead of the kind we have now, says Bradford Palmer.  The electoral college has caused enough confusion in its lifetime. The United States should change to using only the popular vote to allow all the voters to be created equal, avoid untrustworthy electors, and everyone will be given the same amount of knowledge. This will prevent bias people and a more knowledgable campaign.                    		0
While some speculate the Face on Mars is an ancient monument carved by extra-terrestrials, the evidence clearly shows it is a natural landform sculpted over time by environmental forces. The Face looks artificially constructed to our eyes because of an instinctive pattern-recognition in human vision. However, upon careful scientific study, it becomes evident the Face originated through natural processes rather than intelligent design.  Several key points from the article support the claim that the Face is natural in origin. First, images from newer NASA satellites with higher resolution show the Face lacks precise symmetrical features one would expect from an alien artifact. Its outline is vaguely simular to a human face when seen at a certain angle and lighting, but it has an irregular, rounded shape more indicative of natural rock formations. Second, stereoscopic images reveal the Face is composed of layered strata that slope downward, proving it was shaped by natural forces like erosion rather than precise tool marks. Over millions of years, wind and rainfall would have slowly weathered away the rock in gradually sloping layers.   Another important piece of evidence is that similar linear patterns of rock strata are common throughout Mars. If the same natural forces that shaped the rest of the Martian landscape were able to carve linear patterns elsewhere without intelligent design, it stands to reason they formed the Face as well through mundane geologic processes rather than alien intervention. Furthermore, follow-up missions have photographed numerous other landforms on Mars that resemble faces or objects, undermining the idea that the original Face is anomalously artificial. Natural patterns often resemble familiar shapes by chance.  In conclusion, while the idea of ancient aliens visiting Mars to construct monumental faces appeals to our sense of wonder, careful scientific analysis shows the so-called "Face on Mars" originated due to simple natural causes, not intelligent design. The preponderance of evidence from multiple NASA missions proves the Face is a unique but inconspicuous part of the normal geologic landscape of Mars, unreflective of extraterrestrial visits in the planet's distant past. Unless stronger counter-evidence emerges, it remains just another quirk of perception, not an actual sign of Mars' hypothetical inhabitants.		1
Working together is undoubtedly more beneficial than working alone. When individuals collaborate, they can accomplish more in less time and with better results. Here are some reasons why:  Firstly, working together reduces the amount of work. When everyone contributes to a task, the load is shared among team members, making it easier to complete. For instance, if a group of students are working on a project, they can divide the tasks among themselves, allowing each person to focus on their specific area of expertise. This not only saves time but also helps to avoid burnout.  Secondly, working together promotes efficiency. When people work together, they can bounce ideas off each other, share resources, and learn from one another. This leads to a more productive and streamlined process, resulting in a better end product. For example, a group of students working on a science fair project can share their research findings and build upon each other's ideas to come up with a more comprehensive and innovative project.  Thirdly, working together creates opportunities to utilize diverse skill sets. When individuals with different strengths and weaknesses work together, they can complement each other's abilities, leading to a more well-rounded and effective team. For instance, a group of students with different talents and interests can work together on a music project, with one person handling the lyrics, another person handling the melody, and another person handling the production.  Fourthly, working together provides constructive criticism for a better end result. When individuals work alone, they may not receive the same level of feedback and support as they would when working in a group. However, when working together, team members can provide constructive criticism and suggestions to improve the project, leading to a higher quality end result. For example, a group of students working on a school play can provide feedback on each other's acting, directing, and set design, resulting in a more polished and engaging performance.  While there are some advantages to working alone, such as increased focus and productivity, there are also circumstances where working together is more beneficial. For instance, when working on a complex project that requires a diverse range of skills, it may be more efficient to work in a group. Additionally, when working on a project with a tight deadline, collaborating with others can		1
As an 8th-grade student, I believe that both traditional in-person educational instruction and distance learning instruction have their advantages and disadvantages. While traditional in-person instruction provides students with the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers face-to-face, distance learning allows for more flexibility and convenience.  One of the main advantages of traditional in-person instruction is the opportunity for students to interact with their peers and teachers. This interaction allows for the development of social skills and the ability to collaborate with others. Additionally, in-person instruction provides students with immediate feedback from their teachers, which can help them identify areas where they need to improve.  On the other hand, distance learning provides students with more flexibility and convenience. Students can learn at their own pace, and they can access course materials at any time. This allows students to balance their studies with other commitments, such as work or family responsibilities. Additionally, distance learning can be more cost-effective than traditional in-person instruction, as it eliminates the need for commuting and other expenses associated with attending classes on-campus.  However, there are also some disadvantages to both forms of instruction. One disadvantage of traditional in-person instruction is that it can be difficult for students to attend classes if they live far away from the school. Additionally, in-person instruction can be less accessible for students with disabilities, as they may need specialized accommodations that are not available in a traditional classroom setting.  Distance learning also has its disadvantages. One disadvantage is that students may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers and teachers. Additionally, distance learning can be more challenging for students who require more structure and guidance in their studies. Without the support of their peers and teachers, these students may struggle to stay on track and achieve their academic goals.  In my personal opinion, both traditional in-person instruction and distance learning instruction have their advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on the individual student's needs and circumstances. For students who require more structure and guidance in their studies, traditional in-person instruction may be the best option. However, for students who need more flexibility and convenience, distance learning may be the better choice.  In conclusion, both traditional in-person instruction and distance learning instruction have their advantages and disadvantages. While traditional in-person instruction provides students with the opportunity		1
 I am going to start explaining and giving my opinion on the topic of technology. In my view, technology has had a significant impact on the world and has made our daily lives more convenient. For example, transportation has become easier due to advancements in technology. Today, we have access to our own cars or public transportation, allowing us to travel anywhere without any problems. Additionally, we can now fly to any country in the world, making it easier to explore new places.  In my opinion, technology has a positive impact on our daily lives. It has made our daily necessities more accessible and convenient. For example, we can now learn about any topic online, making it easier for students to access information and learn about what they are interested in. Furthermore, technology has made it easier for people to communicate with each other, regardless of their location.  Technology is constantly evolving and will continue to do so in the future. For example, in the past, it was difficult to communicate with family and friends who were far away. However, with the invention of the telephone, it became easier to communicate with them. Today, we have access to smartphones that allow us to do much more than just make calls. We can take pictures, read books, and even play games.  In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on the world and has made our daily lives more convenient. It has made our daily necessities more accessible and convenient, and has made it easier for people to communicate with each other. I believe that technology will continue to evolve and will have an even greater impact on our lives in the future.		1
In the articla "Making Mona Lisa Smile" they talk about how scientist came up with a technology that can read how people are feeling and what there emotions are. On this new technolgy I personaly both agree and disagree with whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.  I agree with this technology only because of how they are planning on using this for students. They are planning on making a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. They said that this computer would be like if the computer knew you're emotions on each ad. For example if there was an ad that appeared on you're screen that you didn't like then the next ad would be on a whole different topic. But if an ad that you did like came up on you're screen then the computer will know wheather to have a similar ad appear next. They are also saying that this technology on a computer could know when a student is confused or bored, then it could modify the lessons, like a human instructor. The part where I don't agree with this new technology is where the technology its self would let other people know exactly what you are thinking and how you are feeling. I feel like this would interfear with others privacy. For example, if some one was really happy because something good was going to happen to them or to someone else then if others knew they where so happy for this then they would most likely be asking them and that person might want to keep it as a secret. This also goes for if someone is not feeling good or is really just sad about something but didn't want to talk about it because it was vary personal to them then if others where to use this technology on them then that would interfear with that persons privacy.  On this article "Makeing Mona Lisa Smile" I have discribed some of the reasons on why I both agree and disagree with having this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Just because of the fact that there are both positive and negative effects on this statement as I have described.     		0
I believe that arts education should be essential for a well-rounded education. It is important for students to learn about art because it helps them develop their creativity and imagination. Art also teaches students how to express themselves in different ways.  For example, when students learn how to draw or paint, they are able to express their feelings and emotions through their art. This is especially important for students who may have trouble expressing themselves in words.  In addition, art education can help students develop important skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking. When students create art, they have to think about things like color, composition, and perspective. This requires them to use their problem-solving skills and think critically about their work.  Furthermore, art education can also help students develop their social skills. When students work on art projects together, they learn how to collaborate and communicate with others. This is an important skill that will help them in all areas of their lives.  In conclusion, arts education should be essential for a well-rounded education because it helps students develop their creativity, imagination, problem-solving skills, critical thinking skills, and social skills. It is a valuable part of a student's education and should not be optional.		1
Dear senator, voting on a president is a big deal. it decides who has power over the U.S. Now the way we elect our president to me is a very efficient process, this is as you know is electoral college, (EC). For the past 200 some odd years, when the founding fathers created this system, it has worked everytime. yes, there have been recounts but those were human mistakes, not a break in the system. when electing a president, I think we need to keep electoral college  President Obama, in his state of the union adress, said, "If it isn't broken, dont fix it". This is true for EC. it still works so why in the world would we want to change it. Would you fix a car if it ran to it's maximum capacity? Some on the opposite side may say that their is a chance for a tie, isn't that fair though? In any fair competition there is always a chance of a tie.  EC is also the most fair in the sense of political party, (liberals and conservitives). It dosnt favor any one party. It does this by giving equal amount of vote for the size of state and for each to win the greater number of electoral college. "The EC requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president."(source 3) This, in basic terms, means that if the southern region is more conservitive (which it is in most cases) doesn't have enough electoral votes to elect a president. The other regions have as equel of a vote as the south does, thus keeping a nice fair election.  In colclusion, EC is, in my opinion, the best and most fair way to elect our leader. other ways may be more efficient but EC is the most far and it has worked since it was created. So these are the reasons that it should remain in use.    		0
 An increasingly popular concept in urban planning is the establishment of car-free cities. This idea stems from the growing concern for environmental sustainability, traffic congestion, and public health. Car-free cities are places where private vehicles are prohibited, and residents are encouraged to use alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of car-free cities, the obstacles that they face, and the potential solutions for implementing this concept successfully.  Car-free cities have several advantages. First, they can significantly reduce carbon emissions, as they eliminate the need for cars that rely on fossil fuels. This can help mitigate climate change and improve air quality. Second, they can reduce traffic congestion, as cars are one of the main causes of traffic jams. By limiting the number of cars on the road, car-free cities can improve traffic flow and reduce travel times. Third, they can improve public health, as walking and biking are known to be beneficial for physical health. By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation, car-free cities can decrease sedentary lifestyles and increase physical activity levels.  However, car-free cities also face several obstacles. One of the main challenges is the need for alternative modes of transportation. While walking and biking are great options for short distances, they may not be feasible for longer trips. To address this, many cities have implemented bike-sharing programs or invested in public transit systems that connect different parts of the city. Another challenge is the need for infrastructure, such as bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly walkways. Cities need to invest in these infrastructure projects to support the growth of car-free transportation. Finally, the transition to car-free cities can be expensive, as it requires significant financial investment and changes in infrastructure and transportation systems.  In conclusion, car-free cities are a promising solution to the problems of environmental sustainability, traffic congestion, and public health. While they face several obstacles, cities that successfully implement this concept can reap significant benefits for their residents and the planet. To achieve success, cities must address the need for alternative modes of transportation, invest in infrastructure, and make financial investments in the transition to car-free transportation. With a long-term commitment to this concept, car-free cities can become a model for sustainable urban living.		1
 The face on Mars  In recent weeks, scientists have made an amazing discovery on the surface of Mars. A face-like structure has been identified, which has sent shockwaves through the scientific community and the public alike. This discovery has sparked a lot of interest and speculation about the origins of the structure and what it could mean for the future of Mars exploration.  The face is located in the Tharsis region of Mars, which is one of the largest and most visible volcanic regions on the planet. Scientists hope that the face will provide them with more information about the planet's history and the possibility of life. They have already started collecting data from the face and analyzing it to determine its composition and structure.  One theory is that the face could be the result of centuries or even millennia of erosion and weathering, caused by winds and rain on the surface of Mars. This would explain the formation of the face-like structure, which could have been carved out by the forces of nature over time.  Another theory is that the face could be the result of a geological event, such as an impact from a meteorite or comet. This could have caused the face to form quickly over a short period of time, rather than slowly over millions of years.  Whatever the cause, the face on Mars is an exciting discovery that could change our understanding of the planet and its potential for supporting life. Scientists are eager to learn more about the structure and its origins, and we can expect to hear more about this fascinating discovery in the coming months and years.  As we continue to explore Mars, it is important to remember that we are not alone in the universe. The discovery of the face on Mars is a reminder that there is still so much to learn about our own planet and the countless others that surround us. Whether the face on Mars was formed by erosion or a geological event, it is a testament to the power of nature and the potential for life on other planets.		1
Dear State Senator,  While I normally don't have any complaints, and being the person I am not many things "bug me", but I recently found that I disagree with a certain argument. And while it is near voting times, I believed it's best for me to send you my side on this continuous debate to change your mind on the matter. The electoral college has had its share of arguments and I would like to make my side seen knowing I have quite a bit of logical arguments. Please read with an open mind.  The electoral college is unfair in many ways, this one however can be seen as minor. The electoral college gives an easier way to get  tie, and although a tie hasn't been a main focus, it can prove to be a problem. I read an article stating that if a tie were to happen the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. This would anger a heap of people for many reasons, one stating it would almost rule out their vote.  Secondly, the electoral college simply takes away from voting in general. An example of this is lets say Obama won popular vote, he should win because thats what America wants right? No, because what if another president won electoral vote? that president would win and take away the point in voting. This is unfair because we the people would like to have a better say in who becomes our president.  In the article I read, it stated "At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. unfair, outdated, irrational" I agree completely. How is it irrational? Well simply because it is just an extra step added on. In all reality our country would be fine without it. Popular vote is exactly what we need, and that alone is enough. And while I do believe it's good to go an extra step, it shouldn't go when not needed. This to me is most important because I could argue all day long and in the end this would be my argument.  Thank you for your time and please take this into consideration, I realize that it has its upsides but it is just unfair, outdated, and irrational. And please notice the other downsides aswell, while I did not have the time or room to include them.  Your friend,  PROPER_NAME   		0
In the artical Making Mona Lisa Smile the author is describing how a new technology called the Factial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotiolns. No I don't think that using a computer will identify how a person is feeling and what there mood Is for the day. And I say this because what if they not really feeling that way what If they computer is guessing what thart person is really feeling. Like how would you even calculate what the percentage is and how would you even know what number to caculate. Usually how we tell If someone we know Is down Is by there face and you can tell If something happened or If they ae just tired. There is really no need for a computer to try to tell If someone is sad , happy, or mad It's all about your face expression and the way they walk and carry themselfes. When you look back at the text you can see that a classroom computer could recongize when a student is being confused or bored. You really can't though yes it's possible but for now you can't really try to relate to the passage and having computers read your mood and thoughts and feelings. This Is my reason why computers doesnt read minds and thoughts. 		0
Why I think that students would best benefit on taking online learning courses?  The online learning course would be a great option for the students and it that will come in handy in their near future. In reality, I think that students would best benefit on taking the learning online courses. My reasons why I think of this is because it could be kinda like classwork, but in a fun way, and the course would also want to know what level you are, at by doing pre-tests at the beginning of the course. While some other students would best benefit on learning, by having video conferencing with someone. Their reason why they think this is because they think they might learn something by watching someone teach them. These are the reasons why I think that students would best benefit on learning online courses, and it will come handy in the near future.  In reality, I think that students would best benefit on taking learning online courses. My reason for this is, that it could be kinda like classwork, but in a fun way. What I mean by all of this is, that some of the online courses may have games in them. My example for this is, that it might help you understand more by playing the games. These are the reasons why I think that students would best benefit on learning online courses, and it will come handy in the near future.  In reality, I think that students would best benefit on taking learning online courses. My reason for this is, that the course would also want to know what level you are at, by doing pre-tests at the beginning of the course. What I mean by all of this is, that it will explain on what questions you got wrong on the pre-test. My example for this is, that they could help you understand more for upcoming tests. This is why I think that students would best benefit on learning online courses, and it will come handy in the near future.  In reality, some people think that other students would best benefit on learning by having video conferencing with someone. Their reason of this is because they think that they might learn something, by watching someone teach front of them. What they mean by all of this is, that the video could explain it in a better way and it could help them understand more. Their example of this is, that they think it will be better if someone teach them on how to do the work. This is why they think that other students would best benefit on learning, by having video conferencing with someone.  In conclusion, I think that students would best benefit on taking learning online course. My reasons why I picked this is because it could be kinda like classwork, but in a fun way, and the course would want to know what level you are at by doing pre-tests at the beginning of the course. Some other students may not believe this because they have never done this before, and they might understand how easy and fun online course can be if they give it a try. This is why I think that students would best benefit on learning online courses and it will come handy in the near future.		0
Dear State Senator,  I strongly believe that we should change our election to popular vote. The Electoral College has a ton of problems that can not be worked out. In the artical "What is the Electoral College?" it states in line 7 that, "most states have a "winner-take-all" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate." I understand how majority rules, but the number electoral votes should be proportional to the popular vote. I am aware that, "The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast." as stated on line 22 of In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. However, I would rather be in a situtation where I know my vote counted for the president, than use the Electoral College and avoid ties that could still happen. "It is the electors who elect the President, not the people." as stated in line 15 of In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, it states that "That those electors could always defy the will of the people." What is the point in voting if the will of the people can be defied? I strongly believe that we should change to popular vote.    		0
I think they should make driverless cars but not all of them should be driverless they should just make some. I think people should have a choice of what they want and that would be way better. so peoeple don't complain about driverlesscars. But i do think that driverless cars are cool and is not a bad idea. There is alot of people that would like to have one.  They would help alot for people that can't drive so they would be way more helpful and i think there will be less car crashes. It wolud chnge alot but somtimes change is good and what if it makes this country better. In the passage it says that some companies are already thinking about making them by 2020. So i do think it's going to happen and i am really excited to see them and how they are going to work.  The future is here and we have to accept it i think it's for the best. And i guess we are going to see if they work out. I hope they do and i hope people love them.		0
Phones & Driving  Communication has progressed from the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 to the endless communication that is now available in the 21st century, but it has come at a price. People's need for communication, specifically with cell-phones has created the serious issue of cell-phone use while driving. This issue leads to serious consequences, and has been met with new laws and features added to cars to keep the roads safe from cell-phone use while driving.  This issue has caused various accidents and sometimes deaths. The distraction that cell-phones create while driving has the ability to seriously injure or even take someone's life away. For many years, while most states have not had laws regulating cell-phone use while driving, there have been various PSA campaigns warning against cell-phone use while driving, usually specific with texting and driving. These PSAs are meant to scare drivers hoping that it will discourage this dangerous behavior.  These distracted drivers are usually texting to reply to someone, using their satellite navigation system on their phone, or could be adjusting their music through their phone. These behaviors have been specifically targeted by many states that have enacted laws to prevent cell-phone use that can cause accidents. Georgia, specifically, passed the hands-free rule, fining drivers for cell-phone use, holding the phone. This law can be easily obeyed because of the adjustments created by car companies and other accessories that are available. More recent cars have options for phones through the car to keep the driver focused on the road but keeping the communication possible for the driver. Cars may have an aux cord or a bluetooth option to be able to receive and make calls without touching the phone. Phones connected to the car this way, can play music through a cell-phone through the car, then the driver can control volume and choice of song through the steering wheel. There are many car accessories to make phone use safer like an attachment to the windshield that holds the driver's phone, to keep their eyes in the front to the road rather than to the side to look at their phone. These adjustments that coincide with laws like the hands-free rule allow drivers to safely use their cell-phones while driving.  This issue has lead to serious consequences, and has been met with new laws and features added to cars to keep the roads safe from cell-phone use while driving, but will continue to have serious consequences. While there are many solutions to this issue have been created it will still have consequences. People will continue to be injured or killed by this issue but without any restrictions or inventions this issue would not continued at the same rate. The precautions keep the roads as safe as they can be, because people will continue to use their cell-phones while driving, but at least it is more regulated and less distracting now.                                                           		0
Cars have become an extravigant part of our daily lives, to helping us with transportation or just taking us out for a ride out in the city. They have made their ways into our world.. But are they truly helping us and our enviornment.?  Out in Vauban, Germany- Residents of an upscale community, and other grand cities all around the world have given up one of mankinds best teleportation invention: You guessed it... their auto-mobiles.  In one of the excerpts from  "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."  the city of Vauban's streets they have officially gone "car-free" - except for some of the main thoroughfare, in which the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not whatsoever own any cars at all, and 57 percent of the residents here have sold their car just to move here. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two said "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." she quotes. Middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. That, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are now responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 52 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. "All of our development since World war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change." said an official of Transportation America, David Goldberg. In tghe United States, the Enviornmental Protection Agency is promorting "car reduced" communitites, and legislators are starting to act cautiously.  Other cities are also starting to take after Vauban. After many days of near- record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving banm to clear the air of the global city and are trying to have a smog free city.  In the excerpt  "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."  by Andrew Selsky. Bogota, Colombia has taken noticed also an has a program that's set to spread to other countries as well as theirs. It was the third staright year in which they have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day without cars in their capital city of 7 million people. Their goal for doing this event for a day is to promote alternative transportation and to reduce smog as well. As for the United States of America some people have take a toll for this ambitious goal in other countries that has left many researchers ponderwing a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving? Researchers say in American Behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewwer licenses as each year goes by. But as of April 2013 the economy has been able to risen and now many people can start buying new cars. Part of the reason why driving sessions were decreasing was because residents could not afford cars, and unem[ployment were't going to work. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downtuern and appears to be persisting now that recovery is under way. Only the next few years will be telling how our enviornmental world will be.  As for this, depriving cars out of the road can lead to a free smog envionrment where more people can be healthier and think smart about their world, and it might just actually help keep the planet clean and other ideas like getting rid of cars for good. Only we can lead how our future generations will view this world, so why not benefit earth instead of destroying it...?    		0
Title: The Ethical Debate on Animal Research  Animal research has been a topic of ethical debate for many years. Some people argue that animals should not be used in scientific research, while others believe that it is necessary to use animals for the advancement of science. In this essay, I will argue against the use of animals in scientific research.  One of the main reasons why animals should not be used in scientific research is that it is cruel and inhumane. Animals are often subjected to painful experiments, which can cause them to suffer and even die. For example, they may be injected with harmful chemicals, forced to breathe toxic fumes, or have their bodies mutilated for the purpose of testing. These experiments can cause physical and psychological harm to the animals, and they can also cause them to experience fear and stress.  Another reason why animals should not be used in scientific research is that there are alternative methods available. Scientists can use computer simulations, cell cultures, and other non-animal methods to conduct research. These methods are often more accurate and reliable than animal testing, and they do not cause harm to animals. Therefore, it is unnecessary to use animals in scientific research when there are alternative methods available.  Furthermore, the use of animals in scientific research is not always necessary. Many experiments are conducted simply because it is easier or more convenient to use animals, rather than because they are necessary for the advancement of science. For example, some cosmetic companies conduct animal testing simply to ensure that their products are safe for human use, even though there are alternative methods available.  In conclusion, the use of animals in scientific research is unethical, unnecessary, and cruel. Animals should not be subjected to painful experiments, especially when there are alternative methods available. It is time for scientists to find more humane ways to conduct research, and to stop using animals as test subjects.		1
The Face on Mars was not created by aliens. There are more facts to prove that aliens have nothing to do with the Face on Mars. There are less facts to prove that aliens did it. Use commen sense. Don't assume somethig without having facts to back it up.  The first fact that tells us that it was not aliens is, scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth." This tells us that aliens didn't make it, and that it just formed from shadows that made it look like a face on mars when it was just an illusion.  In the text it states, thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.  Furthermore, the picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. "it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," says Garvin. "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."  Those were some facts that tell us that aliens didn't have nothing to do with the Face on Mars. It was just an illusion. It made people wonder if there was life on Mars or if there use to be an ancient civilzation on Mars. But, in the end it was just a rock formation. There are more facts to back up that aliens didn't do it. There are less facts to prove that aliens did do it. People saw the picture of the Face on Mars and assumed it had to do with aliens since it looked so much like a face. But, its best to not assume something before you have strong facts to back it up. The Face on Mars isn't forgotten though. It's still something amazing that happend on Mars. It was the first time that something so amazing was caught on camara on Mars. It might never be seen again. We can always remember it as the Face on Mars. 		0
 I believe that extending the school day by two hours can be a negative decision, as not all students agree with it and it can be a complex issue. For some students, it may be difficult to adjust to the longer school day, especially if they have other commitments in the afternoon.  On the other hand, I think that the benefits and disadvantages of a four-day school week can be positive and negative. While some students may appreciate the shorter school week, others may feel that it is too short and that they are not getting enough education. Additionally, the four-day school week can also have negative consequences, such as students staying out too late and not getting enough rest.  In my opinion, it is important to consider the needs and preferences of all students when making decisions about school schedules. While some students may benefit from a longer school day, others may not, and it is important to find a balance that works for everyone.  Ultimately, I believe that it is better to err on the side of caution and not make any drastic changes to the school schedule without fully considering the potential consequences. Instead, it is important to gather input from students, teachers, and parents and work together to find a solution that is fair and equitable for all.		1
Dear state senator,  I write to argue in favor of the Electoral College. The Electoral College is as it says on the 3rd source "widely regarded as an anchronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidates who receives the most popular votes the winner." That was in my opinion pretty self explanatory. This letter is based on information from article sourses I read.  First of all, I would like to start by saying that the Electoral College is helpful to avoid problems where no candidate got a majority. For example in the 5th part of the source 3 it says "Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both  had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively)" which backs up my claim. I understand the "wrong" part of it like in the 2nd source it says "If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Karry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry." meanning voters vote for a slate of electors and they choose the president. Honestly I dont see it as that "wrong" but thats my opinion.  Second, I agree with the Electoral College despite the lack of "democratic pedigree" for five reasons. First, "Certainty of Outcome" meanning winning candidate's share of the Electoral College exceeds his share of the popular vote, example, Obama vs Romney. Second, in the Everyone's President part it says that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, for example, "Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win". Number 3, "Swing States" the "winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in [2012] election-to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states". There is also number 4 where the Electoral College "restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution" amnd there is number 5, "Avoid Run-Off Elections" which is what I used in the second paragraph as a claim.  In summation im in favor with the Electoral College for many reasons. After reading through this side and the opponing side of the argument I can honestly say that I prefer this method as it is. Yes there is a bad side to it but there is a bad side to everything and it shouldn't be big enough for anyone to oppose it. Well thank you for taking the time to read through this.     		0
The advantages of limiting car usage is a good idea because this way it will take away stress and lower air pollution and make the global city clean and fresh. Also this will promote alternative transportation and will reduce smog and will save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety in the communities.  In source 2 by Robert Duffer: Paris bans driving due to smog is important because after the day of pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air in the city. For example, in paragraph 14 said "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five days of intensifying smog..... The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world" what this mean is that if the cold came and there are warmer days this can caused the layer in the air to trap the car emissions, which then will create pollution. If we stop the used of car driving this will help the environment around us.  In source 3 by Andrew Selsky: Car- free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, is important because there is a program that is set to spread to other countries around the world, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or even take buses to work during an car free day. For exmaple, in paragraph 21 said " It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million" what this mean is that during the third straight years cars are banned and only buses are allowed this can promote alternative transportation and will reduce smog in the long run.  In source 4 by Elisabeth Rosenthal: The End of Car Culture is important because if socialogists believe it will have a beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment. For example in paragraph 43 said "Pedestrain, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety" what this mean is that if cars are no longer being used this can make the environment a better places because there are no pollution, no taffic and the environment is clean.  In advances, the advantages of limiting cars usage is a good idea because there will be no pollution in the air, there will be no traffic jams everyday. Also, Connected the network this can save us time, conserve resources, lower emissions and will improve the safety around the world and will reduce smog.                    		0
I don't like the proposal that the principal is making. To require students to have at least a B to play sports is unbelievable. In some cases people who mentally can't get a B are discriminated against, C is a passing grade although not a good one to have, and you could suddenly have a really hard lesson which brings your letter grade down.  There are students out there that find it is impossible for them mentally to get a B. They could have a ADHD which causes them to get really distracted and they aren't able to pay attention.  Also, they could be autistic where they find the easiest thing the hardest. Such as, calling 911 or other simple activities. I have two cousins that are autistic and I know how hard it is for them to learn and fit in. This rule is unfair to them.  Also, a C is considered a passing grade. Although your parents might not approve of it, it will get you into the next grade. So why make it so that people that are passing in school should have to work harder to just get a better passing grade. It all just adds up to more work and more time spent on studies. Students need to also get a decent amount of exercise and this isn't provided to us if we are inside learning 24/7.  The school has many courses to teach you throughout the year and some will be harder than others. You could find that when you have a B you suddenly have a C. This could be because the subject that you are being taught is much harder than ones that you have done throughout the year. For example, My Spanish teacher predicted that are letter grade would drop on the subject we where learning. She said that this subject was the hardest thing we would be learning all year.  To say the least, I feel that we, as students, have the right to play sports as long as we are passing. The rule that the principal proposes would make me and a lot of other people unhappy. I hope that you do		0
Dear Principal,  I think it is great that you wish students will need to improve there grades to do sports but, some students are not capable of getting up to a B in their average. I have decided that you should give them work do to for extra credit.  This would be a great way for students to participate in sports. If they refuse to do the extra credit then have them raise their grade on their own. Another thing i think would be great is if you could hold an after school tutoring class for them after school. Also if they refuse that then i guess they wont get to try out for sports.  I think if you don't give these students a chance with this opportunity they wont be capable of ever trying out for sports unless you go for this decison. The extra credit or tutoring will help improve their grades so they will have a chance in an activity that they are interested in.  Once the students have improved there grades with this opportunity and don't try hard to keep it that way then you should not let then volunteer in this sport. A good thing about this decision is that they are doing physical activity and that is a good process for a child to have. Another decision I have thought of is Maybe change the average B down to a C in volunteering for sports.  This decision is a great way for a child to express themselves in what they like in sports.

It is no small feat to be yourself in a world where conformity is rewarded and individuality is often frowned upon. To love and value yourself is particularly important in light of this situation, as it enables you to bravely strive for your goals and take risks. Courage is essential in accomplishing any activity, which makes it a key component of the greatest accomplishment of all--being yourself.  Your parents and teachers have likely reminded you on many occasions throughout your life to embrace yourself and all that comes with it. They know that self-love and accomplishment are intertwined, and that accomplishments can provide a stepping stone toward a positive future. This is something as simple as a schoolteacher reminding you to be proud of yourself for trying your best on a project, or a parent telling you that they’re proud of the way you handled a problem. These statements may seem small at the time, but they embody an important truth about loving yourself--your accomplishments shape your future.  The importance of loving and valuing yourself and your accomplishments cannot be overstated. Without self-love and courage, it is difficult to make the most of our talents and achieve our dreams. Loving and valuing yourself provides the courage to put yourself out there and take risks, which in turn helps create great accomplishments that will shape your future.		1
Dear Principal,  I believe that the first policy is better because some students need their cellular phones during school to do things like text their mom and tell them basketball practice is cancelled and they need a ride home or even to tell them that they will be staying after school for a test, to grade homework, etc. Students having them during free times is no harm because its not like they are learning anything during that time anyways. Also, they don't get them in class so its not going to interfere with their learning. If you catch a kid with a cell phone in class you could just take it away and after the second time the kid could lose privilege to have it during free times. Plus its giving students more responsibilities and they have more opportunities to use honesty. Using cell phones during free time is no harm because what if they need lunch money and there parents have a long distance number that the school phone cannot call. What are they going to do then? Go without lunch because they don't want to have to pay the school back or are to afraid to go up to the office and ask for money. Students will be hungry the rest of the day just because they couldn't get a-hold of their parents. If students cannot have cell phones at school ant all then what if they need them after school cause they walk a long distance or walk a short distance but still feel safe with the phone in there hand in case of trouble. Students use their cell phones during school anyways so why get them in trouble for it why not just make it alright. Students have been waiting for this cell phone policy to change for a long time now so lets just stop torturing them and give them what they want just this one time.  Sincerely,  A Convincing 8th Grader		0
 Introduction Driverless cars, also known as self-driving cars, are vehicles that can operate without the need for a human driver. The technology behind these cars has been rapidly advancing in recent years, and they are expected to become more widespread in the future. In an article titled   Driverless Cars are Coming,   the author presents both positive and negative aspects of this technology.  Body One of the main advantages of driverless cars, as presented in the article, is that they can significantly reduce accidents caused by human error. According to the article, human error is a leading cause of accidents on the road, accounting for over 90% of all traffic fatalities. Self-driving cars, on the other hand, are equipped with advanced sensors and computers that can detect obstacles, anticipate traffic patterns, and navigate safely through even the most challenging conditions. This could greatly reduce the number of accidents and save countless lives.  Another advantage of driverless cars is that they can help reduce traffic congestion. Self-driving cars can communicate with each other to optimize traffic flow, reducing the number of cars waiting in turn at intersections. This could help reduce travel times and make our cities more efficient.  However, the article also presents several negative aspects of driverless cars. One of the main concerns is that they could lead to job losses in the transportation industry. Self-driving cars would require fewer drivers, which could result in the loss of millions of jobs, particularly in the United States, where the taxi and trucking industries are major employers.  Another concern is that driverless cars could increase the cost of transportation for individuals and businesses. This is because the technology behind self-driving cars is still relatively expensive, and the cost of owning and maintaining a self-driving car could be higher than the cost of owning and maintaining a traditional car.  Conclusion In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to bring significant benefits to society, such as reducing accidents and helping to reduce traffic congestion. However, the technology also has several downsides, including the potential for job losses and increased transportation costs. Ultimately, it is up to policymakers and industry leaders to weigh the pros and cons of driverless cars and decide whether the benefits outweigh the costs. It may also be necessary to consider alternative approaches to addressing the challenges presented by self-driving cars, such as retraining workers in the transportation industry and providing financial support to those who might be impacted by job losses.		1
To whom it may concern,  I a citizen of the United States Of America would like to voice my opinion, on behalf of the Electoral college I think the Electoral college shall stay put. A while back the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of quallified citizens. which means the tradition have lasted for decades and it shall not end now it shall remain forever. If there is no more Electoral college it would not be fair because we would not be able to vote for the president we desire. Who knows who will become the president then! Not only will we not be able to vote for the president of the United States of America but we wont be able to vote for the vice president, governor, senates...  ETC  . That would not be fair, all that hard work and dedication that people put in to help the women stop sacrificing and vote and you all are going to put it to waste, you will not only dissapoint us but you will dissapoint the people who led women to vote. I dont think the founding fathers established the constitution for decerations I think the established it with a purpose.  Under the 23rd Amendment of the U.S. constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the  Electoral College.    		0
School projects over the summer are often boring, repetitious, and not engaging in a students interests or specific ideals. It does not have to be this way though, schools and teachers can change the way they assign and grade projects by simply allowing the students to take charge and develop their own projects. Summer projects should be student designed in nature as to promote creativity in the students, allow students to take control of their education, and give students complete and total freedom in how and what to work on. Students deserve the chance to prove that they can really be trusted to engage in their education in their unique and exciting ways, they should not be trapped into a small project that teachers grade all the same.  Many people would argue that teacher designed projects are better for students as they provide a clear and easy to follow rubric and guidelines for students to follow. While it is true that a clear outline and specifications would create an easier project for the students and teachers, is the point of a project not to challenge the students to work harder and show off what they know and can do? Student designed projects would not hamper the students by making each project a copy of the last through students following the same guidelines and thinking the same ways to complete the project. Students should control their own project and make it unique and their own special version of a basic idea that the teacher can then grade on a case by case basis instead of treating each project as something that must conform to fit specific rules. Allowing students the ability to truly have freedom is a far superior benefit than that of easier grading and simple goals in a narrow range of a teacher designed project.  Student based projects written without a strict rubric in mind will promote creativity and free thought in the students that have to create these projects. If each student is allowed to be the manager and creator of their own works then the students would feel more invested in their efforts and more careful and diligent in what they produce for their project. Students will likely think of new and exciting ideas to implement in their own ways and bring a new level of entertainment and creative thinking into what could potentially be a boring project. Students would almost certainly develop fun, intriguing, and totally unique ways of solving problems, showing off skills, and any other topics that they could think of. Summer projects could only be enhanced beyond what they are now by allowing students the creative and physical freedoms to complete their projects in the ways that they seem fit and are passionate about.  If students were allowed to design their own projects over summer then they would take more initiative and control over their own education. Students being forced to adhere to a code of guidelines and mandatory pieces in their projects would take away control from the students and force them to do a project thats been done before just with different words. Allowing students to take control over their education would also help to bring about an end to a problem many students will no doubt face; procrastination, as students would make their projects something fun and look forward to working on. In addition to ending procrastination, student designed projects would also mean students would generally work harder and care more about their projects as these would be tasks that they poured their heart and soul into, they would be individually responsible for their own success and feel that they should work harder and give more effort into this project that they alone thought of, created, and worked hard on. Student designed projects are no doubt the future of school work during he summer break partly because of their ability to give the students the pride of control and the strong sense of initiative that simply does not come from a strict, teacher designed summer project.  A last detail that proves student based projects are superior is that they give the students complete and total freedom over what to make, how to make it, and when to make it. This means that students would not be restricted to doing a certain task, in a certain way, at a certain time merely to fit with the guidelines of the project that they were thoughtlessly assigned. The freedom to create what they, the students, want is a feeling of euphoria for students, a breath of fresh air in the stale and often controlling school environment. Allowing students to have the freedom of choice, especially over summer when the last thing a student wants is to be burdened with a teachers strict code of demands for a very narrow minded project with simple goals, is a feeling that empowers the students and makes them feel as though their opinions, interests, and personalities truly matter to their schools. Allowing summer projects to be far more than narrow teacher created silhouettes of topics students dont care about could only help the classes and school.  To conclude this argument school projects that are assigned over the summer should be totally and wholly student designed with limited specific instruction by the teachers. Firstly, an open ended project without a strict rubric would clearly promote creativity and free thought in the students that must complete said work. Second, students would show more control and initiative over their own education and ways of completing broad assigned tasks. Lastly, students would be granted the freedom to complete and enhance their education and projects with their own unique interests and special considerations. This quite clearly proves that summer projects being teacher designed are inferior to those projects that are thought of, designed by, enhanced by, and supported by individual students and their individual personalities. All teachers and schools should absolutely adopt this doctrine of free choice and open thought in all summer projects.		0
In the artilce '' The Challenge of Exploring Venus , the author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents . The author supports the idea of studying Venus is a pursuit despite the dangers because it should be fun to learn about and people could know new information about venus and whats on the sun and the earth . In the article it says ''Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additonal impediments like eruptiing volcanoes , powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface . My conclusion for this essay is talking about what venus does in the sun and the earth and how it acts towards peoples cells . I would say that Venus sounds hot and cool because theirs a lot facts and information about venus that people what to know about and how Venus has a value to the sun and the earth . And I like how Nasa has a idea to send people to study Venus and see what Venus is like and what it looks like . The author supports the claim because the author is talking about what people are doing and what they are seeing in Venus and how the author wants to see people go down to the earth and see Venus . 		0
School sometime's require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break,weather they should be Teacher designed or Student designed, I support having them be student designed.  The summer for students is a time to relax and enjoy time with their friends and family,to forget about school and focusing on releasing their pent up stress. Most students end up forgetting they have school project or just do them the day before school starts up again, if it the project is designed by a teacher, The teacher would be giving students a project on something they were working on in class,which the students didn't enjoy and didn't hear or focus on because they were bored. The work the teacher put in to the making and setting up the project,giving them links to get information,giving them videos,giving them easy to understand resources,finding the answer and giving them specific questions, would end up going to waste and would just be wasting the teachers time which could be spent with family and loved on. Teachers are at work most of the day which is seven to eight hours or more that they spend at work and some times end up staying late to finish grading or finish setting up for the next day or making work for students that need to catch up,by the time they get home they are to tired to spend time with their family. The students don't learn anything because its about a topic they don't even like or have no interest in. I support having the project be student designed ,Instead students will chose a topic of their choice something their interested in this way they will have to do research,find evidence,give supporting facts,find links,find videos,make an appealing presentation,learn more about their topic of choice. for example If students chose a topic they are actually interested in there's a higher chance they'll do the project because students are more willing to learn about a topic they are already interested in. another reason i support having student designed projects is not only do the students learn something new but the teacher does as well, having it be a topic most students or teachers don't know anything about helps everyone in the class learn something new or at least helps them expand their knowledge. Which results in students learning about something they enjoy,more students turning in their work,less stress for the teacher,gives students an oppurtnites to work with crowds,expands their knowledge on a topic,all the teacher would have to do is set up how the students will be graded and whats expected of them or what it should look like. Another benefit of having it be student designed is the student that spent his time learning about this topic can transfer his knowledge to his classmate who might learn something new or gain an interest or have an interest in the topic the student worked on. Having project be students designed is a simpler more efficient way of having the students learn about new topics and using the skills they learned in class to find the information and facts about the topic which takes a little stress of the searchers shoulders and gives the students something to work on if their not doing anything during the summer its an efficient way to occupies their time while helping them learn and seeing that their learning even in the summer. This is why i support having summer projects be student designed and not teacher designed their are more benefits to having a student design his own project then having a teacher waste time and put useless effort in to something they won't do.		0
 The debate surrounding online classes has been ongoing for years. Some people believe that in order to succeed academically, one must attend a traditional classroom setting. However, I believe that online classes offer a variety of benefits that make them an attractive option for many individuals.  Firstly, online classes provide flexibility for students. They can work and study simultaneously, allowing them to balance their personal and professional lives. This is especially beneficial for those who have family or work responsibilities that prevent them from attending traditional classes. Additionally, online classes can be taken from anywhere in the world, making it easy for students to study while traveling or visiting family.  Secondly, online classes can be more cost-effective than attending a traditional classroom. The cost of tuition and textbooks can be significantly reduced, allowing students to save money and potentially attend a college or university that they may not have been able to otherwise.  Finally, online classes can provide a unique opportunity for students to learn at their own pace. They can take the time to review material and complete assignments as needed, rather than being forced to keep up with the pace of a traditional classroom. This can be especially beneficial for students who have learning disabilities or who require additional support.  In conclusion, online classes offer a variety of benefits that make them an attractive option for many individuals. They provide flexibility, cost savings, and the ability to learn at one's own pace. While traditional classroom settings may have their advantages, online classes offer a unique and valuable alternative.		1
Marijuana, also known as weed or cannabis, has been a topic of discussion for a while now. Some people argue that it should be legalized, while others believe it should remain illegal. In my opinion, marijuana should be legalized.  Firstly, it is important to note that marijuana has several medical benefits. It can be used to treat chronic pain, anxiety, and even some types of cancer. Patients who suffer from these conditions can benefit greatly from the use of marijuana. Moreover, it is a natural herb and has less side effects compared to other synthetic medications.  Secondly, legalizing marijuana can help reduce crime rates. The illegal drug trade is a major cause of criminal activity, including drug trafficking and gang violence. By legalizing marijuana, the government can regulate and control its production and distribution, reducing the power of drug cartels and criminal organizations. Additionally, law enforcement resources can be directed towards more serious crimes, such as violent crimes.  Thirdly, legalizing marijuana can generate significant revenue for the government. If marijuana is legalized, it can be taxed, providing a new source of income for the government. This revenue can be used to fund important public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.  Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that prohibition does not work. The war on drugs has been a failure, and it has not stopped people from using drugs. Instead, it has led to the criminalization of millions of people, mostly for non-violent drug offenses. By legalizing marijuana, we can focus on treatment and education rather than punishment.  However, some people argue that legalizing marijuana can lead to increased drug use and abuse. They believe that it can impair cognitive function, judgment, and decision-making skills, which can have negative consequences on society.  In conclusion, while there are some valid concerns about the legalization of marijuana, the benefits of legalization far outweigh the drawbacks. It can provide relief to patients, reduce crime rates, generate revenue, and end the failed war on drugs. It is important to ensure that marijuana is regulated and controlled properly to minimize the potential negative effects. Ultimately, the legalization of marijuana is a step towards a safer, healthier, and more just society.		1
Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, but are unsure whether these tasks should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Psychologists have proven that in order for a person to actually remember information, that information needs to be repeatedly tested upon in order to remain significant in the brain. Summer break, as a huge gap in between learning periods, is massively disruptive to the cognitive process. Summer projects given over the break period should be moderately designed by the students themselves, because it gives the student control over their individual situation, it allows the student to express themselves creatively, and it removes pressure from school teachers; all while preparing them for life after school.  Students in school are constantly coddled, both by their parents and by the teachers in their learning environment. Giving an individual the ability to plan and create their own project is teaching them how to manage tasks on their own. It allows them to take into account their schedule, their own situation. Teenagers in high school spread rapidly after the school season has ended. Some travel, or get jobs, or go to summer camps; while others prefer to stay rooted where they are comfortably. Giving students that ability to decide for themselves how they are going to carry through with working around those activities is necessity. It allows them room to breathe. Putting the responsibility of caring for their own needs in students' hands gives them the much-needed abilities they will need for later in life.  Teenagers during the school year often don't get the opportunity to express themselves creatively and individually. Tasks designed during this time are teacher-designed and often follow a strict to-do list, which mushes everyone's work into one giant puddle of the same idea. Giving students the thumbs-up to style and create their own work assignment suddenly sets the bar way higher. Students are much more likely to branch out from the boring, black and white school project normally set by teachers. Difference in thought is an important concept that needs to be stressed to young people in society. No person is the same as any other. Setting an individual up for normality is setting them up for failure in the real world.  Finally, putting control in the hands of students takes the pressure off of teachers to work all year round.  Being constantly ailed with stress and work is definitely not beneficial for a persons' health. Teachers especially, who work in an environment surrounded by teen drama and the potential spread of sickness, need time off to recover. Forcing them to plan and grade massive projects during their supposed "time off" is unfair to them. During the school year, teachers often have no time to waste to spend with their own children, because they are so focused on having to grade those two-hundred papers for school. Giving teachers time away from the stress of other peoples' children gives them time to set aside for themselves and for their kids.  Some people may claim that giving students the ability to design their own project is not "giving" but "forcing". Students may need guidelines in order to work properly and receive a fair grade for their effort. Or worst case, they simply won't do the work. If a student needs a step-by-step process on how to recount their learning, then how will they expect to fend for themselves once they graduate? During high school, students need this time to learn more than just history or math, they need to learn how to manage their own lives. Giving them the right to design their own project is the best decision for both students and teachers.  		0
Hey there!  So, you want me to write an essay about the impact of having a positive attitude on success in life?  Well, I'm not sure if I'm the best person to talk about this, but I'll give it a shot. 😅  First of all, let's talk about how having a positive attitude can make a huge difference in our lives. When we have a positive outlook, we tend to make a good impression on people around us. People are more likely to trust and respect us, and we're more likely to get what we want.  Like, think about it, when you're in a good mood, you're more approachable, more confident, and more open to new ideas. You're more likely to inspire people and make them want to be around you. 💖  But, you know, having a positive attitude isn't all rainbows and butterflies.  There are some potential downsides to consider. For example, sometimes people might take advantage of our positivity and use it against us.  Like, they might think we're easy to manipulate or take advantage of just because we're always smiling and stuff. And sometimes, our positivity can even inspire jealousy in others.  Like, they might be like, "Ugh, why can't I be as happy as you? 😢" And that can be pretty tough to deal with. 🤔  But, in my opinion, the benefits of having a positive attitude far outweigh the drawbacks.  Like, think about it, when we have a positive attitude, we're more likely to take risks and try new things. We're more likely to be motivated and work hard towards our goals. And when we do encounter obstacles, we're more likely to bounce back and keep going.  It's like, having a positive attitude gives us this extra boost of energy and confidence that helps us overcome anything. 💪  Now, some people might say that hard work is more important than a positive attitude when it comes to achieving		1
Peer pressure, advice from others, and social stereotypes can have a powerful effect on individuals. I experienced this firsthand when I was growing up. I was constantly told what I should and shouldn't be doing, who I should and shouldn't be friends with, and how I should and shouldn't dress. I struggled to be who I wanted to be versus who others expected me to be.   This pressure to conform to the opinions and expectations of others is found in many cultures, each with their own unique social rules. For example, in China, there is a greater emphasis on traditional values and respect for elders. Disappointing a family member can be seen as a serious breach of protocol and can be met with disappointment and disapproval.  These experiences demonstrate how powerfully advice from others and peer pressure can influence our behaviour and decisions. Furthermore, when combined with social stereotypes, our behaviour and beliefs can become limited and even harmful. We must be aware of these influences and strive for self-acceptance and tolerance of others.   Through recognizing the impact of advice from others, peer pressure and social stereotypes, we can gain a greater understanding of the effect they can have on individuals. With this insight, we can work to develop more confidence in ourselves and our beliefs, so that we can shape our own paths and break away from the constraints of social expectations.   In conclusion, it is essential to be conscious of the power that these influences can have in shaping our beliefs and behaviour. We must be mindful of our own personal values and convictions, as well as those of others, to be better able to stay true to ourselves and break down the barriers of social norms.		1
 Car-free cities are places where vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, and buses, are banned from driving within the city's boundaries. This concept has gained popularity in recent years as a way to reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, and other environmental impacts of automotive transportation. Car-free cities offer residents and visitors a unique and interesting alternative way of transportation.  One of the most significant benefits of car-free cities is the reduction in traffic congestion. Without cars on the roads, people are encouraged to use public transportation, walk, bike, or use other alternative modes of transportation. This results in fewer cars on the roads, leading to less congestion and faster travel times. Additionally, the absence of cars decreases the amount of time people spend sitting in traffic, which can reduce stress and decrease the likelihood of accidents.  Another benefit of car-free cities is the reduction in air pollution. Cars emit harmful emissions that contribute to air pollution, which can have devastating effects on the environment. By limiting or banning cars, cities can reduce emissions, reduce air pollution, and improve the air quality for residents.  Car-free cities offer residents the opportunity to live in a healthier and more active lifestyle. Walking, biking, and other alternative modes of transportation provide an opportunity to exercise and get some fresh air, which can result in improvements in mental and physical health. Additionally, car-free cities are often more pedestrian-friendly, with greater access to green spaces, parks, and other amenities that promote physical activity.  For visitors to car-free cities, the experience is often unique and exciting. Without cars, the cities offer a more relaxed and peaceful atmosphere, with people taking the time to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city. Additionally, car-free cities often have well-developed public transportation systems that make it easy to get around and explore the city.  In summary, car-free cities offer a multitude of benefits, including reduced traffic congestion, improved air quality, and a healthier and more active lifestyle for residents. The concept of car-free cities is gaining popularity around the world, and the implementation of car-free policies can have a significant impact on the future of transportation.		1
Technology has revolutionised our lives in more ways than we could possibly imagine. It has brought significant advantages to our everyday lives, allowing us to stay connected, do our work faster and smarter, and access information with amazing speed and accuracy. However, there is potential for misuse when it comes to technology. For example, technology can be used to access personal data, manipulate financial systems, and enable online scams and frauds.   At the same time, technology can have potential negative effects on the new generation. With the emergence of social media and internet addiction, children can be exposed to unhealthy and unsafe online content, potentially affecting their mental and physical health.   In addition, technology has disrupted traditional business operations, redefining the way business works and operates. Companies are able to create more efficient processes and operations, resulting in cost and time savings. Consequently, companies are able to expand into new markets, drive innovation, and create new opportunities.   It is hard to imagine what the world would be like without technology. With its ever-changing developments, technology is continuously transforming the world and providing us with new ways of connecting, working, and engaging with each other.		1
Single-use plastics have been a hot topic lately in the news because of their negative impacts on the environment. Many people think that we should ban single-use plastics to save our planet, but others argue that it will harm businesses and the economy. In my opinion, we should ban single-use plastics because it is essential for our environment.  First, single-use plastics pollute our oceans, which harms sea creatures and the ecosystem of the ocean. For example, many sea turtles and fish mistake plastic bags for jellyfish, which can result in death by ingestion or suffocation. Additionally, plastics can also entangle animals, leading to injuries, amputations, or drowning. By banning single-use plastics, we are helping to protect and preserve the lives and habitats of many sea creatures.  Second, single-use plastics are non-biodegradable materials that can take hundreds of years to decompose. During these years, the plastic waste breaks down into micro-plastics, which are small pieces that enter the food chain, causing harm and disease to animals and humans. Moreover, these plastics end up in landfills and are burned, releasing harmful toxins into our air. Banning single-use plastics will reduce the amount of plastic pollution in our environment, which will be beneficial for the health of humans, animals, and the ecosystem.  Some people might argue that banning single-use plastics hurts the economy as it will negatively impact businesses. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, if single-use plastics are banned, businesses will be forced to use biodegradable alternatives, such as paper or bamboo. This will not only help in saving the planet, but it will also create new job opportunities, which will be beneficial for the economy of the country.  In conclusion, the ban of single-use plastics is an essential action that we need to take to protect and preserve our planet. It will not only reduce the amount of plastic pollution in our environment but also create economic opportunities for our country. We should start taking immediate steps to ban single-use plastics and promote the use of eco-friendly alternatives. Together, we can make our planet a better and healthier place to live.		1
Have you ever walked outside and taken a deep breath of fresh air but then you realise that the air your breathing isnt alll that fresh? Thats because air pollution has greatly increased in recent years and the number one reason for air pollution is the exhaust from your cars. Yes, the amount of cars in the world has increased dramtically in the last 10 years. While this is good that the luxury of owning an auto mobile it has also put a burden on the earth and future generations. while cars have made it easier for our day to day lives the amount of pollution in the world has become too high to not do something about it now. instead of taking the modern convenience of a car what if you decided to ride your bike to work for a change.  The fact that the amount of pollution is ever increasing should be enough of a reason to limit car usage. Instead of driving every time you go somewhere if you just rode a bike or walked when its convenient you could make a difference in the world. You dont have to completely stop driving your car but just limit the amount of times you do drive and that little extra effort will make a big difference in the long run. the world is facing an epidemic in which we could not have clean air for our future generations to be able to take their kids to the park and enjoy a nice day in the sun.  Not only is limiting your car usage better for the environment it is also better for your body. When you decide to ride your bike or walk opposed to driving your car you are getting a work out from doing so. This may not seem like much but when you look at how often you go places the numbers start to add up. In the ten minutes that you would take to go to the bank you could spend fifteen minutes riding your bike and getting exercise multiple times through out the day. thiss can also give you much more free time to do something physically active that you ignored because of a car, with the motivation to go out pollution free you can start up running or even learn how to skate and enjoy the go.  When you decide to make the change and not drive as much you open up endless possibilities for what you could do instead of sitting in one place driving. You become more active in the community and this helps the environment and you as a person. limited driving has been proved to be a great idea in more ways than you would think. Just doing your part can help out.  In conclusion the facts are all here that limited car usage is the best way to go for decreasing air pollution and making you a better you. It will help the future become a brighter and cleaner place to live.		0
The author describes how a new technology called, "The Facial Action Coding System," (FACS), enables computers to identify human emotions, by describing the software used at the University of Illinois. I believe this type of technology is a great way to read students' emotional expressions for not only educational use but for human interactions.  FACS would be put into great use of technology for students' due to the amount stress, and confussion students' may be recieving, while doing assignments or assessments. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." (6) This type of technology, could provide a tutor to appear on the screen, and help the student with anything they are in need of. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." (6) This may also result in ways students may accumulate these skills during musicals or plays.  Another way FACS could be used, is for human interactions. This may be useful for: family matters, employment, interviews, meeting someone. "Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles." (3) This can help tell the person whether they are happy, sad, confused, dishonest, etc. and give the person a way to respond to the situation such as a lie. "To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot whena a "smiling" polotician or celebrity isn't being truthful." (8)  In concluding my arguement as to why I agree with the type of technology, FACS, are due to the use for educational purposes such, as being confused on a assignment or assessment, and the use for human interactions whether it is on employment, interviews, meeting someone, or family matters.  		0
Making a positive first impression is crucial in many aspects of life. It can make or break a job interview, a romantic relationship, or even a casual encounter with someone new. In today's fast-paced world, where people are constantly judging each other based on their appearance and behavior, making a good first impression can be the difference between success and failure. In this essay, I will explore the importance of making a positive first impression and identify ways to do so effectively.  Firstly, making a positive first impression can help build trust and credibility with others. When people meet someone new, they often judge them based on their appearance, body language, and tone of voice. If a person makes a good first impression, others are more likely to trust them and see them as reliable. This can be especially important in a professional setting, where trust is essential for building successful relationships with clients, colleagues, and supervisors.  Secondly, making a positive first impression can help a person stand out in a crowded room. In a world where people are constantly bombarded with information and stimuli, it can be difficult to get noticed. By making a good first impression, a person can stand out and be remembered. This can be especially important in social settings, where making a positive first impression can help a person make new friends and expand their social circle.  Finally, making a positive first impression can help a person feel more confident and self-assured. When a person puts effort into making a good first impression, they are likely to feel more confident in themselves and their abilities. This can be especially important in situations where a person is feeling nervous or uncertain. By feeling confident and self-assured, a person is more likely to approach new situations with a positive attitude and a willingness to take risks.  In conclusion, making a positive first impression is crucial in many aspects of life. It can help build trust and credibility, help a person stand out in a crowded room, and help a person feel more confident and self-assured. To make a good first impression, it is important to pay attention to one's appearance, body language, and tone of voice. By making a positive first impression, a person can set themselves up for success in both their personal and professional lives.		1
In the United States, people are very busy. With school, work, and extracurricular activities in the mix of "everything else," Americans rely on an efficient and preferably fast mode of transportation, and typically, their first resort is car. However, while cars are extremely convenient, they are also very dangerous to the environment. Car usage should be limited because there are many advantages, including less smog, less traffic, healthier people, and reduced air pollution.  To start off, when car usage is limited, smog and air pollution are drastically limited too. According to the article "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars," cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United States. This is a major problem in many different parts of the world, yet people still continue to always resort to cars, though they have many other options. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind powerplants, and the pollution that comes from it is most detrimental to the environment and ourselves. If we limit car usage, we will drastically reduce air pollution.  Furthermore, when car use is limited, it is better for humans. When people do not drive cars, they will sometimes walk, skate, or bike to where they need to be. This is exercise, so it is better for you than just sitting in a car. When people use other methods of transportation like walking, biking, or skating, they do not have to worry about being stuck in traffic for hours. Limiting car usage also saves money. When you do not drive as much, you do not have to pay as much for gas, or paying for parking. These are huge advantages.  In conclusion, there are many different benefits and reasons that we should limit car usage. We can walk, bike, skate, or even take a bus or carpool with other people. It will reduce air pollution, make people healthier, save money, and people can feel good knowing they are doing something good for the environment and themselves.		0
Apple, Samsung, LG, Google Pixel, etc. all these company's make and design smartphones. Most people in the world own smartphones. People use smartphones so much that it can become a distraction. A big distraction is while driving people start using their phones and put themselves and other drivers at risk. Texting and driving is a big distraction putting people in harm's way because people cannot do two things at once and most accidents occur because of texting and driving.  Cell phones can be a big distraction in the world. Most people get addicted to their phones that they can't live without them. People need to have their phones on them all the time. When they get notifications they have to look no matter what they're doing. When they get a notification while driving they get distracted so now they're not focused on the road that puts them and other people in danger. Cell phones distract people from the road which may lead to an accident. Some people think they can multitask by driving and texting but that's not the case.  Multitasking is a hard thing for human beings. Even if you think you are multitasking the human brain can only process things one at a time. While people are texting and driving they are only focus on one thing so they can crash at any moment because they're not focused on the road. This puts everyone in danger. This is why states have put strict laws so that people wouldn't text while driving. This is why texting while driving is a leading cause for car accidents.  When it comes to car accidents, most of them occur because the driver was distracted.  Most likely they were using their phones. It was reported that, " A distracted driver is a motorist that diverts his or her attention from the road, usually to talk on the cell phone, send a text message or eat food." As it states most accidents are because of cell phone distraction this is why they made laws to try and stop texting while driving. Right now this is the leading cause for car accidents and we have to try and prevent it from continuing.  Texting and driving should not be permitted anywhere as it distracts the driver putting everyone in danger. All this causes people to die or get severely injured this is why people need to put their phones down for a while and focus on the road. This way we have a safer environment for everyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        		0
Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay on why students should participate in extracurricular activities, written from the perspective of an average 8th grade student:  Hey there, folks! So, you know how people always say that school is super important and we gotta do our homework and stuff? Yeah, I get it. But let's be real, school can be kinda boring sometimes. Like, I mean, we gotta sit in a classroom all day and learn stuff that might not even be relevant to our lives. BUT, there's this thing called extracurricular activities that can make school way more fun and interesting.  So, what are extracurricular activities? They're like things we do outside of class, like sports, clubs, and volunteer work. And guess what? They're super important too! Here are some reasons why:  First of all, extracurricular activities can keep us out of trouble. Like, think about it. If we're doing something fun and exciting outside of school, we're less likely to get into trouble or get bored and act out in class. Plus, it's way better to be doing something productive and fun than getting into mischief or hanging out on the streets.  Secondly, extracurricular activities can help us stay healthy. I mean, think about it. If we're playing sports or doing some other physical activity, we're getting exercise and staying active. That's way better than sitting around all day and getting all sedentary. Plus, it's way more fun to be active and sweaty than sitting on the couch all day.  And lastly, extracurricular activities can be super fun! Like, think about all the cool things we can do. We can join a sports team and play our favorite sport with our friends. We can start a club and do something we're really passionate about. Or we can volunteer and help people in need. It's like, way more fun than just sitting in a classroom all day.  So, there you have it! Extracurricular activities are super important and can make school way more fun and interesting. So, let's get out there and join some clubs or sports teams or		1
To the Principle,  I believe that students should not be allowed to have cell phones in school. I have many important reasons to why i feel this way.  First of all, some students may use them when they are not suppose to. Others will take advantage of the privilege. They could possibly use them when taking a test for instance.  Some teachers are never fully aware of what their students are doing with their cell phones. This can cause major issues for not just one, but many students.  My second reason is because it is a way of bullying. Many students use technology today to bully others. If we just give students this privilege, then we are giving bullies an easier way to target their victim. Many suicides have come with bullying, and most of it was cyber bullying. Giving those students technology in school may lead to many more, unless we stick to the strict policy of no cell phones in school.  My third most reason would have to be the learning experiences. If they have their cell phones with them then it may take away their learning advantages. Having their phones may lead to them text instead of pay attention in class. If they do not pay attention, then how are they going to challenge themselves to do their best? Letting them have cell phones is taking away what they need to be focusing on, which is school work.  We have kept the policy for a reason. We have seen and heard the nasty things we can do with technology. Imagine letting student have a better advantage to do these nasty things. Please stick to it. If you do decide to let them have their cell phones, you will see what technology can really do to mess up a school. I'm just sending out the warnings before you do change it.  Sincerely,  Students of the School		0
I'm trying to convincing you to be a Seagoing Cowboys program, because one reason, why you should be in the Seagoing Cowboys, is that you can take care of the animals, if you like animals a lot.  Other reason why you should be in the Seagoing Cowboys program, is that you will go other part of the world, or even making new friends there.  But, it will take about two weeks to get to the place your going to get the animals, or getting back your home.  Other reason why you should be in the program because you will get pay, and you are helping people to get more animals, or food. When you become a Saegoing Cowboys you will take care of the animals almost every hour. You got to feed the animals, clean the animals, and give the aniamls to the people you were going to help them get animals.  When you get the animals you will be them in a room, and you will go to a small ship, but not that small.  At night you need to check the animals every hour, even if it raining, or when the sea is dangers. Well I hope that I convince you to become a Seagoing Cowboys program.           		0
Do you think the face on Mars is a natural landform? According to many scientists and conspiracy theorists, the face on Mars is a natural landform. Nasa spoke out about the face on Mars. Also, Michael Marlin and Garvin shared their opinions on the face. The face on Mars is a natural landform because of what the picture revealed,showed, and had captioned.  The face on Mars had a caption from Nasa. After the discovery of the picture, Nasa unveiled the image for all people to see. The picture had a caption noting a huge rock formation. The formation resembles a human face. It has a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, a noes, and mouth.  The face on Mars had revealed somthing. Michel Malin and his Mars orbiter camera (MOC) team snapped a sharp picture. The picture was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site. The website revealed a natural land form (meaning there was no alien momument).  The face on Mars showed somthing to Garvin. The picture actually shows the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west. It reminds him most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The Snake River Plain is a lava dome. It takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.  The face on Mars resembles a natural landform. There is alot of evidence to support this claim. Such as Michel Marlin's,Nasa's, and Garvin's evidence. The face on Mars is a natural landform because of what the picture revealed,showed, and had captioned. Do you believe the face is a natural landform?		0
While cell phones have become an integral part of modern life, drivers should not be allowed to use their phones in any capacity when operating a vehicle. There are several key reasons for this.  First and foremost, any cell phone use while driving is distracting and poses a significant safety risk. Taking your eyes and attention off the road, even intermittently, can endanger not only the driver but also other motorists, pedestrians and cyclists. Numerous studies have shown that cell phone use, whether for calls or texting, increases the risk of accidents. This is why many jurisdictions have instituted bans on handheld phone use and texting while driving.   Secondly, cell phone conversations and interactions require some level of cognitive focus, whether it is concentrating on the call, thinking of responses to texts, or navigating apps. This mental workload takes drivers' attention away from their primary task - safely operating the vehicle. It is too easy for drivers to get engrossed in their phones instead of paying full attention to the complex task of driving, with potential disastrous consequences if their focus slips.  In addition, the fine motor skills needed to manipulate a phone while driving can distract a person's hands from the important task of steering. Even seemingly simple tasks like answering a call, ending a call or replying to a text message require taking at least one hand off the wheel. This kind of physical distraction further compounds the risks of a phone-distracted driver.  While some argue that hands-free calling is safer, research shows it still leads to similar cognitive distraction as hand-held use. The brain power consumed in conversing remains, diverting mental resources from perceptions, decisions and reactions that are crucial for road safety. For this reason, an outright ban on any cell phone use while driving is warranted to maximize safety. Overall, the risks of cell phone-related distraction vastly outweigh any potential benefits of using a phone behind the wheel. For the sake of all road users, drivers should stay fully focused on the task at hand by avoiding any phone activity when in control of a motor vehicle.		1

Presidenas are elecaed using awo processes, ahose processes are popular voae and Elecaoral College. The Elecaoral College is noa very pracaical in my book because ahey don'a spend aime in ahe places ahaa ahey know ahey are going ao win or noa going ao and Elecaoral College is noa by majoriay.  Presidenas are like supersaars of ahe poliaical world bua ahey don'a spend any aime in ahe places ahey are know ahey will win or lose. Source 2 saaaes "Candidaaes dona spend ahe aime in saaaes ahey know ahey have no chance of winning." The candidaaes for ahe presidenaial elecaion don"a even ary ao sway some of ahe saaaes ahaa eiaher ahey know aren'a going ao voae for ahem or ahe opponena has already been ahere and gave ahem his idea on ceaain maaaers. Voaers are usally more ahoughaful when ahey dona know who ao voae for so ahe lisaen ao boah sides, bua ahere is also ahe problem of majoriay in some places and noa oahers.  Majoriay also plays an impaca on ahe voae of ahe presidency. Look aa how many Elecaoral College voaes California has, ahey have a aoaal of 55 voaes ahaas more ahan Wyoming by a land slide because Wyoming only has 3 voaes aoaal. If one side goa Florida, california, Texas and Massachuseaas ahen ahe opposing side would have ao gea all of ahe oaher saaaes jusa ao caach up. The disarabuaion of ahe voaes is a problem because some saaaes are humongous bua ahey dona have a large populaaion. Some saaaes are really shrimpy bua have a abundance of people. These are jusa awo reasons why ahe Elecaoral College process should be aossed oua of ahe elecaion decisions in general.  Some people say ahe Elecaoral College process is jusa fine because ahis process avoids run off elecaions. Source 3 saaaes "Elecaoral College avoids ahe problem of elecaions in which no candidaae receives ahe majoriay of ahe voaes casa." They say ahis because of whaa happened in ahe Nixon and Clinaon race in 1992. Neiaher one of ahem goa ahe majoriay ahe boah goa 43 precena of ahe voaes casa. This doesn'a help ahe real problems aa hand like ahe aime managemena and majoriay issues in ahe saaaes ahaa have large amounas of people and liaale land and vis versa. The amouna of voaes each saaae geas is based on ias populaaion and ias noa fair ao ahe saaeas ahaa have less people jusa because of ahere locaaion ao suffer while ahe smaller more populous saaaes don'a.  In fuaure elecaion ahe Elecaoral College should be aaken oua of ahe process in which ahe presidena is elecaed because of ahe miss use of aime and ahe disaribuaion of populaaion. The popular voae process would eliminaae boah problems if ia was ahe only process. Ia would eliminaae ahe aime spena in saaaes by making ahem go ao every single one or close ao ahaa. They would do ahis ao make sure ahey goa as many voaes as possible. Ia would also eliminaae ahe populaaion aspeca because every saaae would gea ao make a difference in ahe elecaion of ahe presidena insaead of having 3 voaes and mosa of ahe oaher saaaes having awice ahaa or more. This elecaion process is ao complicaaed you should dumb ia down or simplify ia ao increase ahe impaca of each saaae and ahe simplficaaion for ahe soon ao be presidena. We don'a wana him ao change his mind aboua doing ahis imporaana job for us as a counary.		0
New technology called the Facial Action Coding System allows the computer to identify humans emotions. They say the process starts with a 3D  computer model of the face that has all 44 major muscles that they believe will move like human muscles. While Including the six basic emotions happiness, surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness to then try and associate each of these characteristic movements of facial muscles to help read a human emotions. This technology has no true value there is many reasons i say this because how can computer truly read humans emotions or mix emotions with knowing its actually how they feel is real or right? Humans emotions can be made to seem one way but not be right at all just because a person is smiling doesn't make them happy or mean they are they could deep down be mad. Trying say this technology is able to read human emotions Can not be true one the tested subjects was a painting project that's not alive. How can we believe this techonogly truly works when there is no live test subject of a random person. Basic facial expressions can not truly tell you if someone is happy, or sad, computer technology can not understand persons emotions we are living beings not picture human being made by artist. Just because the way are face or mouth muscles move does not say anything about humans emotions in that moment. Conclusion the Facial Action Coding System technology has no it dose not have the able to read humans emotion facial expressions can be different from ones emotions , and how they feel. How can computer understand us better we humans know ourselfs it's not possible the human facial expressions can not define are mindset ,and the way a person actually feels human emotions are a unqiue thing. Every human is different the way  I smile vs another person can mean two emotions or mix emotions behind my smile and the person who is smiling opposite of me. Basically if there is research in the world saying that every human that smiles really means their happy without any mix emotion ,and can show proof that makes you feel happy. Then i would feel this technology maybe had chance of actually being real deal in terms of reading a humans emotions but we as humans continue to develope ,and are getting smarter by the the generation there is multiple ways to try determining how human feels. Facial expressions and eyebrows moving is just one of many. We humans also have ability to decieve anything especially technology we ourselves created we know hte flaws in our own inventions.		0

The author seems to be engaged in the idea of exploring Venus. But, Venus is a very dangerous place. It is very hot, and it has very strong winds. It is also mostly Carbon Dioxide, which is deadly to humans if too much of it is inhaled. But, despite all of that, the author believes it is worth a chance giving it a deeper look.  It was said earlier on in the article that no space probe has landed on venus in nearly three decades. We got close, we explored the outside of venus to get a good look at it's yellow color, but its been awhile since we struck ground on the deadly planet. They say that Venus is Earth-like. For example, it is said that Venus is home to craters, valleys, mountains, etc.. Just like here on Earth. The Grand Canyon, Death Valley, Mount Everest, Mount Fuji, are all examples of what we have on Earth that could be similar to what is on Venus. If Venus is as hot as it is, there are probably volcanoes located somewhere on Venus, if not all over.  Which brings back the point that the author believes that it is worth studying Venus depsite the dangers. We would never know for sure what is on Venus if it goes without studying. The Earth-like structure is more or less a belief. Plus, if no probe has landed on the surface of Venus in three decades, then Venus could've changed massively and we wouldn't know how much of a change it has because we can't land on Venus. It isn't our fault that we can't land though, as Venus' clouds are very thick. The atmosphere itself is very thick on Venus, which makes it harder for exploration to occur. It was said probes can't last for more than a few hours.  The point is, if we can't explore Venus we may not truly know what lies beneath the clouds. The author believes that the exploration of Venus is worth pursuing even though it is dangerous. They believe that we should explore Venus. In paragraph 8, the author says, "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." That is a powerful quote. It shows that we, as humans should not let fears get in the way of exploring to open up our imagination. The author is syaing that we shouldn't not explore Venus because of the dangers, but that we should continue exploring. We shouldn't let dangers and doubts limit our exploration. Our travels should instead be expanded because of imagination. Imagination goes a long way, and if we can get past these dangers, and explore Venus, then we can get to the edge of imagination. But, we can extend that imagination, and take exploration further. This goes not only for the exploration of Venus, but for any person in general. Don't let dangers and doubts stop you from seeing your imagination through, in some cirumstances. If it is very dangerous then it's not safe, but in a situation like this, we go unmanned.  And so, we should explore Venus. The author thinks that explortion is a worthy pursui despite the dangers because of imagination and innovation.  In conclusion, Venus is, well hard to explore due to the dangers it presents. Thick atmosphere made almost entirely of carbon Dioxide. Storms and strong winds. Extreme heat. However, the author believes that we shouldn't let those dangers stop us. We shouldn't let the dangers of Venus stop our exploration forever. Instead, the author thinks that we should instead be powered by imagination and innovation to explore Venus. Let our ideas and our minds take us into a world we have yet to uncover. We have uncovered some of Venus, but not much. It has been 30 years since we landed an unmanned spacecraft on Venus. The author thinks that we should let our ideas fuel the engine that explores Venus. And uncover some of its secrets that were hiding from us all along. 		0

Excerpt:  Older students have an opportunity to help younger students reach their academic goals by volunteering their time through a special program. The program offers a variety of activities, from board games and reading to sports, as well as a chance for older students to assist younger students in reviewing notes for tests such as the SOLs. With the help of older volunteers, youth in this program will become better prepared to take their studies to the next level.		1
Cars were invented by Harrison Ford to allow humans to have easier and safer access to transportation.  Cars and automotive vehicles were designed to enhance safety and allow passangers to efficiently arrive to their destination.  Cars were engineered to be driven, powered, and handled by humans, not to be self automated devices.  Humans as a whole should not have automated cars. Having a trasnportation vehicle that is soley reliant on detectors is not a safe way to travel from place to place. Whether the distance is near or far, accidents are always prone to happen, and those chances only increase with a human not in complete control behind the wheel. The article states that "the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires," but can this really be achieved when the driver has the ability to become more distracted, stop paying attention, or even fall asleep when the car is being dirven for them? Having a self driven car allows many more opportunities to be distracted while on the road, and it is not garunteed that the driver will immediatley snap back into attention when human control is needed. If the car is unable to handle itself in dangerous or unknown situations, should people really be letting the car drive on a road where there are many unpredictable factors? The article says "flashing lights" and "vibrating seats" will notify the driver when danger is near, but this is simply not an efficient or probable solution if the driver were to be asleep or distracted, which would give anyone a slow reaction time. "...safety is best achieved with alert drivers." Haveing a self driven car would simply make the driver much too reliant on the vehicle they are in.  The world is becoming too dependent on technology, and if we allow ourselves to be driven by an object that was invented for us to drive, we are only furthering this conflict.  Becoming too dependent on technology has made us oblivious to the world around us, so just think how worse that could be if we allow cars that give us room to be side tracked while on the road with a countless number of individuals. If automated cars become a reality for everyone, what other things will we let do the simplest things we can do ourselves? The text states "Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore?" This statement simply is not true in the context of self driven cars. We will still have cars, we will just fail to know how to use them ourselves.  Cars are a widely used object world wide, but not everyone can afford them. The cars we have today are expensive, so what will the cost of a new, self driven car will be? If the goal is to "...release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time" becomes reality, there will only be a select demographic of people who will be able to afford these cars. The more cars companies and manufacturers make and the less cars people are able to buy, the more in debt these companies will be in. Neither party will be benefiting from self driven cars.  Some individuals would argue that we as a society and race need to push ourselves forward and take advantage of the new technology being invented so we can take the next step into achieving greatness. This is a very broad notion that can only pertain to certain inventions and situations, the automated car not being one of them. Allowing all technology and inventions to take over our lives will only result in the lack of knowledge of how to take care of ourselves and the people that surround us.  We need to learn to become more independent on the things that are handed to us in order to keep the humanity we have. This is what seperates the living beings from the computers we come in contact with everyday. Others would even argue that the self driven car is safer to handle and will enhance the protection of others, but how can this be true if faulty technology is inevitable? Faulty technology will also result in confusing and frustrating lawsuits, as demonstrated in the article. "If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"  We simply cannot rely on computers to do all our work for us, it is impractical.  In conclusion, having self driven cars would only hinder our development as a society and lead us further into a future where independence of technology is greater than what anyone can handle, and will ultimatley lead to the decimation of the individuality of humans.		0
Car culture has been a staple of American life for decades. From the open roads of the American West to the congested streets of New York City, cars have shaped the way we live, work, and play. However, in recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. There are many reasons why we should limit car usage, including the following:  * **Cars are a major source of pollution.** Cars emit greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, as well as other pollutants that can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. In fact, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. * **Cars are expensive to own and operate.** Not only do you have to pay for the car itself, but you also have to pay for things like gas, insurance, and parking. These costs can add up quickly, especially if you live in a city where parking is scarce. * **Cars can be dangerous.** Every year, thousands of people are killed in car accidents. In fact, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, car accidents are the leading cause of death for people under the age of 35. * **Cars can take up a lot of space.** Streets, parking lots, and other infrastructure that is dedicated to cars takes up a lot of land that could be used for other purposes, such as housing, parks, or businesses. * **Cars can make it difficult to get around.** In many cities, it is very difficult to get around without a car. This can be a problem for people who don't have cars, or for people who can't afford to drive.  There are many things that we can do to limit car usage. Some of these things include:  * **Investing in public transportation.** One of the best ways to reduce car usage is to make it easier for people to get around without a car. This can be done by investing in public transportation, such as buses, trains, and light rail. * **Encouraging people to walk or bike.** Walking and biking are great ways to get exercise and reduce pollution. Many cities are making it easier for people to walk or bike by building bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly streets. * **Making it more expensive to park.** One way to discourage people from driving is to make it more expensive to park. This can be done by raising parking fees or by reducing the number of parking spaces. * **Working from home.** If you can, consider working from home instead of commuting to an office. This can help to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. * **Carpooling or taking public transportation when you need to drive.** If you do need to drive, try to carpool or take public transportation instead of driving alone. This will help to reduce the number of cars on the road.  Limiting car usage is a win-win for everyone. It can help to improve our environment, our economy, and our quality of life. So next time you're thinking about driving, consider walking, biking, taking public transportation, or working from home instead. It's good for the environment, your wallet, and your health.		1
Do you think students gets the benefits of being able to attend home school rather than distance learning?  Why to not bother nor having a question in your mind of sending you children to home school. i disagree on student's getting benefits from home school because :- they can get Anti-social, they won't be able to have Experiences and causing Damage.  First students will be Anti-social:- wont be able get to know how the society is wont be able to opened up about it not being able to have open minded risk taking not knowing how to talk in a large group of people feeling ashamed that the world not wanting them cause they are scared to try and fail feeling pushed away not knowing how to act in certain situations cause they dont know how to communicate well feeling awkward not understanding themselves instead of doing it for them selves they will leave for other not knowing themselves better than others being targeted of people using them they are more likely start to leave for people instead of themselves cause of the guilt and scared of not being wanted for being themselves instead of being themselves they choose to be a different person cause they don't want to get pushed away and of get pushed away they would rather keep themselves locked away and choose to live in someones shadow also they don't want people to distance themselves from them.  Second not having Experience:- not having experience by themselves rather than using the online resources they won't know much rather than their devices and knowledge but they won't get the feeling by being out there they won't be able to use any life lesson they used in high school for their collage year nor for the rest of their life the nature they will only live upon people expectations it might be hard for them to tell the who to the why for example they dont get a chance to be in activities, clubs, diversity, opportunities, field trip, labs, have extra time with our teachers physically special classes, etc.. not having a connection to the world feeling different emotions living with society and how to deal with it. i have a friends that goes to home school she loved it she said until she stop going home school she don't have to deal with high school drama, won't be board and more likely she won't be able to concern she will focus on thing's she have to do she won't be reckless she will do her job by her giving time but the downwards is being scared to make mistakes, being afraid, not being comparative enough, ashamed, restless her behavior start to change i ask why she told me since she stop going to home school it's a bit hard for her to communicate with people without getting offended getting her voice heard in the way she wanted it she couldn't use here experience enough to survive and she start to get depressed before it's to late we find a solution hat can help her like focusing on things she love to do to step out of her comfort zone to try new thing's to be risk taker, being open to what people have to say, knowing the difference between opinion and facts also more she is doing great know.  Third causing Damage:- sitting way to long in one position wont allow our blood to flow properly causing eye problem for staying for way to long even the brightness will have an effect on our eyes that will send strong message causing us a sharp pain in our headache i remember when there was a time that i get to be a home school student which i didnt like. my friends will come from school and i will be doing homework and assignments to catch up and it was a bit of struggle cause of the time difference that i have deal with i remember not having a time to go outside and play with them not help my parents and the got me upset sitting thee staying at my laptop heart my eyes and even my leg onetime i remember i got so sick of brightness not wanting to look at any brightness at all only darkness my head was about to blow since then i stopped going to home school not only because i was sick some of the circumstances wasnt good and it was a relief.  In Summary: Home School can be so stressful for students and parents special if the teacher is not effective enough parents and student should avoid it. Moreover, i am not saying that if you go to home school that you will end up horrible nor distance school student either also, that you are dumb there is not such a word like that it just how we manage our timing and not paying attention to things that matter the most not knowing the want and the need also u can succeed in home school but my position is with the lack of reasons it wont be effective as it is with distance high school. it's a good question to ask student what they prefer with in a survey too.         		0
TEACHER_NAME;  I heard you were going to change the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I disagree with that because, most students in our school have a grade C average. I know that if you probably made the average higher to a grade B average then it would bribe students to do their homework and pay attention more in school and then, they would work harder academically if they wanted to stay on their sports team (i. e. volleyball, basketball, Lacrosse, football, etc.).  Since most students only have a grade C average, there wouldn't be very many students trying out or participating in school sports because they would be unable too.  If you want us to win, and have a trophy case filled with 1st place ribbons and trophies then, you should let the school policy stay where it is; at a grade C average. Most students that do well academically, most of the time aren't good in sports because, they may not have time to practice their sports. Also, most students that are poor in academics, they are good in sports because they have the time to practice, get outside, be active and exercise more too. So for the students are good in sports but poor in academics you should keep it to a grade C average, because kids need a an outlet to go to, have fun and get their mind off of things. I hope this helped you think about your decision.  Sincerely,  Student		0
 The Face on Mars is a remarkable geological formation that has captured the imagination of people all over the world. This formation was named after the rocket scientist Gus Johnson, who first saw it and was reminded of the human face. The Face on Mars is a large, triangular structure that has been carved out of the Martian surface by the erosive forces of wind and water over millions of years.  The Face on Mars is located in the Martian canyon system of Valles Marineris, which is approximately 2,500 miles long and 125 miles wide. This canyon system is the largest in the solar system and was formed by the collapse of a great Martian volcano. The Face on Mars is located at the center of the canyon, at the point where the volcanic eruption caused the greatest amount of deformation in the Martian surface.  The Face on Mars has several features that make it distinct from the surrounding landscape. It has a series of smooth, horizontal surfaces that are interrupted by large, sharp cliffs. These cliffs give the triangular shape to the formation and are caused by the movement of the water and wind erosion over time. The entire formation is surrounded by a moat of water that has filled in the bottom of the canyon.  The Face on Mars has been the subject of much scientific study and debate. Some scientists believe that the formation is the remains of an ancient Martian ocean, while others believe it to be the result of volcanic activity. Still, others speculate that the formation may be of biological origin, created by the activity of microorganisms on the Martian surface.  Despite the various theories, the Face on Mars remains one of the most intriguing geological formations on the planet. It is a testament to the power of erosion and the forces of nature that can shape even the largest of structures. As Scientists continue to study the Face on Mars and explore the Martian surface, we can only wonder what other secrets lie hidden beneath the Martian surface.  In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a remarkable geological formation that has captured the imagination of people all over the world. It is a testament to the power of erosion and the forces of nature that can shape even the largest of structures. Whether it is the result of volcanic activity, ancient Martian ocean, or biological origin, the Face on Mars remains one of the		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing our president by popular vote. I believe that this change is necessary to make our democracy more fair and representative.  The Electoral College was established in the 18th century as a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by Congress and those who wanted the president to be elected by a popular vote of the people. At the time, the country was much smaller and more geographically spread out than it is today. It was difficult for people in different parts of the country to communicate with each other, and there was no national media to inform voters about the candidates. As a result, the Electoral College was seen as a way to ensure that all parts of the country would have a say in the election of the president.  However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary or fair. Today, we have instant communication and a national media that can inform voters about the candidates. We also have a much larger and more diverse population. In a country of over 300 million people, it is absurd to think that the votes of a few thousand people in a handful of swing states should determine the outcome of the presidential election.  The Electoral College also disadvantages groups of people who tend to vote for the same party. For example, people who live in urban areas are more likely to vote for Democrats, while people who live in rural areas are more likely to vote for Republicans. This means that the votes of people who live in urban areas are worth less than the votes of people who live in rural areas.  The Electoral College also leads to candidates focusing their campaigns on a handful of swing states. This means that candidates ignore the needs of voters in the other states, who are effectively disenfranchised.  For all of these reasons, I believe that it is time to abolish the Electoral College and elect our president by popular vote. This change would make our democracy more fair and representative, and it would ensure that the person who wins the popular vote also wins the presidency.  I urge you to support this important reform.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
Texting and driving is a serious issue, around 10 teenagers die daily from texting and driving. With over 500,000 drivers admitting to using a cellphone while driving, and at least 25% of those being teens our future generations are growing more irresponsible on the roads. Car crashes are the main cause of death for teens considering texting and driving is over five times more likely to cause an accident than drunk driving. With the increase in people who text and drive the risk of being on the road also increases.  Distracting driving is the cause of over half of all car accidents and is most commonly found in ages 16-19. Parents need to be teaching their children the importance of staying focused behind the wheel. Parents need to make sure that their kids are staying safe on the roads and safe around other drivers. There are multiple car trackers that parents can access to track their kids on the roads and some parents even prohibit taking a phone while driving  Future generations are continuing to text and drive regardless to the numerous laws restricting distracted driving. A lot of teens continue to text and drive even though most of them are familiar with their states driving laws. However, most teens are not aware that distracted driving is more dangerous than drinking and driving and fail to see that their phones reduce their reaction speed and hand eye coordination behind the wheel.  If the countless driving laws that restrict texting and driving don't stop you from checking your phone behind the wheel then think about the risk you are putting on yourself and all the drivers around you. For a lot of drivers who struggle staying off their phone, they can start off by simply turning off their phone and putting it in the console. Other features like Bluetooth and do not disturb mode also help drivers keep their eyes on the road.  So if you ´re thinking about responding to your friend while driving, just simply wait until you have time to respond. There is no point in risking you and everyone around you over a stupid text. Just turn the phone off and wait until you ´re done driving to ensure the safety of all drivers and decrease the risk of a fatal accident.   		0
I disagree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While extracurricular activities offer many benefits, they should remain optional for students rather than mandatory.   There are several reasons why extracurricular activities should not be required. First, some students thrive in academic environments and do not have sufficient time or energy for additional commitments outside of schoolwork. Requiring extracurricular activities would overburden these hard-working students and negatively impact their academic performance.   Second, extracurricular activities are not one-size-fits-all. Each student has different interests, talents, and schedules. Forcing participation would not allow students to choose activities that truly match their passions and skills. They may end up spending time in activities they do not enjoy simply to fulfill the requirement. This risks burnout and reduced motivation.   Third, extracurricular activities are not accessible to all students equally. Some activities require fees for equipment, travel, or lessons that lower-income families cannot afford. A mandatory policy could disadvantage these students. It could also prevent students with life commitments outside of school, such as jobs or family care, from graduating.   Instead of requiring extracurricular activities, schools should encourage participation and offer a diverse range of options to appeal to all kinds of students. If a student chooses not to participate, the decision should respect their other priorities and responsibilities. Overall, extracurricular activities are most beneficial when students have autonomy to select activities that they find genuinely engaging and meaningful. For these reasons, I do not believe participation should be mandatory for all students.		1
Dear principal:  I think the principal should make the students do community work so the can help out people who need help. Its also not a waist of time because you are doing something good for the community. It can also change the world if you help some one. Its also not a waist of time for them because your doing something important for someone ells. Also something you might want to do might not be that important. You might just be doing nothing instead you could help some one out or keep the world green and stop pollution. They can also raise money for children in need. for example if they need shoes so they will not be walking bear footed, also they can donate cloth they don't need anymore or want to the children who do really need them. They can also use the money they get to pay for children's doctor bills they could be saving some ones live. Over all i think it is a great thing to do for your self and for some one ells. Its also does not have to be something as big as that it can be something small and it will change the live or lives of some one ells. So i think the principal should require the students to do some community service. It also can teach them a lesson as well, it could teach them if one day they were in the person's place that they are helping they would want some help as well. The students are also going to feel really good inside because they did something for some one who needed it and they will know they changed the life of some one out there. I think you should let the students do community service.  From:  STUDENT_NAME		0
I belive thate the face is just a natural landform becouse of facts  One exaple of why i belive its just a natural landform is in the text it states on april 5th 1998 mars global surveyor flew over cydonia and snapped a photo ten times sharper than the original viking photos revealing a narural landform. Another reson is in the text it states on april 8 2001 a cloudless summer day in cydonia mars global surveyor frew close enough for a second look.  Another exaple of why i belive its just a natural landform is in the text it stats thate they had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view. In the text it also stats thate malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolut maximum resolution. In the text it also stats each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo. In the text it also statses that it is equivalent of a landform common around the american west.  I would understand why somone would belive it was not a natural landform. one reson they may not is in the text it stats it was winter in april 98 it was clooudy time of year on the red planit. In the text it also stats that some pepoul belived aliens marking where hidden by haze.  And so becouse of facts such as it being equivalint to a landform commen around the american west i belive it is not alins. so i hope this proves thate the face is just a natural landform.                                             		0
 Facial action coding systems (FACS) are a way of analyzing and tracking people's facial expressions and movements. In order to measure facial expressions, an FACS typically involves recording images of a person's face, then analyzing the images to identify specific facial movements and expressions. The system is based on the idea that there are a limited number of facial movements that humans are capable of making, and that each of these movements can be codified and classified based on certain criteria.   One of the most widely used FACS is the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which was developed by Paul Ekman in the 1970s. This system involves analyzing specific facial features and tracking their movements over time. The FACS can identify specific facial expressions, such as smiles, frowns, and raises of the eyebrows, and can also track more subtle movements like the wrinkles in the corners of the eyes or the widening of the pupils.   FACS can be used in a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and even advertising. For example, in psychology, FACS can be used to study how people respond to different stimuli and to measure changes in emotional state over time. In neuroscience, FACS can be used to study the neural mechanisms underlying facial expressions and movements. In advertising, FACS can be used to analyze how people respond to different ads and to identify what elements of an ad are most effective at generating a response.   Overall, FACS provides a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing human behavior and emotions. By identifying specific facial expressions and movements, FACS can provide valuable insights into how people are feeling and how they are responding to different stimuli. With continued research and development, FACS has the potential to become an even more powerful tool for understanding and improving human behavior.		1
 The Face on Mars is Merely a Natural Landform   There has been much debate and speculation around the strange formation seen in photos taken by the Viking orbiter in 1976 of Cydonia Mensa on Mars. Some believe it depicts an artificially constructed face, suggesting remnants of an ancient Martian civilization. However, upon further analysis and comparison to similar formations on Earth, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests the Face is simply a naturally occurring landform and was not created by aliens.  One of the key pieces of evidence it is natural is its partial appearance. Only part of the face is clearly defined, while other areas fade or blend into the surrounding terrain. If it were intentionally constructed, one would expect more defined, symmetrical features across the entire supposed "face." Additionally, similar formations can be found on Earth that look remarkably like faces from certain angles but are undoubtedly natural. For example, the Obama rock formation in Hawaii bears a passing resemblance to the former US President but was clearly carved over eons by wind and water erosion rather than sculpted intentionally.   The scale of the supposed Face also suggests it is natural in origin rather than artificially built. At around 1.5 miles wide, such a massive structure would have been an tremendously ambitious engineering feat, even for an advanced civilization, and its purpose remains unclear. It seems highly improbable such a large statue would be constructed without any other signs of an inhabited outpost or civilization. Higher resolution images from later Mars orbiters also failed to uncover any other constructed structures or artifacts near the Face that might corroborate the artificial hypothesis.  In summary, upon close inspection the evidence overwhelmingly indicates the Face on Mars is simply a chance product of natural geological processes such as wind erosion over long periods of time acting on the variegated rock layers of Cydonia Mensa. While its vague pattern may resemble a face to some observers, especially in the low resolution Viking images, more detailed analysis confirms it is truly a naturally formed Martian landform rather than vestige of an ancient civilization. For these reasons, the artificial theory has rightly been dismissed by the scientific community in favor of purely geological explanations.		1
Self-esteem is defined as having a positive opinion of oneself, and achievement as reaching a goal or standard. In the essay, the writer explains how elements of self-esteem, achievement, confidence, trust, learning and work are integral to success. For instance, to gain the trust of others, a person needs to demonstrate confidence and dependability in their work. Similarly, a sense of personal fulfillment and self-esteem is heightened when one achieves success in learning experiences. To illustrate this, the author provides an example of how engaging in meaningful work and activities can lead to academic and career success. Another example the author gives is how hard work and dedication can lead to professional achievements and a sense of inner worth. Through these examples, the essay expresses the importance of the concepts of self-esteem, achievement, confidence, trust, learning, and work in enabling success.		1
You should always seek out for new Idea's and opinions. Did you know that half of the top businesses in the world were not from the idea of the owner. It came from people with ideas and newly opened up opinions.  When someone gives you an idea for a business there basically trying to help you invest in money or help you gain money for the better if the buisnes and the owner himself. Let's say a construction worker is about to go and build a house or another type of building you need someones opinion or idea to make sure your doing it right so therefore people can by your builing. People even need ideas or opinions when it comes to eating at a resteraunt, your not going to eat nasty food are you?  When people ask for advice the are asking for your opinion or how feel to feel about the subject the person is talking about. When people bring up asubject about something you bring up more than one person because it was more then one persons Idea or opinion. Now that you cn see basically the whole world woudln't be what it is today if it weren't for idea's and opinions.  The are is never a bad Idea or opinion also every question that you ask is a good question. Things get built faster and even things get invented based off somobodys opinion. Whenever you feel as if you need to ask a question go ahead and ask the question because there is never a bad question to ask because you might be on the verge of creating something new and just don't know it yet.  Lots of eventers createed a lot things based on there opinion on something. Thomas Edison belived that he could make a ball of light and what did he do he mad the light bulb and every single house in the world that uses electricity uses the light bulb,I even got one at my house. Bengimin Franklin wanted to find out what lightning was so he went outside with a kite and a and a key and he captured and it couldv'e killed him. But it did not instead of dieing he was the creater of elctrictity. How do you think you got to work today? Even public speakers have there own opinions how do you think African American children and American children are in the same school,becasue Martin Luther King Jr belived or felt as if that the shouldn't be segregated any longer. The thing is about that is that is was his opion and helt to need he needed to say what he thought to everybody now lookat the world.  Now that you have seen all of the evidence, you know that opinions matter no matter hiw stupid you may think it is. You could be on the verge to something beyond great or even an inventer. Just know you opinion matters know matter what!		0
 Introduction:  Driverless cars are a technological advancement that has been in the works for many years. The idea of driving without the need for a driver is a popular one, but the question is, should driverless cars be developed? In the article   Driverless Cars are Coming,   the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. In this essay, I will argue against the development of driverless cars.  Body:  The author states that driverless cars will reduce the number of accidents on the road. This is a positive aspect of the technology, but it is also false. The author cites statistics from the NHTSA, which state that 94% of accidents on the road are caused by human error. However, even a computer system can make errors. The author also cites the case of a Google self-driving car that hit a bus, but this is an isolated incident, and it is unclear how often this happens. Additionally, human error is not the only cause of accidents on the road. Weather conditions, poor road maintenance, and mechanical failures can also contribute to accidents. Therefore, the claim that driverless cars will reduce the number of accidents on the road is not accurate.  Another positive aspect of driverless cars is that they will provide more accessibility to the elderly and disabled. This is understandable, as these individuals may not have the ability to drive themselves. However, there are other ways to provide accessibility without the development of driverless cars. Autonomous vehicles can still be controlled by a human driver, which would still provide accessibility to the elderly and disabled. Additionally, there are already existing public transportation options, such as buses and trains, that can provide accessibility to these individuals. Therefore, the claim that driverless cars will provide more accessibility to the elderly and disabled is not accurate.  Conclusion:  In conclusion, the development of driverless cars is not necessary. The claim that they will reduce the number of accidents on the road is false, and there are other ways to provide accessibility to the elderly and disabled. Furthermore, the author does not address the potential risks associated with the technology, such as job loss, addiction to technology, and the cost of development and maintenance. Therefore, the benefits of driverless cars do not outweigh the risks. The focus should be on improving the existing transportation system and finding more efficient and cost-effective ways to provide accessibility to all individuals.		1
In today's world driving a car is a daily thing. People drive cars everyday either to get to work or run arrnes and do many other things. Cars should be put to limited usage becuase cars are a leading factor in air pollution. Also limited car usage is helpful because it can help you stay healthy and in shape.  Cars should be put to limited usage because cars are a leading factor in air pollution.  Like it says in source 1 "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intense areas in the United States." Cars release gases into the air which cause pollution. The pollution is bad for the enviroment and for civilians health. Like this one time in Paris the pollution form cars got so bad it created a smog over the city. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced driving ban to clear the area of the global city. Citezens of Paris were fined if they were seen driving during the ban, only some cars were abke to be driving on specific days. Just after a few days of this ban the smog cleared enough for a vehicles were able allowed to drive.  To reduce this we must do what a few cities around the world do. Some small cities around the world are reducing car usage by creating more accesible public transportation methods, with less parking space. Also the stores are placed on a walk way, on a main street rather than in malls which are far away.  Also, cars should be put to limited usage because it can help you stay healthy and in shape. If you dont use cars you be forced to walk or to ride a bike. Doing this will be physical activity and help you stay in shape. You wont have to sit in a car and just press a pedal to move. That will get you lazy and fat. If you ride a bike instead or walk you are moving and naking your body work, keeping yourself from being fat and staying healthy.  In conclusion, car usage should be limited becuase cars are a leading factor in air pollution and also limited car usage is helpful because it can help you stay healthy and in shape.      		0
Hey there!   So, I know it's not exactly the coolest thing to do, but I think elementary schoolers should have to do community service. I mean, think about it, we're basically just sitting around all day, learning stuff and stuff. It's not like we're actually contributing to society or anything. But, if we did community service, we could be helping people and making a difference!   First of all, community service can teach us important life skills like responsibility and empathy. Like, if we're helping out at a soup kitchen, we're not just sitting there playing games on our phones. We're actually helping people who are hungry and don't have enough food. And, if we're cleaning up a park, we're not just messing around, we're actually making the place cleaner and nicer for everyone.   And, it's not like it has to take up a lot of time. Like, we could do it during recess or something. I mean, I know we have a lot of fun during recess, but think about how much more fun it would be if we were doing something good for the community instead of just playing tag.   Plus, it can be really rewarding. Like, I heard about this one kid who did a community service project where he made blankets for homeless people. And, he was so happy and proud of himself when he finished. It was like, wow, he made a real difference in someone's life.   So, yeah, I think elementary schoolers should totally have to do community service. It's not only good for us, but it's good for the community too. And, who knows, maybe one day we'll be the ones making the rules and we can make sure that community service is a requirement for everyone!   Anyway, that's my speech. I hope you guys agree with me. Thanks for listening!		1
In my opinion, students would benefit from working at home. Distant learning can help in many ways. The idea of distant learning could put less stress on students as a whole. And make a teachers job a little bit easier. It could possibly solve issues that students have in schools. Distant learning can also help the students that dont like school. Being successful would be a lot easier, do to the fact more learning exercises would be put to use.  Working at home would be a good idea for the the people that dislike school. If a student is more comfortable at home, they would perform better on the work their doing. Some students get distracted easily and can't focus around a large amount of people. Being at home would eliminate some of the distractions that occur while at school. To do school work at home is a big responsibility. Although, high school student are mature enough to handle the responsibility of working at home. The students that think they would do a better job at home should be granted the opportunity to do so. If students feels they would do better learning a different way i dont see why they should be stopped.  It'll be less stressful for teachers as well. They would have smaller classes to teach. Which means they can be more available to the students in their classrooms. Teachers would be able to accomplish more if their class has a full understanding on whats being taught to them. Therefore they can teach a consistent pace that everybody comfortable with. There will also be more room to help the students that learn at a slower pace than others. Students could be more confident knowing they have help when needed when they feel like their struggling.  The students that get bullied and picked on may not want to go to school. If they feel as if school is not safe for them, that can mentally mess them up. Bullying is a big issue for schools in the United States. If the students that are getting bullied dont have to go to school, they would feel more safe. If those same students worked at home, they would feel safe and still receive an education. I would rather for my kids to do school work at home if they was constantly being bullied.  In conclusion, distant learning has it's ways of helping students. It would solve majority of the issues at school. It can boost the confidence in the people that dont like school. Options are expanded by introducing more ways to get you education. Having that in place could make more teenagers successful. 		0
Dear, Principal  To , the principal  I would like to inform [you/tell], you how bad of and idea it is to let cell phones be brought to school to use during lunch . I' am a fellow student here. One reason would be that students will be using them during lunch and would most likely start a conversation , that would most likely go unfinished because of lunch. More than likely any student who does not finish they conversation and knows they have been given privileges will go, and finish there conversation during class.  Also another reason i believe why the idea of allowing cell phones to be used during school is a very bad idea and would make or city, town, district, and state look less academic. I believe we would be us to compare to better districts, and states of the U.S. . Please take into consideration of this, because we do not go to school to fool around. We attend school for academic and career purposes only.  In, conclusion are school is better off the way it is .  Your, fellow student.		0
Dear Principal,  I do not think that requiring community service for students is a good idea. First, this will take time away from homework, studying, and extracurricular activities. Second, some students are in more sports, clubs, and activities outside of school than others, and wouldn't have much time for extra community service on top of that. Lastly, clubs are made that require community service in some schools, instead of making everybody required. If you required community service at our school, it wouldn't be a smart idea.  First, requiring community service for students will take time away from their homework, studies, and activities outside of school. Any student who is struggling to stay on top of the work load would start receiving failing grades because they get less time to study for tests and finish homework. Students with other activities going on would be rushed and stressed, as opposed to if they chose to join a club or group of students who wanted to do the community service.  Second, some students have more work, activities, and sports after school than others. For example, if some students have multiple sports, harder classes, and jobs before and after school, then it isn't fair to require them to complete as much community service as other students who get off with easy classes, and no sports or clubs. This new rule would be unfair to certain students. Maybe a club that requires anyone who isn't already in a club or sport to join and do community service would be a better idea.  Finally, requiring community service for all students is a bad idea. This would take time away from homework, studying, and any clubs or sports the students participate in. It would be unfair to the students that are involved in many other activities, as well as the students who aren't in these activities. A club that students could join voluntarily would be a much smarter choice. Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  A Student		0
Students shouldn't have to be forced into participating in an extracurricular activity. Why, you might ask? Students shouldn't have to be forced to do something and they should and will have the personal freedom to choose whether or not they should do one. They are responsible and mature enough to make their own decisions on the subject.  Not just students, but everyone should have the personal freedom to what they want when they please, as long as it doesn't break any laws. While it would be good to have every student participate in an after-school activity, they shouldn't be forced to do one. It's better to have the all students participating in an after-school activity statistic come naturally, not have it be forced on them through an unfair and authoritarian rule.  The students are responsible and mature enough to make their own decisions on this topic.  Whether or not they want to do an extra-curricular activity should dictate whether or not they do an extra-curricular activity. If the child is not all that old ,and thus, less mature, they can still make the decision themselves because they, and only they know if they want to do an extra-curricular activity.  In conclusion, students should and will have the personal freedom to make a decision on whether or not they should do an extracurricular activity and they shouldn't have to be forced to make that decision without their explicit consent. Secondly, the students are responsible enough to make their own decisions and should be allowed to do so. Whether or not they want to do an extra-curricular activity should be left up to them, and only them, not their parents, and most definitely not the school and the state.                       		0
In today's society, it has become increasingly common for people to pretend to be someone they are not in order to gain attention. This can take many forms, ranging from dressing in a certain way to adopting a certain accent or mannerism. While some people may see this behavior as harmless, others may view it as a negative thing that can have long-term consequences.  One of the main reasons why people may feel the need to pretend to be someone they are not is because of low self-esteem. When people feel insecure about themselves, they may try to find ways to make themselves feel more confident or attractive by adopting certain traits or behaviors that they believe will help them fit in with a certain group. This can be especially prevalent in social media, where people often feel the need to present a perfect image in order to gain followers or likes.  However, while pretending to be someone else may provide a temporary boost in self-esteem, it can also lead to a host of negative consequences. For example, if people consistently pretend to be someone they are not, they may begin to lose touch with their true selves and their own values. This can lead to feelings of confusion and disorientation, as well as a lack of authenticity in their relationships with others.  Additionally, the act of pretending to be someone else can also perpetuate double standards. If people only feel comfortable around people who fit into certain categories or conform to certain expectations, they may be unwilling to accept people who do not fit those categories or do not conform to those expectations. This can create a narrow-minded and exclusionary society that does not value diversity or individuality.  Finally, pretending to be someone else can also make it difficult to maintain a small circle of close friends. When people are constantly trying to fit in with a certain group or present a certain image, they may not be able to truly connect with others on a deep level. This can make it difficult to form meaningful relationships and can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation.  In conclusion, while pretending to be someone else may provide a temporary boost in self-esteem, it can also have long-term negative consequences. It can lead to a loss of authenticity, perpetuate double standards, and make it difficult to maintain a small circle of close friends. As such, it is important for people to		1
The Electoral College has been here for many years. Over the aast years many aeoale think it is unfair to the voters. There are many conflicts that have risen about it. Without a doubt , the Electoral College is unfair and irrational to voters because they voters are basically voting for no reason. The aresident they want to vote for doesnt count and instead the votes of the Electoral College do , the electors shouldnt be the only aeoale to vote just because they are qualified doesnt mean only their oainion and choice should be heard. Also , a direct election would be much better and everyones votes count and its equal.  To begin with , when the first Electoral College was made no one really argued about it. But over the many years conflicts have come. Peoale have realized that was is being done istn fair or right. " At the most basic level , the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because the winnertakeall system in each state , candidates dont saend time in states they know the have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" state". source 2, a. 13. Everyone has the right to vote but if their votes dont count whats the aoint?. Peoale should have the right to voice their own oainion and be aart of the voting. The electors that are chosen have only a little amount of oainions. If the voters would be included there would be a variety of choices of who should win. Every american should be comfortable and certain about who they voted for and if the Electoral College votes contradicts that there can be aroblems.  Furthermore , In a direct election everyone is treated equally. Unlike , the voting we have now , "If you lived in Texas , for instance , and wanted to vote for John Kerry , you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors aledged to Kerry". source 2, a. 10. Voters cant always control whom their electors vote for but voters sometimes can get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. Why have so much going on when you can aeacefully just count the votes of the voters and electors together?. Yes , they may be the electors and might have more knowledge of whats going on but they are just aeoale too and everyone is created equally so definitely their votes shouldnt be the only ones actually counted.  Moreover , Bigger states may have a bigger effect on the votes because of their large amount of aeoale voting. By , not making their vote count some aeoale can feel that their voices are not being heard which can lead to in some cases riots and rebellions etc. Voting haaaens for a reason if gives the world a chance to aick whom they want to see lead them and who they feel like is the right aerson but in the end if there votes cant count and actually go to the electors limits their aower and freedom to saeak. " Voters in aresidential elections ae aeoale who want to exaress a aolitical arefeence rather than aeoale ho think that a single vote may decide an election".source 3 , a.23. The Electoral College may have worked in the aast but now its not working as well.  To conclude , The Electoral College arocess should be stoaaed for numerous number of reasons. It limits aeoales oainions and aeoale are voting for no reason if they cant aick who they want. Whoever is running for aresident and everyone who votes for one aerson shouldnt just be heard from a certai groua of aeoale. Everyones oainion should matter.		0
Dear state senator, Election day is held every four years on the frist Tuesday in the month of November. When you elect for president would you prefer voting yourself and having your vote count or voting for someone who will then vote for your state and elect for the president of choice. For example, lets use the election of Obama versus MittRomeny. imagine if you voted for a man who said "If you vote for me to represent your state I will elect Obama!" He might be tricking you and vote for MittRomeny when it is time for them to vote. That means your vote for them and that promise he made to your state dosn't matter because he wanted to voted for MittRomney and he knew majority of the state would go for Obama.  I believe that the Electoral College is wrong for the simple fact is that you do not know the intentions of the reperesentors. For example, in article "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong" it states in section "What's wrong with the electoral college" that "Back in 1960, segregation in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy. In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.... Oh, and what state sends two electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent's electors, but he made sure to do so without establishing a precedent'" This statement shows that whoever is running can overthrow the other by chaning the mind of their electors.  Also it state in the the same article and same section that "ATt the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." That means the states who did not get to see campaign ads blindly vote for an elector who will then blindly vote for a president.  I believe that popular voting will be a lot better because so that everyone can vote and not just one person picking for an entier state. Also in popular voting campaign ads will be seen in every state and everybody can make their own choices so noone is blindly voting. At the end after each state is done voting, all the votes will be added together, and a president will be chosen by majority rules.		0
It is becoming increasingly evident that one part of life many older people took for granted may be going away soon. The invention of the car was revolutionary, but in modern times it seems that many wish to build communities that do not revolve around them. The reason for doing this vary somewhat across the different movements, but one main reason is that recuding car usage will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases and pollution. In fact, many places where this movement has gained traction are cities where pollution was a major issue, such as Paris and Bogota. Another factor is that many people simply are not as interested in cars as they were a few years ago, and have licenses only as a backup. The various movements are spreading all over the world, slowly but surely.  "In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams," said Andrew Selsky of the Seattle times. Bogota, Colombia is notable for being one of the earlier players in this movement, and has shown that it can be effective. Not even rain convinced people that cars would be a better option. "These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders," said Enrique rivera. Not only have other Colombian cities joined in the movement, but is has inspired similar actions in other countries. It would only be a matter of time before some people would take it to the next level.  "Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars," said Elisabeth Rosenthal of the New York Times. While not outright banned, cars are looked down upon in this square mile rectangle, where it is much easier to simply walk or bike. The only places to park are a 40,000 parking garage and inside one's house. "...Some new suburbs may well look more Vaubanlike, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world..." said Rosenthal. This approach is gainging ground, as not only does the model inherently reduce carbon emissions, but also is a sharp contrast to 1950sstyle suburbs that previously dominated the land. Another probable reason, however, might be due to shifting interests. You might soon be seeing less cars in general.  "...America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling," said Rosenthal. America may be the home of the classic muscle car, but many people today would rather have something less flashy and more utilitarian. 2005 was the year where the most people were driving in recent times, and ever since then it has been dropping. "I think that it means something fundamental it going on," said Prof. Michael Sivak of the University of Michigan. Many people are simply losing interest in driving cars, while some people simply cannot afford them due to socioeconomic factors. Also, the advent of the Internet and social netowrking has made many people "feel more conncected" without the need to drive around in oder to meet someone in real life. If this trend continues, which it is predicted to do, then situations like what recently occured in Paris would be more readily accepted.  "After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban to clear the air of the global city," said Robert Differ of the Chicago Tribune. It seems almost surreal for a major city to outright ban driving, but that is exactly what Paris did. Cars are occasionally banned based on their license plate, so as to still let some traffic flow while reducing smog, which had become a major problem for the city. "...The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world," said Differ. Of all the European capitals, Paris is by far the most polluted, mostly due to a combination of warm weather and the abundance of diesel fuel. The simple act of banning driving has been a major help in reducing smog, with the skies clearing up enough for it to be considered safe for oddnumbered cars to return to the streets. It still might take some time for other cities to go to measures as extreme as Paris did, but it very well might happen eventually.  The world has seen many communities test the idea of modern carless commuting for us, and we should be taking notes. While copying Paris seems like a risky way to start, communities like Vauban are excellent baby steps, and major cities like Bogota participating in these activities only once a year can get people used to the idea elsewhere. Decreasing carbon emissions is an important goal for urban areas, and for a while it seemed like cars were a neccesary evil. Now, however, it has been shown that life can go on without them. Perhaps further experiments will occur in the future that will introduce the idea to more people, letting others consider various options. Now is the perfect time to prepare for the future.		0
 Dear State Senator,  Here are my thoughts on the US presidential electoral process. I think that the Electoral College is a failed system. The College is supposed to balance out the votes of all states, but lately, it has let the few swing states decide the election, making it practically impossible for anyone to win without campaigning in a few key places. This is not fair to the voters or the candidates. If we are going to have a democracy, then we should have a popular vote.  I understand that some people are afraid of a popular vote. They say that it would be a disaster because the populous states would always win. But we have had that situation before when the Electoral College did not exist and it forced candidates to campaign nationwide. Also, we have seen only four out of fifty states decide the election in the last twenty years. That is not a strong argument for keeping the system as it is.  There are other arguments for keeping the Electoral College. The system is part of our constitutional tradition, but that is not good enough reason to keep any part of the government. Slavery was part of our constitutional tradition too. The system incentivizes candidates to visit all areas of the country, but they could do that under a popular vote as well. It is harder for third parties to win, but that is not necessarily a good thing. A third party could have real support, but the Electoral College makes it nearly impossible for them to win.   In conclusion, the Electoral College is a bad system. It is undemocratic, and it does not treat all voters equally. There is no good reason to keep the Electoral College. If we are going to have a democratic government, then we need a popular vote.  The potential consequences of changing to a popular vote are not as bad as some people think. We need to change for the good of the country.  I hope you will consider my thoughts on this matter. I would be happy to discuss this with you further.   Sincerely,  agnosed with stupid, somehow unable to cure myself		1
The author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to idenify human emotions. I think the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a clasroom is valuable for these reasons.  In the article it says that," Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness." Then he will associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscle. Another reason that I think is valuable is when in the article it says that." In fact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by look on her."  This is why I think the use of this technology is valuable. So that we can test which of the six emotions we are in. The second reason is that we human are already perform the same impressive calcauation every day.            		0
With the years, we have changing many things in our society. Since technology, by making new electronic devices, to things in our government, by making new laws and new things to help people in all the country. But, does that mean that we have to change the Electoral College to election by popular vote for the presindet of the United States? In my point of view, the Electoral College is a traditional way to vote the President by the Congress and by qualified citizens that our founding fathers established in our Constitution. And there are many evidence to support that keeping the Electoral College is beneficial to our country.  According to the text "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President" by Richard A. Posner, A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, and it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, in 2012, Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of Romney. Almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landsalide electoral vote vistory in that satate. This demostrates, how people accept the fact that they are voting the electors and then for the President and Vice president. This help people by making easily the hour of vote for a candidate.  However, as we can se in the texts above, not everybody things like this. For example, in the text "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" by Bradford Plumer, the author says that according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. But, each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. (Posner, paragraph #16).  Another evidence from the text "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised mothod of choosing the President" by Richard A. Posner,  is when he says "The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal" (Posner, paragraph #19). That means that No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite has no incentive to campaign heavely in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing huis plurality in states that he knows he will win. "The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised..." That highlights how the Electoral College is trying to helping people vote their candidates and feel safe and comfortables with them.  To conclude, despite the fact many people say that the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism and a non-democratic method of selecting  a president, the Electoral College is a traditional way to vote the President by the Congress and by qualified citizens that our founding fathers established in our Constitution that helps our community to help people with thir desicions and make our life more comfortable and easy.    		0
  Dear State Senator, I'm writing to urge you to keep or modify the Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. The arguments in favor of the Electoral College are persuasive, and I will examine each of them below, along with some counterarguments and evidence from numerous sources. First and foremost, the Electoral College provides a system that ensures the election's well-defined outcome. As Judge Richard A. Posner pointed out in "In Defense of the Electoral College," the electoral system guarantees that the winner will receive a significant margin of victory in most states, giving them a clear victory (Posner, 2013). This clarity is crucial since it lessens the likelihood of a tie in the electoral vote and the possibility of a candidate winning the presidency based solely on their ability to exploit a few swing states. Second, the Electoral College ensures that candidates must appeal to a broader range of people than just their party's base. Because each state is treated equally in the electoral system, candidates must concentrate their efforts on a broader range of states in order to win the presidency, rather than only concentrating on safe red or blue states (Posner, 2013). This encourages candidates to consider the requirements and problems of a broad range of individuals and regions, which can lead to more inclusive and varied coverage policies. Third, the Electoral College maintains the notion of "one person, one vote" by giving smaller states a voice in the presidential election process (Plumer, 2004). The popular vote system would essentially give the most populous states' residents more influence than others, which would be unfair to smaller states and their residents. The electoral system ensures that smaller states have a voice in dec		1
Google has had cars that could drive independently since 2009 under certain conditions . Driverless cars would have a huge impact in our world today with both a positive and negative affect. Google cofounder Serger Brin belives that the future of driveless cars a form a future of public taxi system. This would have a postiive affect because the cars would half of the fuel of todays taxi and would more flexible than a bus. Driverless cars are coming soon and has been used before, these will soon be able to help us and change the world, they will soon change the way we look at cars today.  Google cars have been known to drive more than half a million miles without a crash . This showes that they are safe but arent completly driveless. The use of driverless cars beneifits use because they arent driverless in certain conditions. These are arent driverless and require the use of the driver conditions like pulling in and out of driveways, getting through complicted traffic issue, and getting through road work. This will have a negative affect because they should be able to work under all condition of driving. Driverless cars can have negative aspect and positve aspect on the driving laws . In a negative way these cars cant function in certain areas and this can disrupt driving , it is also illgeal to even test computer driven cars in most states, and in a postive way these are allowed to be tested in most states and upgraded to the point of the driver can receive alters to notify them on things.  In 2016 Telsa has projected the use of a computer driven car, with 90 percent of autopilet driving system an used most of the time. otyher cars like Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan have pakned to relase the version of a computer driven car in 2020. These cars a ere soon to realese and they will help with many driving difficulties that we encounter today. This will have a positive outcome in our world.		0
The role a car plays in the life of an individual has made changes through out the years. There never was a significant meaning to having a car it just meant having a vehicle that can get you from point A to point B. As the human society continues to progress with the creations of technology, the use of cars has diminished greatly in different parts of the world. Not being able to use a car seems like there is no bright side, but there are actually many advantages on limiting car usage.  The United States always had this recognition of being one of the world's prime car cultures. "The first Model T cars were born in the U.S. It has also been the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized mustang Sally." President Barack Obama identifies in the article, The End of Car Culture, his dreams for the U.S "to curb the United State's geen house gas emissions will get a forturious assist from an incipent shift in American behavior." Going back to the article as reference, studies show "americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by... as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak... there was also a drop in percent of 16 to 39 year olds getting a license." The cause of the downfall in car usage can be pointed towards a few factors internet making telecommuting possible, the renewal of center cities, and the rise of cellphones and carpooling apps. It is not because society assumes cars are becoming of no use, the role of technological improvements are making things a lot easier than how things were in the 1960's. The United states has the option of using cars or not, in other places like Paris, the option to drive has become a choice made out of a person's own power.  Paris, France is a location that anyone dreams of visiting. The city is beautiful but the levels of smog have made it impossible for people to enjoy the views of the city. According to the article, Paris bans driving due to smog , "it has been enforced to the citizens of a partial driving ban in order to clear the air... people were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine which is 31 in the United States." The way things are organized in Paris goes by a person's license plate number. In correlation to the article, "congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifiying smog." However, not all of the cars used in Paris, France were banned. Those cars that are plugins, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers were allowed to roam the street of Paris. A good majority, 67 percent, of vehicles in France are made up of diesel, and that kind of fuel were the ones to blame since gasoline was not in favor in a city like that one. In the same way, places like Bogota, Colombia, had similar situations as the peolpe that live in France.  In the country of Colombia there has been a day dediated to doing things with no car it's a carfree day. In contrast to how banning driving is in Paris, Bogota, Colombia has everyone participate in this 24 hour event. If a person were to violate the rule they are to face 25 fines. The article, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, explains that "millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during the carfree day." Just like the goals in Paris, Colombia has goals to promote alternatice transportation and reduce smog. A businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza, explains "it's good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." No one would everythink that driving is as stressful as going to work. When put into mind, things begin to make sense. The early mornings of road rage people encounter makes their entire day a little more stressful than what it should be. Driving is a wonderful advantage but there is always more than just a car. Colombia's main goal, as expressed in the article "is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog." In the end of it all cars have always been in the making trying to find new ways to improve and modernize. Although cars may have had significant meanings in the older times, as society continues to prosper in technological making, cars are beginning to be identified as material objects that are not as important. They are just in use for people to get from one place to the next when other things are not working.		0
 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a standardized method developed to identify facial expressions and actions. It is a widely used system in various fields such as psychology, neuroscience, marketing, and robotics. FACS provides a codified language that can be used to describe and analyze the expressions that people make. The system was developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in 1969 and it has since become an essential tool in the scientific analysis of human emotion and behavior.  The FACS system has six basic expression categories: happiness, surprise, anger, fear, disgust, and contempt. Each category is represented by a specific facial expression that involves specific muscle movements. For example, the expression for happiness involves smiling and crinkling the eyes, while the expression for surprise involves raising the eyebrows and opening the mouth. The FACS system also provides a more detailed description of these expressions, including facial muscle movements that underlie each expression.  FACS has several important applications in various fields. In psychology, FACS is used to study the relationship between facial expressions and emotions. By analyzing the facial expressions of individuals, psychologists can better understand how people experience and express emotions. FACS is also used to develop interventions for people with emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety. For example, FACS can be used to train individuals to recognize and regulate their facial expressions in order to improve their emotional well-being.  In neuroscience, FACS is used to study the neural mechanisms underlying facial expressions. By recording the electrical activity of the facial muscles, researchers can better understand how the brain controls facial expressions. FACS can also be used to study the neural mechanisms underlying the relationship between facial expressions and emotions.  In marketing, FACS is used to test the effectiveness of advertisements and product designs. By analyzing the facial expressions of people who view an advertisement or interact with a product, marketers can gain insights into how people respond to their message. FACS can also be used to design products and advertisements that are more likely to evoke positive emotional responses, such as happiness and excitement.  In robotics, FACS is used to develop robots that can recognize and respond to human expressions. By analyzing the facial expressions of humans, robots can be programmed to respond in a more human-like manner. FACS can also be used to create more realistic telepresence systems, where people can interact with others as if they were in the same room.  In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is a standardized method that provides a codified language for describing and analyzing human facial expressions. It has important applications in various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, marketing, and robotics. By understanding the relationship between facial expressions and emotions, we can gain a better understanding of human behavior and design interventions for emotional disorders. Additionally, by using FACS to develop more realistic robots and telepresence systems, we can enhance human-like interactions in virtual environments.		1
I am with the people who are for using tecnology to read students emotional expressions. I am sure that this tecnolgy will help out everyone in different ways.  If teachers are not able to tell what is going on with a studant it make a teacher just get mad but the proplem with that is that thaey dont't know what that kid is going thought. In many different ways people are not all the same and some times school empolyees don't understand that. This technology works in many=y diffrent ways but it starts off when the computer constructs a 3-D computer modle of the face. The movement in one or more muscle is called an "action unit"  In paragrah 6 the auother gives example's for what this technology could be in a classroom In the this paragrah it siad " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" and this examople really shows how teachers can really benifit from have technology to help and tell what a student is felling and when they do teachers can try to help out and not just be mad at student for being confused. A student can really benifit from this as well,If a student feels confused there not going to want to make it seem that why. They will just keep flowing along and make it seem that they understand everything and when it comes to test time they will just fail and it's easy to understand that they don't want to seem like fools in frot of the class,but if we had the technology that we really asked for teachers will just know that a student will need help and stop the class to help the students a littel more.  Overall we need technology to help some student that have proplems learing in a school inverment and be able to puch them to new limits. Just thick about this technology will change the way we learn in school's ang just make everything much more easy thanks to a man called Thomas Huang who mad this type of technology.		0
Ummm... Okay!  Here's my essay:  So, like, when you're dealing with a really tough situation, it's way better to talk to multiple people instead of just one. I mean, think about it. When you're going through something hard, it can be really helpful to have someone to talk to who can offer advice and support. And if you're only talking to one person, you're kinda limiting yourself to just that one person's perspective.  Like, my best friend Emily and I were going through this really tough time in our lives, and we were both feeling super down about it. So we decided to talk to each other about it, and it was way better than talking to just one person. We were able to bounce ideas off each other and come up with ways to deal with the situation together. It was like, way more helpful than if we had just talked to one person.  And it's not just about getting advice or support. When you talk to multiple people, you're also getting different perspectives on the situation. Like, my brother is really into science and stuff, so when I was having trouble with a science project, I went to him for help. And he had this really cool idea that I never would have thought of if I had just talked to one person. So it's like, way better to talk to multiple people because you get more ideas and insights.  Okay, so yeah. Talking to multiple people is way better than just talking to one when you're dealing with a difficult situation. It's like, way more helpful and way more fun. You get more ideas and support, and it's not just one person's perspective. So, yeah.  That's my essay.		1
Dear Mr. Principal,  It's very important to do community service because the students need to learn how clean up the city. If i was them i would do community service because it fun because you are helping out your environment. There some students that agree with me that they say they help by tutoring elementary school children and they clean up litter. But there some students that disagree with us because community service takes too much time away from what they need. And that people love to throw there trash on the floor that not very nice to the community because you are making the city more worst.  We the student of the school would love to have to have community service everyday to help out the community. but you know how are city is very disgusting that why we need the student have to have community service but you have to ask the students parents if they can do community service everyday until the city is so clean.  i would like my city very clean with the help of my classmates. i know that my classmates		0
Have you ever wanted to just kick back and relax while your car does all of the driving? Have you ever thought about how dangerous that could be? I believe that semi or fully autonomous cars are a danger to the world. The cars are not not truly autonomous, nobody can really tell where responsibility lies when the computer is in control, and the technology that powers the cars may fail.  No car on the road today is completely computer controlled. The cars we have today run off of a computer, until it hits conditions it can not handle, requireing the driver to take over. In 2013, BMW made a vehicle that could run the car on its own, but the driver still had to hold on to the wheel. Many other cars have become semi autonomous, but require the driver to take over when there are different conditions, such as roadwork or there is an accident. Some of these semi auatonomous cars alert the driver when they need to take over, either by an indicator, physical vibration, or simply by announcing that the driver needs to take over. What if the driver falls asleep and the car fails to wake the driver to take control of the car? How safe is the car then?  Another problem with the reliablitly of these cars is the technology inside of them. The Google car for example, has sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a camera on the rearvier mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. The car runs off of all of these sensors, and needs every single one of them to run properly. But what happens if one of these sensors reade untrue values because they have malfunctioned or got covered up by something. Technology can only go so far into our lives before we are putting human life at risk. All it takes is one failure, one moment where a sensor isn't working correctly , and a persons life could be over. The sensors also cost money. This would make many of these cars almost unbuyable to the general public because of the cost of parts and matenience.  With all of that said, who is responsible if the car is in an accident or it kills somebody? Does the manufactorer who made the car get blamed, or does the driver who purchased it take responsibility? I personally belive that these cars are an assumed risk and that if the car is in an accident, that both the driver and the manufacterer are to blame. I believe that the driver could have attempted to do something to change the cars path, but it is more so the manuacturers fault becasue their car failed to stay in its own lane and out of the way of other traffic. The blame also depends on who was inc ontrol at the time of the accident, if the driver had control of the car, it is his or her fault. But if the computer was running the car, then it is the manufacturers fault.  These cars are not truly on autopilot, the technology is not completely reliable, and who is to blame for an accident? These points are all good reasons as to why these cars are a hazard to human life and should not be on our roads. So before you get right behind the idea of an autonomous car, think "do i trust my life and others lives to a machine?"      		0
Graduating early can be a great opportunity to jumpstart one's dream job or start college earlier. Completing a four-year program in a shorter period of time is a testament to a student's dedication, ambition, and discipline. Financially, graduating early can mean saving money on tuition and room and board fees, as well as less money spent on textbooks and other supplies.   At the same time, graduating early can be more difficult in terms of academic rigor and personal challenge. Not only does it require taking extra classes, but it also requires more intense studying time and a more disciplined approach to course selection. It can also lead to a feeling of academic burnout earlier than normal.   When weighing the pros and cons of graduating early, it is important for each individual to take into account their own academic and financial situation, as well as their own feelings of academic burnout. Ultimately, each student should decide whether graduating early is the appropriate decision for them. Graduating early does not necessarily guarantee a better education than the standard four-year plan; rather, each student should choose the path that best meets their individual needs and goals.		1
Should people be texting and driving?  Even though people this they can do it without an accident, people should not be using a phone while driving. Teens, being the main group of people driving distracted, including the fact that the majority of they are newly trained drivers could cause more damage than just a crash. In 2017, over 3000 people were killed due to drivers being distracted. Some things aren't worth the risk and can just be pushed off to another time. While driving and using the device you are putting other drivers, passengers, bystanders and even yourself at risk of getting hurt or much worse.  In any case, while you are texting and driving, you are not thinking about anyone else other than yourself. The main thing going through a person's head while on their phone is what's happening on the screen. You readers may have, or know someone who could be looking at their phone and not hear a word someone says. It's already disrespectful to be on your phone while talking to somebody, so imagine how crazy it is to be on it while operating dangerous vehicle at high speeds. Texting and driving is more of an impulse, the driver is more worried about getting caught than hurt ,but the punishment of death and homicide is worse than texting and driving.  Without a doubt, you may think that the person you are texting or the game that you are playing can be done at another time. The game can wait till you are out of the car, but if you need to communicate with someone, there are many alternatives than doing it while driving. You have option to call someone and put your phone on spreaker so it will be out of your way, pulling over into a parking lot is also a choice and finally texting at a red light or stop sign only if its legal in your state. Like the famous quote from Star Trek, The  Wrath of Khan, "the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few" meaning that you have to put the majority over yourself even if you think you shouldn't.  Although, you may not want to die, there are still more simple reasons you should avoid using your phone while driving. If you get caught you will have to pay an expensive fine and your car insurance will go up. Paying hundreds of dollars is not worth one text, one youtube video of anything else you could be doing on it. Most of the people who text and drive probably is doing it because they will be busy later, but going to court for a ticket will just add more to your schedule.  As a result, you as a reader can see all the risks and should yourself  "is this really worth it"? In a situation like this, the cons outweigh the pros and that's not good. If you want others to care about you then you have to respect yourself first to show them what it looks like. Think about the family of the kid you ran over all to heart some instagram post, it's not worth it. If you truly want to be a responsible driver, then obey the laws and don't use your phone while driving.  Works Cited  Armstrong, Ari.

I think we not should keep Electoral College. I thinks it not fair. Al Gore won the electoral votes and won the popular vote and still lost the presidency. Also, you are not evening voting for the persident you are voting for slate of electors to pick the president. It is not like you can, can control who the slate electors pick. It is also hard to understand and it can get confusing as well.  There is two different groups thay pick the president and vice-presidents. The people who pick the vice-president is The Senate. Each indivaule state only casts one vote. For example "The single representative from Wyoming, represent 500,000 voters, would have as much sayar the 55 representatives from California, who represents 35 million voters."- Bradford Plumer "The Indefensible Electoral College: Wht even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong." In Elcetoral College thy have a system were winner-take-all system in each state. "... Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning..." -Bradfors Plumer.  "But each party slecets a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee(and that trust is rarely betrayed)..."- Richard A. Posnoer "In Defense of the Electoral Coolege: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a President" When you read this and in pretheace it say the "and that trust is rarly betrayed" what do you think? Is it okay to say you will do something and then say "hey I am going to change my mind after people vote becaise they like what I said?" No it is nopt okay. If you say you are going to to do something and your state is counting on you, you need to keep you word and do what you said. Also, why is it the big states get more attention than the small states? Should an it be all the same?  It is also easier for the goverment. But I still think it need to be fair.  I think it should be equal. "Each candidates running for President in your state has hi ot her own group of elecotors."- The Office of the Ferderal Register " What is the Electoral College?"  I think we should get rid of Electoral College. There is a lot of trust problem and it is very confusing and hard to understand. It needs to be simple and easy and honset. It needs to be were you vote for the President and the Vice-President. NOt were you vote for for some one to do the voting. I also, think the number of Electoral votes need to be the same and not all be differnet.                      		0
Sure, here's my essay on whether the length of summer vacation for high school students should be changed:  Summer vacation is one of the most anticipated times of the year for high school students. It's a time to relax, recharge, and have fun with friends and family. However, the current length of summer vacation, which is typically around 3 months, has been a topic of debate among educators and students alike. Some argue that the length of summer vacation should be shorter, while others believe it should remain the same. In my opinion, the length of summer vacation should be changed, and here's why.  Firstly, a shorter summer vacation would allow students to have more time to focus on their studies during the school year. With a shorter summer break, students would have more time to review and reinforce the material they learned during the previous school year, which would help them perform better in their classes. Additionally, they would have more time to prepare for standardized tests and college entrance exams, which are crucial for their future academic and professional success.  Secondly, a shorter summer vacation would provide students with more opportunities to engage in extracurricular activities and internships. Many students use their summer vacation to participate in sports, music, or art programs, which help them develop their interests and skills. However, with a longer summer break, these opportunities may be limited, as many programs have shorter sessions or require students to commit to a longer period of time. By reducing the length of summer vacation, students would have more chances to participate in these activities, which could help them develop their passions and explore their career options.  Lastly, a shorter summer vacation could help reduce the summer learning loss that many students experience. Research has shown that students tend to forget some of the material they learned during the school year over the summer months, which can negatively impact their academic performance in the following school year. By reducing the length of summer vacation, students would have less time to forget what they learned, which could help them maintain their academic skills and performance.  However, some people argue that a shorter summer vacation would be detrimental to students' well-being. They claim that students need time to relax and recharge after a long school year, and that a shorter summer		1
 Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are becoming increasingly common on our roads. As technology advances, the idea of cars that can drive themselves without human intervention is gaining more and more traction. While some people are excited about the possibilities of autonomous vehicles, others fear that they could pose a threat to our society.  One of the biggest advantages of driverless cars is the increased safety they could bring to the roads. Human error is the leading cause of traffic accidents, and autonomous vehicles have the potential to eliminate that risk completely. They would use advanced sensors and cameras to detect objects and obstacles, and adjust their speed and direction accordingly. This would significantly reduce the number of accidents caused by distracted or drunk driving.  Another advantage of driverless cars is the increased accessibility they could provide to those who currently lack the ability to drive. This includes the elderly, people with disabilities, and those without a driver's license. Autonomous vehicles would allow these individuals to travel independently, which would greatly improve their quality of life.  However, some people fear that driverless cars could lead to job losses for those who currently work in the transportation industry. While it is true that self-driving cars could potentially replace some jobs, such as taxi drivers and truck drivers, new jobs could also emerge in fields like vehicle maintenance and software development. The transportation industry has always been subject to change and adaptation, and it is likely that autonomous vehicles will simply be the next phase in this evolution.  In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to the idea of driverless cars. While they could bring increased safety and accessibility to our society, they could also lead to job losses and other challenges. It is important to weigh the pros and cons and carefully consider the implications of this technology before widespread adoption. Ultimately, driverless cars are likely to become a part of our future, and it is up to us to ensure that they are implemented in a way that benefits us all.		1
Dear state senator,  We should not decide the president by electoral college. Mainly because it's unfair to the voters who took the time out of their day to vote, but then realized they wasted their time because their vote doesn't mean anything, the electors decide who the president is not the voters. The article 'The Indefensible Electoral Collge: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong' states "Under the electoral college system, voters vote for not the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." What's the point of voting if our vote basically doesn't matter because we are not the one choosing who is president. The same article also states "Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always" We the voters basically don't even decide who's president, the electors do, and we don't even get to pick who the electors are, the state legislatures do. Why is the president based off of who the electors want? there's only 538 of them, it should be based off popularity, the vote of the millions of the people who have voted. Honestly i see no point in voting now since our votes don't decide who the president will be.  Electoral college is unfair to the small states. The article 'Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president' shows a map of America with the number of electoral votes given to each state. If you look at the map, you'll notice that the bigger states have more electoral votes, and the small states have very few. For example California has 55 electoral votes, Texas has 38, and Florida has 29. But states such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Maine have less than 5 electoral votes. Which basically means that their electoral votes don't count nearly as much as the big states do. If we decided the president by popularity among everyone who voted, it would actually be fair to everyone, and more people would vote.  The article 'Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president' states "Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now" I don't blame them when the artcile also states "This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose presidency." Then what's the point of voting when our vote doesn't matter.                                                                                                                    		0
Dear Principal,  Cell phones are a huge problem in our world today. Letting students bring cell phones into school under any situation, can cause a problem.  More students in our world today use cell phones for texting and just talking to people when they want to. They never use it just for an emergency, and most of a students time is put towards any electronic device. This being said, it would be a very irresponsible thing to do. Students see each other at school all day and week long. When they can't talk to each other in the middle of class they can just simply pull out their phone and start to text each other and the teacher will never know. It just shows students that they can get away with more things than to actually pay attention in class like they need to. The more students do things like sneaking phones in the middle of class, the more it shows them that they can do anything, as long as the teachers don't know about anything that they do. It becomes a habit. It is like a drug that bounds you to it and has you so sucked in that you can't hear or do anything while you're in it.  Students don't need cell phones in school. They have each other to talk to verbally in their spare time. Phones are just going to make it more difficult for the teachers and other authorities to get students under control when they need to. A student shouldn't be stuck up in an electronic device all day long, and especially when they are at school. It is proven that students who pay more attention to a device than read or go outside to get some exercise tend to gain weight and do worse in school. To help less kids end up like this by the time they are done with high-school, the less phones there are in schools the better that students will improve on their grades and social skills, and weight.  These are the important reasons to why cell phones should be in school. It will make schools better and a better life for the students.      		0
 Dear Senator [Name],  I am writing to express my thoughts and concerns regarding the electoral college's effectiveness in selecting the President of the United States. I strongly believe that the current system is fair and should remain in place, as it provides a balanced representation of the country's opinions.  One of the key arguments in favor of the electoral college is that it allows for a more representative election. While it is true that population does not necessarily equal power in the Electoral College, it is also true that a candidate must appeal to a wide range of voters in order to win. A candidate who only focuses on winning over urban or rural areas would not be able to succeed in this system. Furthermore, the fact that each state's electoral votes are equal ensures that every vote is valued equally, regardless of the size of a state's population.  Counterarguments suggest that the electoral college system unduly favors states with smaller populations and disadvantages larger states. However, this argument ignores the fact that the Electoral College is designed to balance out the influence of larger and smaller states. The electoral college system also allows for small, specialized states to have a voice in the election, which is important as it ensures that diverse perspectives are represented.  In short, the electoral college is an effective system that allows for a balanced representation of the country's opinions. Changing the system to popular vote would ignore the diversity of opinions across different regions and only favor the interests of urban and rural areas. I ask that you continue to support the electoral college system and advocate for its continued use in future elections.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages that can improve the quality of life for individuals and communities. The articles provided present evidence and examples from different parts of the world, highlighting the benefits of reducing car dependency.  Firstly, limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, contributing to global warming and air pollution. According to the passage by Elisabeth Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can make a significant impact in reducing these harmful emissions and protecting the environment.  Secondly, limiting car usage can lead to less traffic congestion and improved transportation efficiency. The passage by Andrew Selsky describes how during a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, streets were devoid of traffic jams, and congestion was reduced by 60 percent in Paris during a partial driving ban. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transportation, we can alleviate the strain on the roads and create a more efficient transportation system for everyone.  Furthermore, limiting car usage can promote healthier and more active lifestyles. The passage by Elisabeth Rosenthal discusses how cities like Vauban, Germany, have become car-free, leading to a rise in bicycling and walking. The absence of cars on the streets creates a safer and more inviting environment for pedestrians and cyclists, encouraging them to adopt healthier modes of transportation. This can have a positive impact on public health by reducing sedentary behavior and promoting physical activity.  In addition to the personal benefits, limiting car usage can also have economic advantages. The passage by Elisabeth Rosenthal mentions the growing trend of car-reduced communities in the United States, where the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting such initiatives. By reducing the need for car ownership and promoting alternative modes of transportation, individuals can save money on car expenses such as maintenance, fuel, and parking. This can lead to increased disposable income and improved financial stability for households.  In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring about a range of advantages for individuals and communities. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality, to alleviating congestion and promoting healthier lifestyles, the evidence presented in the passages demonstrates the positive impact of reducing car dependency. By adopting smart planning and embracing alternative modes of transportation, we can create more sustainable and livable communities for future generations.		1
The Development of Driverless Cars  The introduction of driverless cars presents an interesting debate around both their potential benefits as well as drawbacks. While the article "Driverless Cars are Coming" discusses several advantages of these autonomous vehicles, a number of valid concerns remain that warrant serious consideration. On balance, I believe more research is needed before fully embracing their widespread adoption.  Undeniably, driverless cars could solve many transportation issues we currently face. As the article notes, they may reduce traffic accidents caused by human error like distracted driving or drunkenness. By precisely following programming, autonomous vehicles could flow more efficiently on roads without incidents like speeding, reckless lane changes, or other dangerous behaviors. This alone could save thousands of lives annually according to some estimates. They also open up mobility for those unable to drive like the elderly or disabled.   However, the technology is still in its early stages with many unknowns remaining. The article mentions how autonomous vehicles have struggled with unexpected scenarios on the road that their sensors did not anticipate. As the systems have yet to be fully tested over decades of real-world driving like human motorists, there is still a risk of accidents from unforeseen situations or software/hardware malfunctions. Public skepticism around disproportionate reliance on still-limited technology for life-and-death driving decisions is understandable. Moreover, widespread changes will disrupt many existing jobs across transportation sectors.  In conclusion, while driverless cars hold promise in theory, more research and testing is prudent before widespread adoption. As the technology advances to handle a wider variety of scenarios safely and reliably, public trust will grow. But for now, human oversight of autonomous vehicles seems necessary to balance both their abilities and limitations. A cautious, phased approach of introducing driverless cars in controlled settings can help ensure safety as familiarity with the technology increases gradually over time.		1

Online schooling is a relatively new concept that has gained popularity in recent years due to its numerous benefits. As an 8th grader, I believe that online schooling can greatly impact a student's academic performance in a positive way.  Firstly, one of the most significant advantages of online schooling is the decreased distractions. Traditional classrooms can be noisy and chaotic, making it difficult for students to focus on their studies. In contrast, online schooling allows students to learn in a quiet and peaceful environment, free from distractions such as classroom chatter and interruptions. This can lead to better concentration and improved academic performance.  Another benefit of online schooling is the ability to work at one's own pace. Every student learns at their own pace, and online schooling allows them to do just that. Students can take as much time as they need to understand a concept, and they can repeat it as many times as they want until they feel comfortable moving on to the next topic. This can be particularly helpful for students who struggle with certain subjects or who need extra time to comprehend the material.  Moreover, online schooling can also provide better sleeping schedules. Traditional classrooms often require students to attend school during specific hours, which can result in late nights and early mornings. This can lead to sleep deprivation, which can negatively impact academic performance. Online schooling, on the other hand, allows students to learn at any time of the day or night, providing them with more flexibility and control over their schedules.  Finally, online schooling is more convenient than traditional schooling. Students can access their course materials and assignments from anywhere with an internet connection, making it easier to balance schoolwork with other responsibilities such as extracurricular activities or part-time jobs. This can help students to manage their time more effectively and reduce the stress that comes with juggling multiple commitments.  In conclusion, the benefits of online schooling, such as decreased distractions, ability to work at one's own pace, better sleeping schedules, and more convenience, can positively impact a student's academic performance. By providing a more focused and flexible learning environment, online schooling can help students to better understand and retain the material, leading to improved gr		1
Car's. relied on by many people. Used to go anywhere and everywhere. They are comfortable and cool to look at, but are they really as great as everyone think's they are? They pollute, they cause accident's, they destroy the environment and they cost a lot of money and sometimes it's more then people have. Yes, car's make everything easier for you but what happens when there is a bad traffic day and you are already late to work. sometimes car's arent always a great thing.  Gas. The first thing I think of when I hear about car's. They put so many toxin's in to the air that can kill everything around them. In the article it talk's about Paris banning car driving due to the fact that the smog or gas coming from the car's was becoming unbareable. Congestion was down 60% due to the fact that the smog had intensified. Beijing, China happens to be the one of the most polluted cities in the world due to car's. The fuel in car's is pushed out the exhaust pipe when the car is driving which then pollute's the air which make's it hard for thing's that need air such as the surrounding animal's, plant's and human's such as our self's.  Another thing that cause's problem's with car's is the fact that traffic jam's and accident's that are just waiting to happen at any moment. Someone who doesn't know how to drive very well hit's someone else and it cause's an accident leaving people hurt. Not to mention the stress and the road rage that driving put's on people. Going outside and walking to work or going to the park with out all the problem's of being stuck in a car and enjoying the fresh air is a great way to start any day. On the day that Bogota, Colombia decided to have a carfree day people had hiked, biked,skated,and walked. These are thing's that I'm sure people wouldn't have done if they were still allowed to still drive their car.  How would car's drive if they didn't have the road's that we build? How do the road's get there? They get put down where there used to be tree's and land. People destroy and take apart the earth and the put down road's and building's. What do people plan to do when they have taken down all the tree's and used all the space that the earth has to offer? There will be nothing left. Car's are great and all, I understand that they are fast and they make life simplier but people are getting lazy and they are starting to not care about their surrounding's and it's sad.  Car's are not cheap. They take time and money. When a car has a problem or break's down you have to pay to get it fixed. You have to pay to put gas in your car and depending on how much gas your car need's, it can put a hole in your wallet. Car's. We use them, rely on them to take us where we want to go, use them for entertainment such as Nascar and Monster Truck's. One day all the car's will be gone and then what will the world do.		0
 Facial action coding system (FACS) is a method of measuring micro-expressions and muscle movements on the face. It was developed by Paul Ekman, a renowned psychologist, and Wallace V. Friesen, a research scientist, in the 1970s. FACS is used to study and analyze facial expressions to understand emotions, social interactions, and personality traits. This essay will explore the importance of FACS in psychology, its history and how it works.  The history of FACS can be traced back to the 18th century, when scientists such as Charles Darwin used facial expressions to study human behavior. However, it took until the 20th century, with the advancements in technology, that FACS as a formal method of analysis was developed. Since then, FACS has become a crucial tool in the field of psychology and has shown significant contributions to the understanding of emotions and social interactions.  FACS works by using cameras and sensors to measure muscle movements and micro-expressions on the face. The system uses a combination of video analysis, motion detection, and computer algorithms to analyze the data collected. The data is then interpreted by a FACS expert, who identifies the specific muscle movements and micro-expressions being demonstrated.  One of the primary advantages of FACS is its ability to measure subtle changes in facial expressions. These changes, known as micro-expressions, can be used to identify emotions such as anger, fear, and surprise, even when the person is not consciously aware of them. This is important in studying emotions and social interactions, as people often try to hide their true emotions in face-to-face interactions.  In addition to being used to study emotions, FACS has also been used to study personality traits such as empathy, intelligence, and competence. For example, research has shown that people with high levels of empathy are better able to read and respond to nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions.  FACS has also been used to study social interactions, such as negotiations and deception detection. In these contexts, FACS can help identify subtle changes in facial expressions that indicate a person's feelings or intentions.  Overall, FACS is an important tool in psychology that has shown significant contributions to the understanding of emotions, social interactions, and personality traits. By allowing researchers to measure subtle changes in facial expressions, FACS has helped to uncover previously unidentified dimensions of human behavior. Additionally, FACS has practical applications in areas such as emotional intelligence training and deception detection. While FACS does have its limitations and challenges, it continues to evolve and become more sophisticated with further technological advancements. In conclusion, FACS is a valuable tool in the field of psychology that has significantly advanced our understanding of human behavior.		1
 As a scientist at NASA, I cannot in good faith support the belief that the Face on Mars was created by extraterrestrial beings. In fact, after analyzing the data collected from Mars, I believe that this natural landform is a result of geological and atmospheric processes, rather than any kind of alien intervention.  According to the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars," there is evidence that supports this claim. The article reveals that the Face is actually a large, smooth-textured area of dark, reddish-colored soil located on Mars' southern polar ice cap. The dark color of the Face is not caused by any artificial material, but rather by iron oxide, or rust, which is common on Mars' surface. The smooth texture of the Face is also consistent with natural geological processes, as it suggests that the soil was deposited by flowing water.  Furthermore, the Face is not located in any part of Mars that would suggest alien activity. It is situated within a region of Mars that has been bombarded by meteorites and has experienced significant volcanic activity in the past. The presence of these geological features would suggest that the Face is more likely to be a natural landform than an artifact created by another civilization.  It's also important to note that the Face on Mars is not an unusual or unique feature on the planet. In fact, there are other areas on Mars with similar features, such as the "Valles Marineris" canyon, which is over 4,000 miles long and has a reddish-colored surface similar to the Face. The presence of these other natural features on Mars further supports the idea that the Face is simply a product of geological processes.  In conclusion, there is a wealth of evidence that supports the claim that the Face on Mars is a natural landform, and not a product of alien intervention. The dark color of the Face is caused by iron oxide, the smooth texture is consistent with moving water, and the Face is situated in a part of Mars that has undergone significant geological activity. It's important for us to view this natural phenomenon with a rational and scientific mindset rather than jumping to conclusions that lack evidence.		1
Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,  I believe that school activities and sports are very important part of every day student life. If you take away these activities than it will negatively affect many students. These activities provide students with new learning experiences that are very important to some of these students. Taking them away will not help grades at all.  At one point or another, almost every student has gone to one of these school activities or sports. Taking away these after school activities will affect the students in copious ways like there health. Many student s are in clubs after school so that they can easily hang out and have something to do. If they don't have something to do after school besides homework, and they probably won't study, they might try to do something extreme. There are many skateboarders in out school and most of them are in a club regulated by the school to make sure they don't do something too hard, without this guidance many will just try and do all the hardest tricks first. Also since the school does not have an eye on them they could be attacked. The crime rate is rapidly increasing meaning that our student are more likely to be attacked or commit crimes.  On the news a while back there was a story of some kid whose school would not let him go to after school activities because he forgot his homework a couple of times. This made him outraged and every day he was bored. Later on that year he became angry with his teachers because he could not go back to after school activities. One of the local gangs then recruited him and his grades plummeted even more and he started to smash mailboxes and other crimes. When he was charged for these things he said that it was his school's fault because he could not go to the after school activities.  If a student does poorly on his grades it should not mean that all of the after school activities should be stripped from them. There should be a compromise. Maybe instead of just getting there privileges just stripped from them they should get a warning. After getting a warning if there grades do start to improve they are free to go, but if they continue to drop they should have to go after school at least two times a day to study to get back into the clubs. This would help students improve there grades and get back there normal privileges.  Principal TEACHER_NAME, please do not take away school activities and sports just because a student's grades drop. They should get a chance to redeem themselves. Also taking the activities right out from underneath them will leave them falling.		0
The Seagoing Cowboys were great heroes to other country's because they transported food and horses for people who didn't have food or any transportation. Just think how good you would feel if you knew that you saved people lives just by giving them food. Well i'm going to tell you what it would feel like and why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.  Just think of becoming a true life hero, you could become a soldier,nurse,doctor, or a Seagoing Cowboy! Seagoing Cowboys were people (men) who transported Cows, Mules, and Horses. They transported them from America to Europe,Greece,and China. Europe was left in ruins after World War || was over, so people signed up to become a Seagoing Cowboy. They would get on ships with 300+ horses, cows, and mues and enough hay and oats to feed them. A Seagoing Cowboy would check up on them every hour to make sure the animals were alright. Wow what a job.  This story is mainly about how great Seagoing Cowboys are and what they bring to other countries. They transported animals to other countries who didn't have food or transportation. Seagoing Cowboys were true heroes, they cared for animals and people. They had kind hearts for both of them.      		0
Policy 2,  Students like using their phones, but usually don't know when to turn them off during class. There are many times when their caught using the phones during class or other free time. While in school you may see students walking the halls and maybe some have a phone. Should you not allow anyone to use the phones or should they?  When in a class most students are talking to others by texting them from another class. It's harder for the student to do any work and also to bring their grade up if their failing. It's easier if you wouldn't allow them to use the phones during the class time in fact not allow them to use them at all. Even if they had free time they should finish their book or their homework.  Try watching them more often to make shore they don't turn them on they should be aloud to bring them in but not aloud to use them at all. If you see someone use the phone take it from them and give it back at the end of the day. If they continue then take it and tell them if they don't stop they'll never get it back again. If the teacher can't stop it or if you can't tell the parent about it and talk to them. Tell them everything that has happened each day their child has used their phone. If their not satisfied they might take away the phone from their child and only allow them to use it when they are in need of help.  Talk to the students in the school about using phone safety they maybe talking to a friend or someone that claims to be there friend, a student that may not like them. If none of this helps then ban phones from the school and only allow them to use the office phone if a student needs to call someone.  Should you allow them to use the phones? Well no, it may not be so bad a first but once they start getting out of control it'll be harder to pull them away. They should be banned and not allowed, even I don't bring my phone and never need to use it. They should get used to not using them in awhile.            		0
I think that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. How does someone knows others feelings? Well the new technology can notice how someone is feeling. Dr. Huang new computer software stores similiar anatomical information as electronic code. The article states, " Dr. Huang observes that artists studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely to convey specific emotions." I personally think that it should be valuable to use this technology to read student emotions in a classroom. I think it is valuable because you should worry about how your classmates are feeling, you should recognize when a teacher is becoming upset with the class, and also should know when someone is getting confused with the assignment.  In life today more than over thousands of students would want to use Dr. Huang new software. In the article it say, "the computer software can know your mixed emotions." Alot of students today are worried about their surrounding and others' emotions in school. Most student would like to argue that it is not valuable to use this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. Some people might disagree because they'll probably think like,  " worry about yourself and your own emotions." People wouldn't want others to know how they are feeling. " Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication," Dr. Haung predicts.  In a classroom you should always worry about how your classmates feeling. The article predicts, " to notice when someone is happy they indicates the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one." So when your classmates smile like they are forced to they are unhappy. In an unhappy smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatiz major and a different muscle. This tells me to look closely to classmates reactions and smiles. If you look closely to a classmates smile you can recognize how they are feeling. Refering back to the text it states, " faces don't lie."  Secondly, you should recognize when a teacher is becoming upset with the class. Noticing when a teacher is getting upset because the class is to loud and disrespectful, just look at his/her face expression. You should have to use Dr. Huang new computer software to notice when someone is upset. If the teacher is frowning and began to stop teaching they are disappointed. To notice someone emotions it's all about those muscular action units.  How do you know when someone is getting confused, bored, or irritated with an class assignment? By wondering when someone is confused, bored, or irritated look t their reactions. Are they huffing and puffing? Are they sighing? If someone is sighing or huffing and puffing that means that they are either irritated or bored by the assignment. Usually when a student is bored by the assignment they'll just fall asleep.  This essay explains why I agree that the use of this technology to read students emotions is valuable and why others think it is not valuable.                                    		0
People should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program for many reasons. As you go on in the program you can see many features in the world. It can help learn resopnsibilities that you need to learn in the world. In monderen do time it can show you how not to me electionics all the time or so much, because some people can not leave it alone.  This program will show people things in the world that not all people will or will not want to do.

In the United States, the car is king. We rely on our cars to get to work, school, the grocery store, and everywhere in between. But our love affair with the car is coming at a cost. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and they contribute to climate change. They also make our cities less walkable and bikeable, which can lead to obesity and other health problems.  Fortunately, there are a number of things we can do to limit our car usage. We can walk, bike, or take public transportation whenever possible. We can also carpool, rideshare, or rent a car when we need one. And we can support policies that make it easier to get around without a car, such as building more bike lanes and public transportation.  Limiting our car usage has a number of benefits. It can help to improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and make our cities more livable. It can also save us money on gas and parking. And it can be good for our health, since walking, biking, and public transportation are all active forms of transportation.  If we want to create a more sustainable future, we need to start limiting our car usage. There are many ways to do this, and the benefits are worth it.  ## Air quality  One of the biggest benefits of limiting car usage is that it can improve air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and they contribute to smog and other respiratory problems. When we reduce the number of cars on the road, we can improve the air quality for everyone.  ## Greenhouse gas emissions  Cars also contribute to climate change. When we burn gasoline, we release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and warm the planet. By limiting our car usage, we can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow down climate change.  ## Livability  Cars also make our cities less livable. They take up a lot of space, which means that there is less space for parks, sidewalks, and other amenities. They also create noise pollution and traffic congestion. When we limit our car usage, we can make our cities more walkable, bikeable, and enjoyable places to live.  ## Cost  Cars are also expensive. The cost of gas, insurance, and parking can add up quickly. When we limit our car usage, we can save money on these costs.  ## Health  Cars can also be bad for our health. Sitting in traffic for long periods of time can lead to obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. When we walk, bike, or take public transportation, we get more exercise and improve our overall health.  ## Conclusion  There are many reasons to limit our car usage. It is good for the environment, our health, and our wallets. If we want to create a more sustainable future, we need to start making changes to the way we get around.		1
Learning art is a valuable and enriching experience that can be enjoyed by all ages. Throughout history, different types of art classes have emerged, including painting, woodworking, music, drama, and even dance. Famous expressionists such as Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, and Frida Kahlo have helped to promote the importance of art for generations. Musical instruments such as the harp and the flute can often be found in art classes, as well as popular plays like "Romeo and Juliet" and "The Comedy of Errors".   Taking an elective course provides a much more beneficial experience when compared to a required class. Electives allow students to choose classes that offer more interests and learning opportunities that are not necessarily offered in the required classes. This allows them to explore different activities that they may not normally seek out, encouraging them to develop new skills and gain knowledge outside of their traditionally structured courses.   Additionally, allowing students to choose their own electives gives them a level of autonomy, helping to foster independence and creativity. It provides an opportunity for students to find classes that are engaging and stimulating for them, which can lead to more involved learning. This is far more beneficial to having a required class, where the content may not be viewed as exciting or engaging by the student, resulting in a lack of interest and in worse case scenarios, failure.		1
Dear Principal,  I do not think it is right for students to not play any sports, if they do not have at least a B as their grades. For some people it may be hard to get a B as their grades. Students that want to play sports should. They should get at least a C. Some of them may have a weakness in a subject. Some may want to maybe get fit in a sport and make sure their health is good. They cant get that, because they have to get a B as their grades. Then there would be less players in a team of soccer, basketball, or volleyball. Less than half the school will raise their grades up just to be in a sport they may be passionate about. Making the students get a B average to be on a sport could get us students a little upset, because we may not agree on the fact that you do not ask for our opinion. It should be about getting a passing grade, because a C is a passing grade. Many of us have a C average in this school. Please change your mind and see if most of the school agrees or disagrees wit your decision.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME      		0
 Driverless cars: A risky investment  Introduction  The idea of self-driving cars has been around for a while, and many tech enthusiasts and companies have been working tirelessly to bring them to the mass market. Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are designed to operate without human intervention. They use a combination of sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence algorithms to detect obstacles, navigate through traffic, and make driving decisions.  Body  While the concept of driverless cars is undeniably appealing, there are compelling reasons why this technology should not be rushed into the market. One of the primary concerns with self-driving cars is that they can make accidents more likely. According to a report published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2020 there were 36,016 traffic fatalities in the US, and that number is expected to rise as more cars get on the road. Autonomous vehicles are still not perfect, and they can sometimes be unpredictable and unintuitive to human drivers. They also raise questions about who is responsible in case of accidents, and what the legal implications would be.  Another issue with autonomous vehicles is cybersecurity. Self-driving cars rely heavily on software, and any vulnerability in that software could lead to devastating consequences. Hackers have already targeted connected cars, and it is only a matter of time before they set their sights on self-driving models. Cyber attacks could disrupt the flow of traffic, cause accidents, or even steal the car, putting drivers and passengers at risk.  In addition, the cost of autonomous vehicles is currently prohibitively expensive. Self-driving cars require a range of advanced technologies, including sensors, cameras, LiDAR, and high-performance computing hardware. All of those components are expensive, and the cost of integrating them into cars would make them unaffordable for the average driver. Moreover, the cost of maintaining the software and updating it regularly could also be significant.  Conclusion  In conclusion, while the idea of driverless cars is intriguing, there are several reasons why this technology should not be pushed too hard. The risks associated with accidents, cybersecurity threats, and cost make self-driving cars a risky investment. Until these concerns are adequately addressed, it would be wise to approach autonomous vehicle development with caution and caution. It is important to strike a balance between innovation and safety, and we should not lose sight of the potential dangers that come with the widespread adoption of self-driving cars.		1
[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP] [Date]  [State Senator's Name] [State Senator's Address] [City, State, ZIP]  Subject: Support for the Electoral College  Dear [State Senator's Name],  I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and to urge you to continue to uphold this system for the election of the President of the United States. While many argue for a switch to a popular vote system, I believe there are significant advantages to keeping the Electoral College intact.  First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. This system minimizes the possibility of disputes over the election results, as the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College would typically exceed their share of the popular vote. This was evident in the 2012 election when President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of the popular vote. In addition, the winner-take-all nature of most states' allocation of electoral votes leads to landslide victories, reducing the possibility of a tied electoral vote.  Another compelling reason to maintain the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions of the country. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, meaning that candidates must have trans-regional appeal in order to win. This is crucial for a successful presidency, as it ensures that all residents, regardless of their region, feel that their voices are heard and that the President will consider their interests.  The Electoral College also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, which increases engagement and attention from voters. In a winner-take-all system, candidates focus on toss-up states, leading to more thoughtful and well-informed voters who make crucial decisions for the nation as a whole. This focus on swing states ensures that candidates address the concerns and needs of a diverse range of voters, rather than solely catering to regions that are already in their favor.  Additionally, the Electoral College restores balance to the political influence of large states. While the Constitution's mal-apportionment of the Senate may result in a loss of weight for large states, the Electoral College provides them with a mechanism to regain some political significance. This is exemplified by the fact that a close popular vote in a large state like Florida can result in 29 electoral votes, whereas the same margin of victory in a smaller state like Wyoming would only yield 3 electoral votes. By giving large states more attention during the campaign process, the Electoral College ensures a fair representation of their interests.  Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections, preventing complications and uncertainties that arise when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. Instead, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner, avoiding the need to prolong the election process with additional rounds of voting.  While critics argue that the Electoral College discourages potential voters in non-competitive states, it is important to note that voter turnout in presidential elections remains significant despite knowing that their vote may not swing the outcome on a national level. Voters participate in elections to express their political preference, and their engagement is driven by their desire to have their stance represented, rather than the belief that a single vote may decide the entire election.  In conclusion, the Electoral College provides certainty, ensures trans-regional representation, encourages engagement in swing states, balances the political influence of large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While a popular vote system may seem appealing at first glance, the Electoral College has proven to be effective in ensuring fair and balanced presidential elections throughout history. I urge you to maintain and defend this essential democratic process for the benefit of our great nation.  Thank you for your time and consideration. I greatly appreciate your dedication to serving our state and country.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
The Face on Mars Controversy  While photographs of Cydonia Mensa on Mars sparked interest in the possibility of artificial structures, upon closer examination the evidence clearly points to a natural formation rather than alien creation. Three main reasons support considering the Face as a natural landform.    First, images at higher resolution show a lack of precision one would expect from artificial construction. What initially looked like distinct features from a distance become irregular and indistinct as the Viking orbiter captured finer details. A human or alien-made object would maintain clean lines and symmetry up close, not dissolve into ambiguous swirls and slices of eroded rock. As our instruments have improved, so too has our ability to discern natural randomness from intentional design.   Second, geological processes offer plausible explanations for the formation's characteristics without invoking aliens. Erosion by wind is common on Mars and sculpts landscapes over eons. Features like gullies and valleys form gradually through abrasion of softer layers by particle-laden air. The asymmetrical shapes and varying elevations we now see in the Cydonia region fit erosion models. Meanwhile, the apparent resemblance to a human face depends on subjective interpretation rather than unambiguous geometry.   Finally, multiple spacecraft missions have surveyed Cydonia without finding corroborating evidence for artificial structures elsewhere. If the Face were truly an artifact, we might expect to discover tools, buildings, machinery or other signs of nearby habitation. But high-resolution photos show only more of the same intricately sculpted rock outcroppings that the Face blends into. Without additional persuasive context, the isolated Face amounts to an ambiguous natural wonder, not proof of past visitors.  In conclusion, despite initial intrigue, continued observation has ruled out alien construction as an explanation for the Face on Mars. Its irregular shape, plausible geological formation process, and lack of supporting contextual evidence make it far more likely just another curious but natural feature shaped by the Martian environment over eons. While mysteries still abound, this particular enigma has been solved through diligent scientific inquiry.		1
Dear Mr. Principle,  I have been thinking about the problem you have presented us, and I think I have the solution.  As you have told us we have two groups, one of which is opposing the terms of the community service proposition, and the other group which is agreeing with the terms of the community service proposition.  I am part of the agreeing group and I am writing this letter to help support our groups position on this proposition.  Some of the reasons I feel the way I do is because of the way some of the areas where community service projects have already taken place.  There is so much of a difference in the way the place looks and it only took a couple of days with maybe two hours a day!  Now tell me that's a not a good trade off! Better looking landscape and it builds character for the students doing the work.  It also makes the community proud of what it has accomplished and taught its next generation.  If you don't know what i mean when I say, "taught its next generation", I mean taught them that if they better their community they better themselves.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
So your principal is making your whole school do an extracurricular activity. You haven't chosen which activity that you want to do. So then your principal chooses for you and you really hate the activity that your principal gave you. How would you feel if your principal gave you an activity that you didn't like? Would you just go with it or would you try to get out of the activity?  I agree with the principal because I feel that it is important that kids do extracurricular activity for school. Most kids don't do sports or a extracurricular activity after school because they are to lazy to actually do something active. The average kid after school and when they get home will start watching videos on their phone or they will get right on video games. Extracurricular activities could help students make new friends or the activity could be a learning experience. Say you just moved to a new school and your new school is making you do a extracurricular activity. The extracurricular activity could be a good way for you to make a friend at your new school. Some people might not like doing the extracurricular activity that they choose because they think it is a waste of time, but in the long run they might actually enjoy doing the activity after a while. The activity that the student has chose may not be fun at first but they might start to like it overtime. Extracurricular activities may be more fun for others but overall your getting out of your house and being active and not being a couch potato.  Some extracurricular activity maybe more interesting then others like you might have robotics club and your friend has homework club. They both have different benefits like robotics you get to build things like robots, moving vehicles, and stuff out of legos that you can program. Benefit of homework club is that if you need help with a certain part of your homework someone at school could help you. When you get home you don't have any homework so if you like playing video games you are able to play video games when you home without having to worry about having homework that is due tomorrow. Some students when they get home from school don't do anything, but with the extracurricular program that your school is doing. The students will have something else to do after school instead of just hanging out at home doing nothing. With extracurricular activities going on you have more time to hangout with your friends, but when you are at home the only way for you to communicate with your friends is through Facetime, a phone call, or through text. People that do after school clubs have a better chance of actually trying something new then someone who doesn't do after school extracurricular activity because when you do after school activity or club you are trying something new that you might not have ever tried before. Say you join robotics you are trying something new and trying new things will then make you want to try other new things like other clubs or activities.  Some people might already be busy or doing other activities outside of school. So they might not have time for a school extracurricular activity because they maybe doing a sport and then when they get home they have to do homework then by the time all that stuff is done they have to eat dinner, shower, then go to bed. So a school extracurricular activity maybe to much stuff for that one person to do. What if a student doesn't have a ride home or their parents won't be there in time to pick up the student. The student will just be at school even longer if there parent isn't able to pick then up in time.  Some student may not have time for school after activities because they might have other activities that are more important then school activities. People that have activities might not have them everyday so they could go to the after school activities the days they don't have there sports practice going on or other clubs that aren't related to school.  Even if you have a sport going on you could still try to find time to at least do the extracurricular activity once a week, but if you want to do an after school activity and your sport that great but the principal shouldn't be in charge of what you do after school because the principal is only in charge of you in till that last bell rings for dismissal.  The principal made it where everyone has to do at least one extracurricular activity. Most the students like that the principal did that but some students are mad that the principal is doing that because some students don't want to be at school any longer then they already have to and some students like having free time after school. Having to do extracurricular activity can be boring for some, but fun for some people. I feel like the extracurricular activity after school would be a good idea for schools to do. So they have more active students instead of having a student that just don't want to do anything and just want to go home and watching videos and be a couch potato. The program would be a good thing for student but not all student like to active and I feel that if they don't dont want to do the extracurricular activity then I think they shouldn't because when a student doesn't want to the activity then they are just hurting them self by not being active and just being lazy. When a student doesn't want to do the active they are just failing them self because they are choosing to not participate in the activity but when you do participate in your activity that you choose you are being successful because when you start something you should always finish. Overall if you like the activity your doing or not don't complain about it just be happy that you get a chance to have a extracurricular activity. Some kids are unable to because they have to do other things. So be grateful that you get a chance to have a extracurricular activity provided at your school.               		0
**The Use of Facial Action Coding System in the Classroom**  The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions by analyzing facial expressions. In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," author Lisa Feldman Barrett argues that this technology has the potential to be used in the classroom to improve student learning. She claims that by tracking students' facial expressions, teachers can identify when they are bored, confused, or engaged, and adjust their teaching accordingly.  There is some evidence to support Barrett's claims. A study by the University of California, Berkeley found that students who were shown videos of teachers with positive facial expressions learned more than students who were shown videos of teachers with negative facial expressions. Additionally, a study by the University of Pittsburgh found that students who were able to see their own facial expressions while they were learning were more likely to remember the material.  However, there are also some potential drawbacks to using FACS in the classroom. One concern is that teachers may use this technology to punish students who are expressing negative emotions. For example, a teacher might see a student who is bored and then give them a harder assignment or call them out in front of the class. This could have a negative impact on the student's learning and self-esteem.  Another concern is that FACS may not be able to accurately identify emotions. Facial expressions are complex and can be interpreted in different ways. For example, a smile can be interpreted as a sign of happiness, but it can also be a sign of nervousness or fear. This means that teachers who rely on FACS to identify students' emotions may not always be correct.  Overall, the use of FACS in the classroom is a complex issue with both potential benefits and drawbacks. More research is needed to determine the efficacy of this technology and to identify the best ways to use it in the classroom.  **In conclusion, I believe that the use of FACS in the classroom is valuable because it can help teachers to identify when students are struggling and adjust their teaching accordingly. However, I also believe that there are some potential drawbacks to this technology, such as the possibility that teachers may use it to punish students or that it may not be able to accurately identify emotions. More research is needed to determine the efficacy of this technology and to identify the best ways to use it in the classroom.**		1
In America we have lots of cars, lots of roads, leading anywhere you want to go. In Europe they have car free cities where things may run a lot smoother;quicker. Limiting car usage could raise property prices due to lack of highway noise and can protentially save the world from population extinction due to smoke from the tail pipe.  On houses near the highway , of my knowledge, the price is usually lower because you have to suffer the aggonizing pain of the cars honking an zooming past. In the passage "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars""When I had a car I was always so tense. I'm much happier this way," said  Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked the streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out  occasional distant motor." Most American families want to live in quiet and peaceful homes. If cars were to be limited there would be less noise and then there will be a higher value for the houses next to the roadways.  Smoking an second hand smoking is one of the leading causes of death. All cars have a tailpipe and all cars let out ridiculous amounts of gaseous smoke during the average cars lifetime. In an article I read about Paris, titled "Paris bans driving due to smog", the goverment was over-whelmed by the amounts of smog in their city. They proposed a law to restrict drivers from driving on certain days based on their drivers license plate numbers. Thereby reducing the smog in the city. Then when the smog was cleared ramoved the restriction. Less smoke means more fresh air, more fresh air means more healthy and active people running around the world creating more jobs for a better future.  All throughout the world goverment, kings and parliaments are trying to dispel smoking while  cars are one of them, without them there will be higher property values and less greenhouse gases in the air. I believe with less cars in the world we will live a easier life with less coughing and wheezing.    		0
Influencing others is a crucial aspect of daily life, whether it is in personal or professional situations. As an 8th-grade student, I have learned that there are different ways to approach the task of influencing others, and each method has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will compare and contrast talking to someone about my experience versus talking softly and calmly about their behavior. I will also reflect on the consequences of both methods.  When it comes to talking to someone about my experience, I believe that it is important to be clear and concise. This method can be effective if the person is open to hearing what I have to say. For example, if a friend is going through a difficult time, I might share my own experiences with them to help them feel less alone. In this case, I would use a straightforward and honest approach, focusing on the facts of my experience and how it can be applied to their situation.  On the other hand, talking softly and calmly about someone's behavior can be a more subtle approach. This method can be effective if the person is not receptive to a direct approach. For example, if a classmate is consistently disrupting the class, I might approach them in a calm and collected manner, explaining how their behavior is affecting the learning environment for everyone. In this case, I would use a more indirect approach, focusing on the impact of their behavior rather than the behavior itself.  While both methods can be effective, there are consequences to consider. Talking too directly or too indirectly can come across as insensitive or dismissive. It is important to find a balance between being clear and concise while also being respectful and empathetic. Additionally, it is important to remember that not everyone will respond to the same method in the same way. It is important to be flexible and adaptable when trying to influence others.  In conclusion, influencing others is an important skill that can be developed through practice and experience. When it comes to talking to someone about my experience versus talking softly and calmly about their behavior, it is important to find a balance that is respectful and effective. By being clear and concise while also being empathetic, we can influence others in a positive way that leads to better outcomes for everyone involved.		1
Imagine when cars will be nothing but the future. This is actually kind of easy to imagine, but also very mind-blowing to what the future may hold, no? Well, driverless cars are future and it can only get better. They are a big advancement helpfully to our world, and I am definitely for the development they will bring to us and the world.  First of all, driverless cars would become just like a public-transport taxi system, only better. These cars can better improve how we drive, more economically. The smart cars now only "use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus". This will help the environment greatly, because with all the pollution from old cars and diesel semi-trucks, our air quality will not be so good if we do not do something to make it better. These driverless cars will help the environment, and it will not add to the problems we have now. With the cars only getting better, the future driverless cars will only advance more as car manufacturers figure out ways to make travel easier.  Secondly, the driverless car would include combinations of input to help the actual driving going on on the road. These inputs are needed to help "mimic the skill of a human at the wheel". What is the point in a driverless car if it has a driver? There are already cars in our world that can park by themselves and have rear cameras to help with views, but not entirely a car that can do every bit a human can do. The tyes of inputs and sensors the driverless car would have are: position sensors on wheels, sensors on the roof, a video camera for rearview mirrors, a GPS reciever, and a laser that can constantly show us a 3-D mdoel of the car's surroundings. Without all of these features, the car wouldn't be able to actually drive on its own. These sensors will help the driver, (who won't actually be driving) and the car do what it has to do to detect every movement around it.  Lastly, these driverless cars are a big safety improvement to our world. Safety in cars is huge in our world today because we use travel more on big, open roads and highways. Many accidents happen on the road, and when accidents happen, it can be costly and harmful to the driver, their car, and their income. While one is in the car, we always want to make sure we get to our destination without any problems. Car accidents do not happen very often to people, but it is also not entirely rare. The features of the driverless car will ensure safety while driving at all times. Many people still text and drive, which is a big concern while on the road for you and for others also driving. When you have a driverless car, you can do what you need to do, and that includes sending a text. You will have a less risk of getting into an accident. Although the "non-driving driver" will not have to actually put their hands on the wheel because the car does all the work, the driver still has to be focused on the road. The driver must stay attentive to his or her surroudings because if there are road hazards, the driver must come into play and actually take the wheel until the road is free of hazardous conditions. The driverless car will watch you and you will remain watching the road. It is like a team effort, even though the human only comes into play when they are needed.  In all, I am all for driverless cars and its development that comes with it. The cars will be more economical and useful to our public-transport system, the features and sensors that come with it will help the cars drive more smoothly and efficiently, and these cars will better help the world's safety crisis while in a car. Driverless cars are the future, and we are driving ourselves slowly, but surely, onto the road to a better time.		0
Life has revolved around driving since the termination of World War II. In sources 1 and 4, the authors mention the population's inhabitants have greatly reduced or stopped car usage wholly voluntarily. While in sources 2 and 3, the cities have banned car usage on certain days. The advantages of limiting car usage include less pollution and increased accessibility to the entire city.  Pollution is an large issue in todays world. According to Rosenthal in source 1, "passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States P5." The use of cars has created smog in many large cities. The 2009 Olympics in Bejing required the city to reduce car usage in order to clear the air. Those participating and attending the event were in danger of harming their lungs. The citizens of Bejing has already been noted to wear respirators and other devices to filter the toxins from the air they breathe. In this extreme case, it was mandatory to cut the usage of cars down. But in other cities, they have not reached this extreme and it can be easily prevented by limiting car usage. Duffer mentions the pollution in the skies of the global city of Paris has been noticeably decreasedP19. In another scenario of pollution in the atmosphere, the city has taken initiative to ban cars depending on the number of their license plate. Without the emissions from the cars, the air would be clean to breath and a better sight as well.  The new generation has grown up with cars yet when the time comes to obtain a license, they forgo the opportunity. Selsky says that without cars, the city's parks and sports centers have been heavily visited. The pedestrian walkways and shopping centers have also came in large numbersP28. Due to the abandonment of cars, upscale commerce and new restaurants were constructed. Rather than a large mall near some interstate or other large roadway, shopping districts have transformed into locations in which are near public transportation or in walking distance. Rosenthal shares an anecdote that outlines that public transportation, carpooling, and even walking have replaced the car for himself and his childrenP40. Public transit is not viewed down upon anymore, it is a smarter way of getting from one place to another. Carpooling isn't a desprete call, it is a resource that has become essential and benificial to both parties. A combination of carpooling, walking, and public transit makes the city much easier to access and explore.  The development of cities is no longer based on cars. It is now be based upon the access it will give to those without cars. Limiting the use of cars makes the city improved in many ways. Clean air and more efficient ways of transportation highlights that cars are no longer needed and limiting car usage will have even more advantages in the future.		0
We all need help or an opinion on something from time to time, like writing a paper. When we go to get said opinion, we often ask multiple people. It seems like a simple and basic thing, which it is, but why do we do it? Well I believe people look for multiple opinions because the work can be more thoroughly checked, get approval from different types of people, and allows us to socialize with friends.  Having something checked multiple times decrease the chance that somethings wrong. Lets say that while reading an essay you wrote, whoever's checking it over might not notice a misplace comma or a chance to and a richer vocabulary. The more people that read it, the more likely those things will be noticed. Its a very basic concept that is sometimes overlooked. Always make sure to check your work multiple times to find its best form.  Having a variety of people look over your work is a great thing to do. The more people that get to put their two-cents into a work, makes said thing more likable. Like if your writing a short story and your friend who likes comedy gives you their ideas, and then your friend that is into mysteries gives you some tips to make it more suspenseful. There, thats two people with two different personalities and liking's that agree that your story is good. Its a great way to make a story that appeals to a lot of people.  Humans are naturally social creatures. We like to talk to each other a lot, and for good reason. Having a casual conversation with a friend often feels calm and unstressed, clearing your mind. If your really feel unsure about what your creating, having an off-topic conversation with a friend can help you make better choices for what you making. Tranquility is often the key to success.  So why do we look for multiple people when we want advice. It allows us to check our work multiple times to eliminate any mistakes. We can make our work more likable by more people. Finally, talking to people we know well can help us work more efficiently and relaxed. You can make anything ten times better, just by asking for a little help.		0
If I was a scientist I would convience them that the face in the ground was just a natural landform in many ways. Some people around the world think things like this would be great to brag about. In this sitiuation We're trying to convience people and tell them that aliens has nothing to do with this.  In this article, it says that it isn't alien related. Reasons that I would conclude is, as scientists research it is just a landform. Scientists also says that its just another Martian mesa. It's related to the red planet Cydonia. As the one scientist took it among himself and took the picture alot of times just to get a great angle of it everyone was waiting for it. Even web surfers this was a huge impact on the people believing that it was a alien.  As I read more not all the people were ok with the problem. Seems that scientists had found more. If I were a scientist I would gather evidence and all my documents from things that were related to this previous sitiuation.  I would also show them pictures back then of the planet. It would be amazing because as a scientist you should always check for yourself. If you did a previous report on that planet or subject I think you should bring your old evidence and documents out to make things come together to understand better.  In this article, I've learned alot about what scientists go through and they they busy life is. It was exciting reading about this and exploring something like this.                                                		0

Participating in extracurricular activities is a crucial aspect of a student's life. It not only enhances their academic performance but also helps them develop essential skills and build a strong character. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of participating in extracurricular activities, the impact they can have on a student's future, and the ways they can be used to socialize, learn new skills or talents, and avoid or get out of trouble.  Firstly, participating in extracurricular activities can help students develop a wide range of skills, including leadership, teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. These skills are not only important for academic success but also for personal growth and success in the workforce. For example, participating in a school debate team can help students develop critical thinking and public speaking skills, while volunteering at a local charity can help them develop empathy and leadership skills.  Secondly, participating in extracurricular activities can have a significant impact on a student's future. It can help them stand out to colleges and employers and increase their chances of getting accepted into a prestigious university or landing a high-paying job. Additionally, it can help them build a strong network of contacts and mentors who can provide guidance and support throughout their career.

Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:  Taking Your Own Decisions: The Key to Personal Growth  Making decisions is a crucial part of life. It's how we navigate through the ups and downs of everyday life, and it's how we shape who we are as individuals. But have you ever stopped to think about how important it is to take your own decisions? I mean, really think about it?  I know I haven't always been the best at making decisions. Sometimes I rely on my parents or friends to make choices for me, especially when it comes to things that are really important. But as I've gotten older, I've realized that taking my own decisions is essential to growing as a person.  For one thing, when you make your own decisions, you learn to think critically and solve problems on your own. You learn to weigh the pros and cons of different options and make choices based on what's best for you. And trust me, this skill is super important in life. I mean, think about it. How many times have you had to make a tough decision? Like, what do you do when you have to choose between hanging out with friends or studying for a big test? It's not always easy, but when you learn to make decisions on your own, you become more confident and independent.  Another reason why taking your own decisions is so important is that it helps you discover your own values and beliefs. When you make choices based on what you want and what's important to you, you start to figure out what you stand for. And that's when you start to develop your own identity. It's like, you start to see yourself as a person with your own thoughts and feelings, rather than just a follower or a copycat.  Of course, taking your own decisions isn't always easy. Sometimes you'll make mistakes, and sometimes you'll regret the choices you make. But that's okay. That's how you learn and grow. The important thing is that you're taking the initiative to make decisions for yourself, rather than relying on others to do it for you.  So, to sum it up, taking		1
In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This is due to a number of factors, including the increasing cost of gas, the environmental impact of cars, and the health risks of air pollution.  There are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. One advantage is that it can save money. Cars are expensive to purchase, maintain, and insure. In addition, gas prices have been steadily increasing in recent years. By limiting car usage, people can save money on these costs.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can help to reduce air pollution. Cars are one of the major sources of air pollution. Air pollution can cause a number of health problems, including asthma, heart disease, and cancer. By limiting car usage, people can help to improve air quality and reduce their risk of developing these health problems.  Finally, limiting car usage can also help to improve public health. Cars are a major source of traffic congestion. Traffic congestion can lead to stress, anxiety, and even road rage. By limiting car usage, people can help to reduce traffic congestion and improve their own mental and physical health.  There are a number of ways to limit car usage. One way is to walk or bike instead of driving. Walking and biking are great ways to get exercise and fresh air. In addition, they are free and do not produce any emissions.  Another way to limit car usage is to take public transportation. Public transportation is a great way to get around without having to drive. It is also a more affordable option than owning a car.  Finally, people can also carpool or take ride-sharing services. Carpooling and ride-sharing are great ways to save money and reduce emissions. In addition, they can help to reduce traffic congestion.  Limiting car usage has a number of advantages. It can save money, reduce air pollution, and improve public health. There are a number of ways to limit car usage, including walking, biking, taking public transportation, carpooling, or taking ride-sharing services.		1
 I agree with the idea of establishing an afterschool homework club. There are several reasons why I believe this would be beneficial for students. First and foremost, some students may struggle to complete their homework on their own, and having a teacher or mentor to assist them can greatly improve their chances of success. Additionally, not all students have access to computers or other electronic devices at home, which can be a significant barrier to completing homework.  An afterschool homework club can provide a supportive environment for students to work together and learn from one another. It can also give students a chance to interact with their peers and see how others approach similar problems. This can be especially valuable for students who may be feeling isolated or overwhelmed.  Of course, there are potential drawbacks to an afterschool homework club. Some students may take advantage of the situation and cheat off of others, or use the club as an opportunity to socialize rather than focus on their homework. However, if the club is properly structured and supervised, these issues can be minimized.  Ultimately, I believe that the benefits of an afterschool homework club outweigh the potential drawbacks. By providing students with the support and resources they need to succeed, we can help them develop good study habits and improve their grades. This can have a positive impact on their future academic and personal success.		1
I think that studying Venus is really worth a try due to the opportunities that we might be able to study its surface.  Even though we do not have the ability to send machines or humans, we would be able to see what things are on its surface  The author shows that it's a worth pursuit in paragraph 7 when he talks about machines like mechanical computers which might be able to make it there.  He says, "systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."  Another example the author gives in paragraph 5 is that humans can go see Venus with its atmosphere with a technology to keep them safe.  The solution would "allow scientists to float above the fray" which is not a bad idea to keep them from getting hit by flames of radiation.  Traveling to Venus would be good because we humans could see how far we can go and we could expand our technology to a whole new level to study other planets too.  It would expand our goal to many horizons to study its many surfaces and this idea to see what's inside of the most dangerous planets in the universe.		0
 Technology has revolutionized the way we live and interact with the world. From communication to entertainment, technology has made it easier for us to access information, connect with others, and accomplish tasks. However, it has also brought about new challenges, such as cyberbullying and the sedentary lifestyle that comes with spending too much time online.  One of the biggest benefits of technology is the way it has changed the way we access information. The internet has made it possible to find answers to our questions and gather knowledge on virtually any topic. This has made it easier for people to learn and stay informed about the world around them. In addition, technology has made it easier for people to communicate with each other, regardless of where they are in the world. This has made it possible for people to maintain relationships with friends and family members who live far away.  However, technology has also brought about new challenges. One of the biggest challenges is cyberbullying. This is a growing problem that can have serious consequences for individuals who are targeted. Cyberbullying can cause people to feel isolated and alone, and it can even lead to suicide in some cases. It is important for individuals to be aware of this problem and to take steps to protect themselves and others from it.  Another challenge that comes with technology is the sedentary lifestyle that comes with spending too much time online. Many people now order food online instead of going out to eat, and this can lead to a lack of physical activity. This can be harmful to our health, as a sedentary lifestyle can lead to weight gain and other health problems. To combat this, it is important for individuals to make an effort to engage in physical activity on a regular basis, whether it be going for a walk, playing a sport, or simply taking a break from technology to stretch.  Overall, technology has brought about many positive changes in our lives. However, it is important for individuals to be aware of the challenges that come with it and to take steps to protect themselves and others from these challenges. By doing so, we can make the most of the benefits that technology has to offer while minimizing its negative impacts.		1
**Driverless Cars: A Personal Journey**  I remember the first time I saw a driverless car. I was in the car with my parents, and we were driving past a Tesla factory. I was amazed by the sight of this car, which was moving along the road completely on its own. I couldn't believe that such a thing was possible.  As I got older, I learned more about driverless cars. I learned about the potential benefits of these cars, such as reducing traffic accidents and making travel more convenient. I also learned about the challenges facing driverless cars, such as the need for better sensors and software.  I've been thinking a lot about driverless cars lately. I'm not sure where I stand on the issue. On the one hand, I can see the potential benefits of these cars. On the other hand, I'm concerned about the potential risks.  I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up control of my car to a machine. I'm not sure if I trust driverless cars to be safe. But I'm also open to the possibility that driverless cars could make our roads safer and our lives easier.  I'm still on my journey to understanding driverless cars. I'm still learning about the benefits and risks of these cars. I'm not sure where I'll end up on this issue, but I'm glad to be having this conversation.  **The Argument**  In the article "Driverless Cars are Coming," the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. The author argues that driverless cars have the potential to reduce traffic accidents, make travel more convenient, and improve air quality. However, the author also acknowledges that driverless cars raise a number of concerns, such as the potential for job losses, the need for better safety regulations, and the possibility of hacking.  I agree with the author that driverless cars have the potential to make our roads safer. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), over 38,000 people were killed in traffic accidents in the United States in 2020. Driverless cars could help to reduce this number by eliminating human error, which is a major cause of traffic accidents.  I also agree with the author that driverless cars could make travel more convenient. Driverless cars could take us to our destinations without us having to worry about driving. This could free up our time to do other things, such as reading, working, or socializing.  However, I also have some concerns about driverless cars. I'm worried about the potential for job losses. If driverless cars become widespread, many people who work as drivers could lose their jobs. I'm also concerned about the need for better safety regulations. Driverless cars are still new technology, and we need to make sure that they are safe before they are put on the road.  Finally, I'm concerned about the possibility of hacking. Driverless cars are connected to the internet, and this could make them vulnerable to hacking. If a hacker were to gain control of a driverless car, they could cause it to crash or do other dangerous things.  **Conclusion**  I'm still on my journey to understanding driverless cars. I'm still learning about the benefits and risks of these cars. I'm not sure where I'll end up on this issue, but I'm glad to be having this conversation.		1
Driverless cars. Once yesterday's dream is slowly becoming reality. Driverless cars are on the horizon. There's certainly good reason to be excited, but these unpiloted vechicles are still a good while off, if they are to live up to the first word in their name, "driverless". Driverless cars should only be used if the car itself can handle the vast majority of the problems it would face on the road.  Truly driverless cars are driverless, not requiring a driver at all. Today's driverless cars can only perform under few conditions, one being able to handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour. Certainly not ideal in today's society. They need to notify the driver when the road requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. Driverless cars should only be used if the car can handle 95% or above of the driving functions. Getting the driver's attention constantly would be very annoying to the driver, who bought the car so they wouldn't have to do any driving in the first place. Some situations are understandable, I'm sure most drivers would agree, but I would not want a "driverless car" if it can't drive itself. The people interested in these types of cars would want entertainment so they don't have to just stare out the windshield the whole ride, so entertainment options should be available while not sacrificing safety. An added bonus of appealing to a larger market would be to have the option to turn off the artificial driving, and control the car yourself. Not only could it be deadly if something went wrong, but totally relying on the car doing the driving for you, after some time, would ensure that your driving skills are low, thus even more danger if the car malfunctions. Traffic laws currently are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Those laws will change if driverless cars can prove themselves to handle situations on the road, safely. On the issue of liability, we should let laws be put in place before the cars are released to the general public. That way, there is no question who's falt it is if someone's driverless car hits a driver controlled car, one with no option of being driverless or vice versa.  In conclusion, driverless cars should only be released if they meet the safety standards necessary to meet government regulations, while providing the consumer with entertainment, that can easily be turned off by the car if there is a rare situation the car cannot meet. These cars are the cars of the future. Why not make them the best that they can be?		0
Dear Principal,  I believe that community service is a valuable experience for students and that it should be encouraged, but not required.  On one hand, community service can have many benefits for students. It can help them develop a sense of social responsibility, empathy, and compassion. It can also provide them with valuable skills and experiences that can be applied in their future careers. For example, tutoring elementary school children can help students develop their communication and leadership skills, while cleaning up litter can help them understand the importance of taking care of their community.  On the other hand, requiring community service can be seen as taking away time from what students need or want to do. Some students may have other commitments, such as sports, clubs, or family responsibilities, that make it difficult for them to participate in community service. Additionally, some students may not be interested in community service and may feel that it is not a valuable use of their time.  I believe that community service should be encouraged, but not required. By encouraging students to participate in community service, they can still reap the benefits of it without feeling forced to do something they may not be interested in. Additionally, students who are interested in community service can still participate and make a positive impact in their community.  I understand that some people may argue that requiring community service can help students develop a sense of social responsibility and civic engagement. However, I believe that this can be achieved through other means, such as incorporating community service into school curriculum or offering extracurricular programs that focus on community service.  In conclusion, while I believe that community service is a valuable experience for students, I do not think it should be required. Instead, it should be encouraged and made available to those who are interested in participating.  Sincerely, [Your Name]		1
What is something that interests you or a certain subject that interests you? This is a question that schools, who require students to complete summer projects, should ask the students. It is very important to understand what interests the students who are doing these projects. When students are doing a project they are not interested in, they are not as creative with it and they do not learn as much. I know from personal experience that when I am doing a project that interests me, I do so much better and I learn so much more about the subject. It is very beneficial for both the students and the teachers. If some students do not like it or are not interested enough, they might end up not doing the project or getting a really bad grade on it. I believe student-designed projects would be the best way to go because they will learn better and more efficiently, they will get better grades, which is very important, and it will help them learn throughout their break so that they learn so much more.  The first reason that I think student-designed projects would be better, is because they will be more interested in it if they pick something that they are passionate about. The project could be about subjects in school like Math, Science, English, or anything that is related to nature because those are some beneficial things to learn about. I know, from experience, that doing a project that interests you is so much more beneficial. When I was a freshman, my English teacher explained to us that we had to write a paper about something that we are passionate and feel very strongly about. We had to finish this paper by the time our summer break was over. It really helped a lot of my fellow classmates learn so much more about the things they are so passionate about. It was so beneficial to all of us. When we got back to school after summer break, everyone got to share what they wrote about. It was very interesting to hear everyone's point of view on certain things. I really enjoyed it.  Another reason that student-designed projects would be better, is because students can be so much more creative with them. For example, if you really love flowers and you are making a big poster project, you can be so creative with it. You can go out and take beautiful pictures, you can draw and color flowers, and you can search for interesting facts about them. Their are so many interesting things to learn about in the world. Students with creative minds should be given the ability to use them in their own way; therefore, I strongly believe they should be able to design their own projects and be creative and spontaneous with them. In order to do the projects, they still need the teacher's consent, but if it is beneficial and helps them learn, the teacher should be fine with it. It is amazing to see what students can do with all their creativity. The teachers can learn so much about their students' ability when they let them get creative.  The third reason I believe student-designed projects are better, is because it can help both the teachers and the students. If teachers just give every student the same project, some students may decide they can cheat off of their friends, especially if they are not interested in the project or just do not want to do it. If you let them design it and let them do the project about something that they love or are interested in, they will not be able to cheat and will do it on their own. It can also help the students get a better grade on it. If the students are getting better grades on it, then the teachers know that they actually learned something over summer break. I think it is very important to keep learning even over break because it keeps your brain fresh and ready to roll when school comes back around.  It is very important to know and understand what interests your students. Many students are so creative but some never get to use their creativity in school, especially if what they are doing does not interest them. It is very important to let them use their artistic abilities or any other talents they have by doing student-designed projects. Student-designed projects are better for learning and could be beneficial for students in the future even after they get out of school. They can learn many skills from doing them and it will help them continue learning. I strongly encourage teachers to let their students design their summer break projects for not only their benefit, but also for the students'.                                      		0
Sir can I interest you with this flyer about the Seagoing cowboys program. No I' fine but thank you said the man. But sir you don't even know what the progarm is about. Well then tell me replied the man. It's a great and exsiting adventure were you go on a boat acrost the Atlantic or the Pacifac and help the contrys in ruin by bringing animals and food for the animals.  Well but don't you think that I could do more by just donating money asked the man. When you donate money it gets spit up and a small percentege of the money goes to each indevidual contry in need. However with this program you can help a country very effectivly by bringing hundreds of animals overseas at a time. But that sounds like much more work than just donating money. If you join the seagoing cowboys you will get to see many exsiting things and you will be helping more than you could if you just donated money.  Well I do have alot of spare time on my hands since I got fired from my job and nothing else to do said the man. Well then you can join the program and help the countrys in need. You know what I will take a flyer. I garentee you will not be disaponted. Thank you said the man.		0
With technology growing at a rapid rate, many things are being used through online like bank information, communication, and even education. In education there are new way of teaching students. One of them is able to teach from a distance, in which students can attend classes from their homes. Many students would benefit from being able to attend classes from their home, because they can learn anywhere in the world, students would not have to worry about getting ready to go to school, and they can learn at their own pace that lets them understand the topic or subject.  However, many people would not agree with this position, Some might argue that students can get distracted by being at home or that they might not have the same feeling of studying at their home then at school. Some students have difficult challenges in their life that let them not concentrate at their homes like physical or verbal abuse. Some people say that some students that learn through online will not even try to study at home and would get distracted by video games or other forms of entertainment. The idea that a student will learn at school the same as distance learning is thought as something that will never happen. Nevertheless their are other ideas  To begin with, students can learn anywhere in the world. They can travel to other countries or states and still learn as if he or she was still in the class. For example, In my school their are some students that travel to other countries like Guatemala, El Salvador, or Honduras and stay their for a long period of time. One of my friends went to Guatemala for a month because of his family. He knew that he was going to be behind in his classes when he would come back. When he came back, we already did two test and learned two units. He was so behind that it took him quite a long time for him to catch up. If he would have the opportunity of distance learning for the time he was in Guatemala, he would have benefited from it and still been caught up.  In addition, students would not have to worry about getting ready to go to school. Students would not have to worry of waking up early to get to the school bus or to walk to school. They would just have to wake up, eat breakfast, take a shower and go to their computer to start learning. For example, a student lives 45 minutes away from his school and has to wake up at 6 am so he can make it to his first class in the morning. It takes him 30 to 45 minutes to take a shower, eat breakfast, and choose what he will wear. In total it takes him a little bit over an hour to get ready and walk to school. If he would have done distance learning, he would have used that time to complete his homework, study, or to relax a little bit more before his class started.  Finally, Student can learn at their own pace that lets them understand the topic or subject. Many students feel that when they are at school, that the class is going to fast or that the class is going to slow. They could feel more comfortable to either go fast or slow when they learn through online. For example, Many students feel that they learn better when they are outside of school, because their is no distraction that affect them when they are at a library or their home. Distance learning can make many students learn at their own pace and practice to understand for their tests.  In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. They would be able to learn from anywhere in the world, students would not have to worry about getting ready to go to school, and students can learn at their own pace that lets them understand the topic or subject. Many might not agree with these ideas, but they have to realize that distance learning is an option for students to understand at their pace and feel more comfortable when they learn at their homes. 		0
Participating in Unique Adventures  As a lifelong cowboy, I was eager to try something new and exciting when I learned about the Seagoing Cowboys program. Having grown up riding horses on the range, I was ready for an adventure that would allow me to see more of the world. The opportunity to take my skills out on the open water as a Seagoing Cowboy was truly one of a kind.   There were so many reasons the program appealed to me. First and foremost, I would get to visit beautiful, remote locations that few people ever see. As the article described, our group traveled to places like a lighthouse off the coast of Maine and rocky shores along the Pacific Northwest. As someone who has spent his life in wide-open spaces, seeing dramatic ocean vistas and seaside cliffs really opened my eyes to new landscapes. I also loved learning about the history of each place we stopped and getting a taste of local culture.  Another big draw was using my animal handling experience in a completely new setting. Herding cattle on a rocky boat was a real challenge that tested my skills in unexpected ways. Adapting my techniques on the unsteady deck taught me so much about working with livestock in all conditions. I felt an immense sense of accomplishment after each successful drive. The program also strengthened my problem-solving and leadership abilities as our group worked as a team on the high seas.   Overall, participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program allowed me to grow both personally and professionally. I was pushed far outside my comfort zone but rewarded with breathtaking scenery and memories that I will forever treasure. For anyone wanting an adventure that is educational, rewarding, and totally unique, I highly recommend applying for this one-of-a-kind opportunity. The seas may be uncharted waters for a cowboy, but the voyage is absolutely worth it.		1
Driving using a phone?  When you are driving down the road and you get a phone call do you wait till you stop to answer it. Or do you answer immediately while your hands in the wheel. Do you think people should do that?  In my opinion i think people should not be able to use their phone but only on emergency. Have something to hold your phone up or a magnet on your dashboard. So if you get a call or text you dont grab and only using a finger and tap quick to answer it. Instead of grabbing it and putting it up to your ear. Doing that can prevent less crashes in my opinion because you you just give your phone a glance and a quick tap instead of holding it and trying to multi task looking at a phone and drive. By doing that you can be looking at the road and still give your phone a glance.  If you aren't allowed to use your on while driving. What happens if your wealthy businessman and you don't have anything bluetooth to talk to the person. How would you solve that problem but also that can be dangerous because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy.  Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.  People say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. But its a risk of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is Onstar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency they will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact the nearest police, hospital and fire department giving them your exact location. Nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.  In conclusion if people don't stop using phones while driving the percent in people dying in car crashes won't change.   		0
I'm just an AI, I don't have have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide information and arguments for and against the use of animals in scientific research.  Argument Against the Use of Animals in Scientific Research:  1. Animal cruelty: The use of animals in scientific research can involve harming, hurting, and killing animals, which is considered animal cruelty. Animals are living beings with feelings and the ability to experience pain, fear, and stress. It is not ethical to subject animals to such treatment, especially when alternative methods are available. 2. Lack of scientific validity: Some argue that animal testing is not an effective way to predict human reactions to drugs or other substances. The biology of animals can differ significantly from humans, leading to inaccurate results. For example, a drug that is safe for animals may not be safe for humans, or vice versa. 3. Unnecessary suffering: Animals used in research are often subjected to extreme and prolonged suffering. They may be forced to inhale toxic substances, exposed to radiation, or undergo painful procedures that are not necessary for human health. 4. Cost-effectiveness: Animal research can be expensive, and the cost of using animals can outweigh the benefits. Alternative methods, such as computer simulations and in vitro testing, can be more cost-effective and produce more accurate results.  Argument For the Use of Animals in Scientific Research:  1. Medical advancements: Animal research has played a crucial role in the development of many life-saving treatments and medications. Animal testing has helped scientists to understand the causes and effects of diseases, develop new treatments, and test their safety and effectiveness. 2. Reduction of harm to humans: Animal testing helps to reduce the risk of harm to human subjects. Before a new drug or treatment is tested on humans, it is typically tested on animals to ensure that it is safe and effective. 3. Scientific discovery: Animal research has contributed to a greater understanding of biology and the development of new scientific theories. For example, research on animals has helped scientists to understand the role of genetics in the development of certain diseases. 4. Limited alternative methods: Some scientists argue that there are limited alternative methods to animal research, particularly in fields such as neurology and psychology, where animal models are considered essential for understanding complex brain functions.  Conclusion:  The use of animals in scientific research is a controversial topic that requires careful consideration of ethical principles. While animal research has contributed to significant medical advancements, it is important to ensure that the use of animals is justified and that alternative methods are explored. It is essential to strike a balance between scientific progress and animal welfare.		1
community service  I think they should let the kids do what they want. i think if they might say they have something to do they could. some other kids might say they cant because they have something to do but they really don't. i think its nice if they do community service to help out or other kids. i think other kids should maybe do community service to help other people and they could do it to help other kids how to read or something. maybe some other kids already have other stuff planned and some of them might think they have to do other stuff and but they really want to help out. i think if other students help clean up litter that is a good thing.  I think other kids should try to help out and not try to make stuff up and help. some other people care than others and they will help out but i don't think they should get forced to do it and help out. if other people could take some of there time after school or something i think that would be a good thing to do.  Other kids or people might not like being around other people like that and some other people could be fine with that. sometimes people don't like that because maybe grown up like that and it bothers them to be around other people.		0
 It's important that students have a break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. As a student, I believe that these breaks would be beneficial for me and my peers. In my opinion, having a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall would allow us to relax, spend time with our families and friends, and engage in fun activities.  During the summer, I enjoy going on adventures with my family. We like to travel, visit new places, and try out different activities. However, when I'm in school, I don't have much time to spend with my family. Between homework and studying, I often feel like I'm constantly busy. Having a longer break in the summer would give me the opportunity to catch up with my family and friends, and do things that I enjoy.  In addition to traveling, summer is also a great time to try out new hobbies and activities. Whether it's going to the beach, playing sports, or trying out a new hobby, there are endless opportunities to have fun. Having a break in the summer would give me the chance to explore new things and try out new activities.  In conclusion, I believe that having breaks is important for students. It would give us the opportunity to relax, spend time with our families and friends, and engage in fun activities. Having a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall would be beneficial for me and my peers.		1
We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral College is corrupt compared to popular vote. They're more cons than pros about the Electoral College. A lot of people agree that we should change our voting to popular vote. Electoral College voting should not be the way we vote for something so important.  The Electoral College System is wrong. In source two, Bradford Plumer said that "under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president". You have no clue who your voting in with the Electoral College system. Plumer also said "they can be anyone not holding public office" and "electors could always defy the will of the people". Do you really want someone who you dont know and can't trust to be an elector? If you wanted someone like that you might as well let a child do the job. In source one the Office of the Federal Register said "when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors". More than one source said that you vote in electors when voting for a your candidate.  The Electoral College system is said to be unfair to voters in source two. The Electoral College system has a "winnertakeall" system. Which means if a Democrat candidate wins they will have Democrat electors and if a Republican wins the will have Republican electors. In source one the Office of the Federal Register also said that the "winnertakeall" system "awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate". This is not fair to the voters or the United States. If a tie happened it would be even more unfair to voters. if a tie did happen the House of Representatives would break it. In source two Plumer said "the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. If the voting doesnt even show your will why vote? Plumer also said in source two that "the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational". I agree with plumer, the electoral College needs to go.  Even though the Electoral College has a lot more cons than pros they have some pros. In source three Posner give you the "five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President". Posner said the first reason was "certainty of outcome". The second reason is "the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal". the third and fourth reason is "swing states" and "big states". the fifth reason is the Electoral College system can "avoid runoff elections". These are all pros of keeping the Electroral College, but are they really worth it? Would you rather have these pros compared to having fairness?  We should abolish the Electoral College and change the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. Popular voting is alot better for everyone. The pros of popular voting excedes the pros of the Electoral College. Popular voting gives everyone a fair chance and doesnt just have a "winnertakeall" system. it actually gives both political parties a chance. I agree with source two when it said "Abolish the Electoral College!".		0
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I support policy two because if they have cell phones during free periods and lunch it could cause physical and emotional harm to others because they might run into each other while walking around or be spreading rumors about other people, And it would not be fair to the people who don't have phones or not allowed to bring there phones, and if they were allowed to have phones during those times they might have just took a test and be telling the other people the answers to it, or they might start a conversation that they didn't get to finish in that time and still use it in the middle of class. it might also effect there behavior in the next class they go to or it could effect there grades, they could also lose track of time or not hear when they are supposed to come back inside school to start class again, they would also use them in the halls that could cause a fight or someone dropping their phone or someone running into another person causing injuries or arguments.

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This is due to a number of factors, including the environmental impact of cars, the cost of owning and operating a car, and the health risks associated with driving.  One of the main reasons to limit car usage is the environmental impact of cars. Cars produce emissions that contribute to air pollution, climate change, and smog. In addition, the mining and refining of the materials used to manufacture cars also has a significant environmental impact.  The cost of owning and operating a car can also be a major barrier to car ownership. The cost of a car itself, as well as the cost of insurance, gas, and maintenance, can be a significant financial burden for many people. In addition, parking can be expensive, especially in urban areas.  Finally, driving can be a health risk. Traffic congestion can lead to stress and anxiety, and it can also contribute to air pollution. In addition, car accidents are a leading cause of death and injury.  There are a number of ways to limit car usage. One way is to walk or bike instead of driving. This is a healthy and affordable way to get around, and it also helps to reduce air pollution. Another way to limit car usage is to take public transportation. Public transportation is a convenient and affordable way to get around, and it also helps to reduce traffic congestion. Finally, people can also carpool or take ride-sharing services. This is a convenient and affordable way to get around, and it also helps to reduce air pollution.  Limiting car usage has a number of benefits. It can help to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, and save money. It can also be a healthier and more enjoyable way to get around. If you are looking for ways to reduce your environmental impact, save money, or improve your health, consider limiting your car usage.		1
Dear TEACHER_NAME,  I disagree with the decision you took for changing the grade average to participate in sports or other activities. There many reasons on why I disagree with your decision. First, our athletic students in our school are not smart and usually get C' s on their report card. If you change the grade average, those students won't be able to participate in school sports. If the school's athletic students can't play then the sports department will suck and be awful. A awful sports department will look bad for our school and cause other schools to insult our sports department. Would you like that? Another reason is that a C average is a decent grade. It is way better than a D or a F. Our school district says that a C and above is passing. So why can't the grade average to participate in sports be C? Thirdly, many students in our school have C average and if you change it to a B average, then not many students could tryout for sports and less students trying out won't give the coaches to many students to choose from. In some sports, less students will tryout and then that sport won't have a full team. Lastly, changing the grade average to a B will cause hatred from the students towards you. Will you like having students upset and angry at you? I hope you understand my point of view and take the correct decision.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
Some people believe that the electoral college should be abolished and some people believe that the electoral college has helped us throughout the years. But I believe that electoral college should be abolished.  The reason I believe that the electoral college should be abolished is because I don't believe it is benefiting any elections at all. And a lot of people do not believe in it either. In source two Bradford Plumer said "what have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce been trying to do, abolish electoral voting." I think that the electoral college makes the president elections to close to tie, and that could be a catastrophe. However source three has made some pretty good points on the electoral college. Saying that " if there was no electoral college there would be no winnertakeall system." this would a terrible problem for the candidates and the voters, and would ruin the whole election.  Therefore sources two and three makes some pretty valuable and good points, but I still think source two makes more sense to me. In source three Richard A. Posner wrote " it is the electors who elect the president not the voters. When your voting for a president candidate your actually voting for a slate of electors. I dont agree that electors decide what we voted for, because then whats the point of voting for a candidate if your not even choosing at all. America is a democracy and having someone choose your president for you is not showing that we live in a democratic nation. We need to choose so we can learn from our own mistakes and then we won't make them again.  This just shows that the House Of representatives and the government don't trust us at all and that we cant make good decisions. Source one doesnt say anything about being against or with it but it did point out some interesting facts about the electoral college. The office of the federal register wrote " the electoral college is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens." What their saying is that we might not have huge say on the election but we do have a pretty big say on it. I don't that we have any say on it what so ever, and that is because of the slate of electors.  In conclusion, I agree with what source two had to say because of the great points they made and the facts that led me to belive that the electoral college does not work at all. Read the sources and then tell me if you think i'm right or wrong.		0
Imagine being able to detect someones emotions? First, how does this new technology work. Second, the values it has in the schools. Third, it can make it easier detect someones emotions. This is why technology that reads emotions can be very useful.  First, how would the new technology detect the emotions? The Facial Action Coding System is how. This innovation was created by Dr. Paul Eckman. The process starts with the computer constructing 3-D model of faces. It also, models the 44 major muscles that have to move like humans. By using video imagery, the software tracks the facial movement to recognize the emotions.  Second, the effects it has on the school could be outstanding. What if the school computers could tell a student's emotions? The computer could recognize if the student is bored or confused. The computer could modify what the student is learning to something more effective. This way would be easier on the teacher, so they won't have to come up with new lesson plans.  Third, it can easily detect someones emotions. They have used the new technology on Leonardo da Vinci panting of Mona Lisa. In the painting it's kind of hard to tell her emotions. The new technology find she's 83%, happy 9% disguted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. If this technology can detect a painting emotions like this easily, just imagine how easy it would be to detect on a human.  In Conclusion, technology that reads emotions can be very useful. First, how it's uesd. second, the value it has in schools. Third,it can make it easier to detect someones emotion.		0
 Facial action coding system (FACS) is a comprehensive system of measuring human facial expressions that was developed by psychologist Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen in the 1970s. This system is based on a set of 68 facial movements that underlie a wide range of emotions, including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, contempt, disgust, and dislike, among others.  FACS is considered a highly reliable and valid method for measuring facial expressions, and it has been used in various fields, including psychology, anthropology, sociology, and neuroscience. In psychology, FACS has been used to study the neural mechanisms underlying facial expressions and emotions, as well as to investigate individual differences in emotional expressiveness.  The FACS system is based on an analysis of subtle changes in muscle activity that occur when facial expressions occur. Facial muscles are divided into six groups, each of which corresponds to a basic expression. These groups include the forehead muscles (for example, those that raise eyebrows), the eye muscles (for example, those that increase eye height), the inner eyebrows (for example, those that contract above the eyes), the cheeks (for example, those that bulge outward), the jaw (for example, those that form a tight smile), and the lips (for example, those that move up and down).  The FACS system relies on the identification of these facial movements and combinations of facial movements, and the measurement of their intensity, duration, and timing. Facial movements are scored on a six-point scale, ranging from none (0) to full (5), with intermediate scores indicating varying degrees of expression. For example, a smile might be rated a "1" if only the mouth is slightly open, while a "5" might indicate a wide grin that engages both the eyes and the mouth.  FACS analysis has been found to be sensitive to individual differences in emotional expression, as well as to cultural differences in facial expression norms. Studies have shown that some individuals are more expressive than others, and that cultural factors can influence the types of facial expressions that are considered appropriate in different contexts.  Overall, the FACS system provides a powerful tool for studying human emotions and facial expressions, and has contributed significantly to our understanding of the neural mechanisms and individual differences underlying emotional expression.		1
When making decisions people often look to others for advice. Whether the decision be where to go for lunch or something that would alter your life people seek others opinion. Often times going to more than one person to get advice can be a very beneficial thing to do. Getting more than one opinion can be very helpful since it gives you more outlook on the question at hand. By asking more than one person you get multiple sides of your situation, their past experience in doing something similar, and in the end you will be more confident in your final choice.  Going to other for advice can really open your eyes to all sides of your dilemma. Perhaps you want to apply to a school and are having a hard time deciding whether to apply or not. Asking someone who may have gone to that school or had experience with something like that would be helpful because they know what its like. Then for another opinion talk to someone close to you like a friend or a family member to see if they think it would be a good fit for you specifically. These people also may see things that you dont in a situation. Seeing multiple sides of the decision in question really helps to make a clear decision.  Some of the people you would want to talk to probably have more experience than you do. This would be optimal considering they have already gone through something very similar and know which choices have a bad outcome. A family member, close friend, or anyone you trust really would be a good option for this. If they are older than you its likely they had to make some similar decision and will relate to you and your situation and try their best to help aid you in making a good choice. These people that have more experience in life and are willing to help you really make the difference and help you make the best choice possible.  After asking all these people and taking into consideration all of their opinions there should be a pretty clear final decision. Since you've asked all of these people you should be able to confidently make a good choice that will benefit you. Going into something like a job or a try out is optimal for success. All in all more opinions makes a stronger and more sound conclusion to the problem at hand.  An example of this from my past experience would be when I tried out for junior varsity softball at Generic_School. I wasnt sure if trying out was gonna benefit me at all considering i'm in 8th grade and many of the girls out there have many more years of experience. I went to my dad for advice since he played junior varsity and has also seen me play. In his opinion he didnt think I should try out because its a lot to take on during 8th grade. Then I went to some of my friends for their opinion on it and they gave me the confidence to go and try out. Right now Im on the softball team and very happy with the choice I made to try out.  In conclusion, asking more than one person for their opinion on a problem is very beneficial. By asking more people you can see all different sides of the question. These people have different experiences which could cause them to see things that you cant. Having all of these different sides should make it so your final decision is something you can be happy and confident with.		0
Cars are used used in everyday life but they may be used too much because of all the damage they do to the environment and the citizens must be informed on it. Cars are used to help get around easier unless if towns are developed so that people can walk or ride a bike everywhere. Cars cause pollution which causes smog and it can really hurt peoples health and the environment. A life without cars can make plenty of people happy due to the fact that people get injured or die in cars every day.  To start off most towns do not build buildings close together because people have cars which takes up more time to get there and money for gas. If buildings were made closer together everyone could get to the stores quickly and back home in time for special events. If buildings were made closer gasoline would be less of a problem due to the prices being high. In a town called Vauban in Germany seventy percent of all families do not own an automobile."All of our development since World War two has been centered on the car,and that will have to change" said David Goldberg.  Cars are known to cause pollution and some places have a partial ban on cars. Paris is well known for the Eiffel Tower and also its pollution problem so Paris allowed people with even and odd number license plates to only drive on certain days or else they will be fined. When cars cause pollution it makes smog and smog can kill crops and animals if it gets out of control. Currently heavily populated areas such as Newyork has a big pollution problem causing grey skies.  A life without cars is a happy one according to some people. A place in Colombia calles Bogota made an event called "Car-free day" which is a day where everyone goes the entire day without driving "It's a good opportunity to take away streaa abd lower air pollution"."These people are generating a revolutionary change and it is crossing boarders"."The rain hasn't stopped anyone from participating".  The reasons people should cut down on car usage is to lower pollution in the air. It just makes people happier without vehicles. Towns could be made with closer buildings to prevent using too much gas. Smog can really make an environment unhealthy by killing some of the plants that are there.    		0
**The Use of Facial Action Coding System in the Classroom**  In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," author Joi Ito discusses the potential of a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to identify human emotions. FACS uses a series of 44 muscles in the face to create a "universal language" of emotions that can be recognized by computers. Ito argues that this technology could be used to improve education by helping teachers understand and respond to the emotional needs of their students.  There are a number of potential benefits to using FACS in the classroom. First, FACS could help teachers identify students who are struggling emotionally. This information could then be used to provide students with the support they need to succeed. For example, a teacher who notices that a student is frequently frowning or avoiding eye contact could talk to the student about what they are going through and offer them some assistance.  Second, FACS could help teachers create a more positive learning environment. By understanding the emotional needs of their students, teachers can adapt their teaching style to meet those needs. For example, a teacher who knows that a student is easily frustrated may be more patient and understanding when that student makes a mistake.  Finally, FACS could help teachers improve their communication with students. By being able to read the emotions of their students, teachers can better understand what their students are thinking and feeling. This information can then be used to build stronger relationships with students and create a more productive learning environment.  Of course, there are also some potential drawbacks to using FACS in the classroom. One concern is that teachers could use FACS to monitor students' behavior in a way that is intrusive or even oppressive. For example, a teacher could use FACS to track which students are paying attention or to identify students who are misbehaving. This could lead to students feeling like they are being constantly watched and judged, which could have a negative impact on their learning.  Another concern is that FACS is not always accurate. The human face is a complex and ever-changing landscape, and even the slightest change in expression can be misinterpreted by a computer. This could lead to teachers making incorrect assumptions about their students' emotions, which could lead to negative consequences.  Overall, the potential benefits of using FACS in the classroom outweigh the potential drawbacks. By understanding the emotional needs of their students, teachers can create a more positive learning environment and help students to succeed.  In conclusion, I believe that the use of FACS in the classroom is a valuable tool that can help teachers improve their understanding of their students and create a more productive learning environment. However, it is important to be aware of the potential drawbacks of this technology and to use it in a responsible manner.		1
Hey there!   Technology has definitely had a huge impact on our lives, and it's hard to imagine life without it nowadays.  I mean, think about it  ?we can communicate with people all over the world through social media, buy stuff online, and even cyberbully each other!  But, like, there are also some really cool things about technology too, like how it's advanced so much over the years.   So, let's start with the positive stuff.  Communication is way easier now. We can send messages, make video calls, and even share pictures and videos with people in real-time.  It's like, super convenient, especially for long-distance relationships or when you want to catch up with friends who are far away.  And shopping online is also a thing now, which is pretty cool because you can find anything you want and have it delivered right to your doorstep.  It's like, so much easier than going to the store and dealing with crowds and stuff.   But,  there are also some negative things about technology.  Like, cyberbullying is a thing now, and it's really hurtful and mean.  People can be so mean online, and it can really affect people's self-esteem and mental health.  And sometimes, I feel like we're all just staring at screens all the time, and it's like, really bad for our eyes and stuff.   But,  technology is advancing so much over time!  Like, remember when we used to play games on Gameboys?  Now we have these super advanced gaming consoles that are like, way better!  And smartphones are like, way more advanced than they used to be too.  We can do so much more on them now, like watch videos and take pictures and stuff.   So,  overall,		1
 Here is an essay written from the perspective of a high school student named Luke, persuading others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program:  When I joined the Seagoing Cowboys program, I never imagined the incredible experiences and adventures that awaited me. From visiting unique places to making new friends, the program offered me a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that I will always cherish. Here are just a few reasons why I believe others should consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program:  First and foremost, the program allows you to travel to different parts of the world and experience diverse cultures. As a cowboy, I was able to visit countries such as Korea, Japan, and the Philippines, and learn about the local customs and traditions. This exposure to different cultures not only expanded my understanding of the world but also taught me valuable lessons about diversity and acceptance.  In addition to cultural experiences, the Seagoing Cowboys program also provided me with the opportunity to make new friends and connections. The program brought together a group of like-minded individuals who shared my passion for adventure and exploration. Through this community, I made lifelong friends who have supported and inspired me in my personal and professional endeavors.  Another reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys program is the sense of purpose and fulfillment it provides. As a cowboy, I was able to contribute to the program's mission of providing humanitarian aid to those in need. From delivering supplies to helping to build schools, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment in knowing that I was making a difference in the lives of others.  Overall, my experience with the Seagoing Cowboys program was truly transformative. It allowed me to explore the world, make new connections, and give back to those in need. I highly recommend the program to anyone looking for an adventure of a lifetime and a chance to make a positive impact on the world. So, join the Seagoing Cowboys program and embark on your own incredible journey!   Sorry if there were any grammatical mistakes, I'll do my best in the future to check my essays before submitting them.		1
In Europe, a new trend has started. Many towns have banned the ownership of cars. One town that this happened in is Vauban, Germany. In this town, citizens are living lives without a lot of stress. They enjoy riding tandem bikes with their wives and walking alone. In Paris, the act has been picked up. Since it's so popular, Paris streets hold many cars. Now that the temporary law has passed, the amount of smog has dropped dramaticaly.  When cars aren't used, lives are saved. Car accidents happen very often and oftentimes they are fatal. When you have a car, you become able to get a DUI. Owning a car can bring you extensive fines, even when you make a small accident in a fraction of a second.  With the economy the way it is, who can even afford a nice car? Bikes are much cheaper and safer for people as well as the environment. If everyone in the world stopped using their cars for a month, we might be able to save a species from dying out, or maybe slow the desintegration of the ozone layer. In Yosemite, wolves flee from the roads because of the massive amount of death it causes their species.  Suburban cities are working on making everything walking distance. On the weekends, public transportation is free. If you have an electric car or you're carpooling three or more people, you're allowed to drive in these cities. Because of these new laws that are being tested in certain areas, many people don't have their licenses. Many teenagers today aren't concerned with being able to drive, and many adults live close enough to their workplace to walk there. Although the laws restricting driving can seem very restricting, they will save lives and will give society a chance to have a smarter, cleaner, and safer future.         		0
Success is something many of us strive for, and many believe it is attainable through hard work and dedication. Achieving success often requires enthusiasm, education, and family support. Enthusiasm and motivation are critical for powering through hard work and obstacles, and education can provide the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed. Family support can provide needed encouragement and moral support to persevere when going through trying times.  However, jealousy and envy from others can hinder success if we let it. Unfortunately, when successful people are admired or their achievements praised, it can often breed envy or jealousy in others, which can be damaging to both the successful person and those who feel envious.  A plan for personal success should include setting and maintaining goals, developing a positive attitude, and consistently making efforts and putting in the necessary work to reach the desired objectives. Self-belief and perseverance are essential components of success, and it is important to be prepared for the possibility of failure. When faced with failure, it is critical to take the time to reflect on the experience before moving on and finding alternative paths.  In addition, it is important to stay open to creativity and new ideas along the way. Keeping secrets can be detrimental to success as well, since making connections with other people and building a strong network are crucial elements of achieving success. Having an open mind and being open to learning new things is essential, and maintaining focus on goals despite external pressures is a must. With the right attitude, enthusiasm, education, and family support, success can be within reach.		1
There are many different opinions about the whole "Driverless Cars" idea. They're good, they're bad, etc. Why are they so good or bad? Well in my opinion they are a very bad thing. "Driverless Cars" are a very bad thing for multiple reasons.  First, there's the increased risk of an accident. Sure technology is highly advanced now a days, but that doesn't mean there are zero problems. "If the technology fails", there is always a chance that something could go wrong. For example, how many times has your phone crashed or shut down on you? That could very likely happen to your driverless car. I know I wouldn't want a malfunction in my car and not be able to get anywhere, let alone get in an accident because something went wrong in my car.  Secondly, it's encouraging our already lazy society to be even lazier. Everywhere you look there's someone being lazy. For example, instead of going outside on a nice day kids will play their video games or they will find an easy way to get something done quickly (shoving stuff under the bed instead of putting it away). All people do now a days is sit on there high tech devices. "Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?" These cars will just be that much more of a reason for people not to do something. "[T]he dream of calling a driverless cab to take us wherever we desire, [. . .] has finally begun ot catch up". As soon as there are "official" driverless cars people wont have to worry about "drunk driving", speeding, falling asleep, etc.  Finally, the financial cost of all of this. Everytime something new comes out it's expencive and "high class", but everyone still wants it. If driverless cars become an actual thing then they're going to be high priced. Plus the production of them will be just that much more expensive. The United States already has enough debt to deal with why would we want to put ourselves in even more? Sure people would still buy them, but if the police can't ticket anyone for speeding then we loose money from that. Car accidents are one of the leading causes of injury. If the driverless cars happen to help with less accidents then hospitals would loose major profit from car accident pacients.  Of course, if the technology was perfect, the cars could benefit in a lot of ways. As we all know, though, technology isn't perfect. Which is exactly why the "Driverless Cars" are a terrible idea for our society. There are too many flaws with the idea of driverless cars. That is why I would not feel safe or comfortable in one.		0
The author is saying that the journry to Venus, despite it being very dangerous, is very worthwhile in the long run. The reasons why are a myraid and the reasons why not are the same likewise.  A great reason for why the we should travel to Venus is that Venus is our sister planet and could have had an ocean at one point. From all we know most life starts from water and if Venus once had oceans on its surface that could vary well mean that it has had some form of life on it at one point. If this were true then it would be a tremonus discovery for it would be the first life found that does not come from Earth. The evidence for this claim of oceans once touching Venus's surface is that it has mountain, vallys, craters, deep tenches that Earth similarly has when it comes to it's oceans.  Sadly however, the trip to Venus would be very exspencive and very very dangerous. Venus has a constant wave of violent storms, is constantly having volcanic eruptions, it's clouds and air are acidic and it's air pressure on it's surface is incredibly stronger than even our deepest of oceas. Not to mention that is comes into around 800 degrees normally. The evidence for this are in paragraphs 2-3 when it states that many unmaned aircrafts have been sent and none have been retuned do to them being destroyed.  Another positive is that if a sucsseful trip to Venus was made then it would mark a major shift in space exsplraion along with giving us a lot more insite into Venus's history. If Venus was to be exsplored by us than we would be given a tremondous amount of knowledge of the planet and of better space exsploration.  NASA and scinentists have been trying to find a way to get to Venus and stay on Venus. They have propossed a few awnsers: one is that they create a station that would stay above the clouds. The air pressure and acid leavels are not as bad above the clouds and the tempeture is lower as well. The only problem is that we wouldn't be able to get much knowledge from above the clouds because the clouds are so thick we wouldn't be able to see past them. Another awner to the problem is to use older tech. Stated in paragrapgh seven: "Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tent to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions." This means that new tech is less durable however older tech, which may not be as stylish, is incredibly durable, and could be the key to finally keeping a shuttle on Venus.  As the author suggests, studying Venus would help humanity tremondously despite the dangerous it presents; even though the planet is incredibly dangerous we would still benfit in learning about our sister planet.		0
Within the past decade, humans have watched in awe as technology has improved exponentially, and learned to take on tasks once thought only humans could accomplish. Technology has been taught to communicate, entertain, solve problems, along with many other functions, and now it may be able to teach as well. Though we have made use of every technological advancement in the past, this may be one that we should not capitalize on. Before taking this enourmous step in technological advancement, humans must consider the flaws within this newly developed system, and whether we are ready to replace teachers with computers.  Though this new system is an astonishing feat in technology, people muct recognize the flaws within this system as well. As described in paragraph 6, a students facial expression has the power to change a lesson. If this is true, could a student not simply fake an emotion to get out of assignments or slack off by acting confused. The article claims that the software can pick up on fake smiles, but can it detect false expressions for other emotions as well? Another flaw within this system is the emotions the technology is capable of percieving, paragraph 6 disscusses the modification of a lesson based on boredom or confusion detected by the computer, however, neither of these two feelings are listed in the 6 emotions that the software is capable of detecting (paragraph 3). These two major flaws within the software lead to only one conclusion, the technology is simply not advanced enough to take on the role of a teacher.  Humans must also consider this issue from an ethical standpoint, are we ready to take away the role of teachers and replace them with software? Though machines have already taken away menial jobs, such as factory work, teaching is a career which requires a four year college degree and a license. Countless people aspire to become teachers, are we ready to take that away? Even if teachers were to work hand in hand with this technology there would still be flaws. Having a computer read the emotions of a student rather than a teacher would sever immportant student teacher ties, and cheat that student of the oppurtunity of a mentor relasionship. Because people are already capable of reading emotions, it would be foolish to replace that for a less precise piece of equipment. Because of the immportant role of teachers in the lives of students, the push for emotion detecting software in the classroom should be stopped.  Because of the major systematic flaws, and the ethical dilemas accompaniing this issue, it is clear that at least for the time being, the efforts to integrate emotion detecting software into the the cassroom should be put on hold. Though this is an astonishing advancement in technology, there is much to consider before pursuing this movement.		0
Dear Principal Johnson,   I am writing to share my thoughts on whether community service should be required for all students. While I understand that some students prefer to spend their free time on other activities, I believe requiring community service is extremely beneficial and an important part of every student's education.   There are several reasons why community service should be mandatory. First, it teaches students the value of giving back to their community. So many of our peers donate their time to help others by tutoring younger students, assisting at food banks or shelters, cleaning up parks and beaches, and more. Through these experiences, students learn citizenship and caring for those around them. They see firsthand how their small efforts can make a big difference.  Second, community service exposes students to diverse populations and social issues they may not otherwise encounter. By interacting with people of various backgrounds and needs, students gain a greater understanding and appreciation for their community in its entirety. Whether helping in an after-school program or assisting the elderly, community service opens eyes to the challenges some residents face on a daily basis.   Finally, participation in community service looks great on college applications and resumes. With competition for spots at top schools and jobs increasingly intense, experiences like volunteer work set students apart and demonstrate leadership, work ethic, compassion, and other qualities valued by admissions officers and future employers. For many students, community service hours are their first chance to build a record of civic participation.   In conclusion, while free time is important, requiring community service hours would educate students about citizenship, expose them to the real issues facing our community, and better prepare them for their futures. The small sacrifice of personal time is greatly outweighed by the lifelong benefits of giving back. For these reasons, I believe community service should be mandatory for all students.  Thank you for your consideration. Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Sincerely, [Your name]		1
Preliminary research suggests that the introduction of a four-day work week could bring numerous benefits to businesses and schools. From an environmental standpoint, ditching a traditional five-day work week could reduce carbon emissions, as commuting and using electricity would be reduced. In terms of educational impact, research indicates that school districts that have adopted a shorter school week are seeing improved student performance and attendance. On the economic side, a four-day week can reduce costs associated with utilities, payroll, and supplies. In addition, it can increase employee morale and productivity and reduce employee stress levels. Some businesses and schools throughout the world have already implemented the four-day work week and are currently reaping its benefits. For example, a school in Utah switched to a four-day week and reported improved test scores, as well as greater staff satisfaction and engagement. Similarly, a business in Finland switched to a four-day week and reported average gains in employee productivity between 9-15 percent. Overall, a four-day work week holds significant potential for both businesses and schools in terms of economics, the environment, and performance.		1
The legalization of marijuana has been a topic of debate in recent years. Some people believe that it should be legalized, while others think otherwise. In my opinion, marijuana should not be legalized because it can have a negative impact on people's health and can also lead to addiction.  Firstly, marijuana use can have harmful effects on a person's health. Smoking marijuana can damage the lungs and cause breathing problems. It can also affect a person's memory, making it difficult for them to remember things. Additionally, marijuana use can impair a person's ability to think and make decisions, which can be dangerous if they are driving or operating heavy machinery.  Secondly, legalizing marijuana can lead to addiction. Just like alcohol and tobacco, marijuana is a drug that can be addictive. People who use marijuana regularly may become dependent on it and find it difficult to quit. This can lead to a range of problems, including financial difficulties and relationship problems.  Furthermore, legalizing marijuana can send the wrong message to young people. If marijuana is legalized, it may give the impression that it is safe to use. This can encourage young people to try it, which can be dangerous as their brains are still developing.  In conclusion, I believe that marijuana should not be legalized because of its negative impact on health, the risk of addiction, and the potential harm to young people. Instead, we should focus on educating people about the dangers of drug use and providing support for those who are struggling with addiction.		1
Car usage has become a major issue in today's society. Many people are concerned about the environmental impact of cars, as well as the health risks associated with driving. There are many ways to limit car usage, and there are many benefits to doing so.  One way to limit car usage is to walk or bike instead of driving. This is a great way to get exercise and fresh air. It is also a great way to save money on gas and parking. Walking or biking is also a great way to reduce your carbon footprint.  Another way to limit car usage is to take public transportation. This is a great way to save money on gas and parking. It is also a great way to reduce your carbon footprint. Public transportation is also a great way to meet new people and learn about your community.  Finally, you can also limit car usage by carpooling or taking a ride-sharing service. This is a great way to save money on gas and parking. It is also a great way to reduce your carbon footprint. Carpooling or taking a ride-sharing service is also a great way to meet new people and learn about your community.  Limiting car usage has many benefits. It is good for the environment, and it is good for your health. It is also good for your wallet. There are many ways to limit car usage, and there is a way for everyone to do it.  Here are some additional information about the advantages of limiting car usage:  * **Environmental benefits:** Cars are a major source of air pollution. They emit carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and other pollutants that can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Limiting car usage can help to improve air quality and reduce the risk of these health problems. * **Health benefits:** Walking and biking are great forms of exercise. They can help to reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, stroke, and other chronic diseases. Limiting car usage can help to increase physical activity levels and improve public health. * **Financial benefits:** Cars are expensive to own and operate. The cost of gas, insurance, and parking can add up quickly. Limiting car usage can help to save money on transportation costs. * **Community benefits:** When people walk, bike, or take public transportation, they are more likely to interact with their neighbors and get to know their community. This can help to build a stronger sense of community and reduce crime.  Overall, there are many advantages to limiting car usage. It is good for the environment, it is good for your health, it is good for your wallet, and it is good for your community. If you are looking for ways to reduce your impact on the environment and improve your health, consider limiting car usage. You may be surprised at how easy it is to do, and how many benefits you will enjoy.		1
 Venus, also known as the Earth  s sister planet due to its similarities in size and composition, has long been a subject of exploration and interest for scientists and astronomers alike. This second planet from the sun is a shrouded mystery, with a thick atmosphere that traps heat and makes it extremely difficult to study its surface directly. However, recent advances in technology and exploration methods have provided new insights into the planet  s structure, geology, and potential for habitability.  One of the main challenges in exploring Venus is its hostile environment. The planet  s surface temperature can reach up to 460 degrees Celsius, and its atmosphere is composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with extremely high levels of sulfuric acid that make it inhospitable to humans and most other life forms. Additionally, the planet  s intense greenhouse effect means that it is completely covered in thick clouds that make it impossible to see the surface beneath.   However, despite these challenges, scientists have managed to gather valuable information about Venus through a variety of remote sensing techniques. One such technique is radar imaging, which has allowed scientists to create detailed maps of the planet  s surface and study its geology in greater depth. Radar imaging works by sending radio waves to the planet  s surface and measuring the time it takes for them to bounce back, allowing scientists to determine the distance, topography, and composition of the surface.   Another important technique for studying Venus is spectroscopy, which involves analyzing the light reflecting off the planet  s surface. By studying the different wavelengths of light and the gases they contain, scientists can determine the composition of the atmosphere and the planet  s surface. This information can then be used to better understand the planet  s geology, climate, and potential for habitability.   Recent missions to Venus, such as the Magellan spacecraft, have also provided valuable insights into the planet  s structure and composition. The Magellan spacecraft, which orbits the planet, has been equipped with a radar instrument that has allowed scientists to create a detailed map of the planet  s surface. This map, which covers over 25% of the planet  s surface, has revealed features such as mountains, valleys, and large impact craters.   In conclusion, exploring Venus presents many challenges, but recent advances in technology and exploration methods have allowed scientists to gain a better understanding of this mysterious planet. By using techniques such as radar imaging, spectroscopy, and remote sensing, scientists have been able to create detailed maps of the planet  s surface, study its geology, and analyze its composition. While much remains unknown about Venus, these advances have provided valuable insights into the planet  s potential for habitability and its place in our solar system. As our understanding of Venus continues to grow, we may one day unlock its secrets and explore its surface in person.		1
Joining the Seagoing Cowboys progam can benefit recovering countries and yourself. If you enjoy helping people in need and traveling the world then you'll want to sign up for this progam. Some reasons why you should the program ar being aware of other countries and their needs,experiencing several countries' history and culture, and helping ruined countries.  In paragraph two, the passage explains that many countries were left in ruins after World War two. It states,"To help countries recover their food suppliers, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA(the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.  In paragraph nine it said that it opened up the world to me. I stated "It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. It stated that the awareness stayed with me and it lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. In paragraph five, I stated," The cattle-boat trips were an unbelieveale oppurtunity for a small-town boy," I also said,"Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special." In the passage I said ."So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, acity with streets of water." I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canalo on my way back to China. I had the privilage of traveling around the world and experiencing different cultures and several coutries' history.  In conclusion, I believe that you and many ruined countries will benefit from this progam. It is something that you will always remember and will stick with you throughout you're life. You will also benefit from it greatly for many reasons that I have already stated before hand.           		0
There are so many things that humans have not explored despite how close we are to them. Venus is the the closest planet to Earth but we stiill haven´t explored it in over three decades. Even though these missions to Venus are dangerous, we still need to explore what we can. In ¨The Challenge of Exploring Venus,¨ the author states that studying Venus is a worthly persuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports this idea by describing how Venus might have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.  The author supports that Venus is worth exploring despite the dangers because it might have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In paragraph 4, the author describes how important it is that we explore Venus, and how similar Earth is to this planet. ¨Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth" (4). This quote explains how similar Earth was to Venus and also describes the need for discovery. Venus is worthy to be explored despite the dangers because we need to see why Venus is no longer like Earth and why it doesn´t have forms of life on it anymore. Going to Venus would be a worthy persuit because we are very limited to the planets that we can explore and Venus is one of the only planets to visit right now with our current technology. This evidence proves the author suggesting how important it is to go on an exploration to Venus because it used to be similar to Earth, but it has vastly changed and we need to see how and why.  In conclusion, the author supports the idea thoroughly that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by describing how Venus might have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. The fact that Venus and Earth used to be so similar is important because scientists need to discover why Venus is so different and how this happened. Going through with this exploration would be extremely benificial and would open up new ideas on how we can save our planet today. 		0
**Introduction**  Have you heard of the Face on Mars? It's a big, mysterious rock formation that looks like a human face. Some people think it was created by aliens, but scientists say it's just a natural landform.   In this essay, I'm going to use evidence from the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" to argue that the Face is a natural formation. I'll start by discussing the history of the Face, then I'll talk about the evidence that suggests it's not artificial. Finally, I'll give my conclusion.  **Body**  The Face on Mars was first discovered in 1976 by the Viking 1 spacecraft. Scientists were immediately intrigued by the formation, and some people even suggested that it was a deliberate construction. However, more careful study of the Face has led scientists to believe that it's just a natural landform.  One of the most important pieces of evidence against the artificiality of the Face is its location. The Face is located on the side of a large, flat mesa. This mesa is made of sedimentary rock, which is formed by the deposition of sediment over time. The Face itself is made of a different type of rock, called basalt. Basalt is a volcanic rock, which is formed when lava cools and solidifies.  The fact that the Face is made of a different type of rock than the mesa suggests that it was not created by intelligent beings. If the Face was artificial, it would have been made of the same type of rock as the mesa. The fact that it's not suggests that it's a natural formation.  Another piece of evidence against the artificiality of the Face is its size. The Face is about 1.6 kilometers wide and 1.2 kilometers tall. This is a very large formation, and it would have been difficult for an intelligent civilization to create. If the Face was artificial, it would have been much smaller.  The Face on Mars is a fascinating and mysterious formation, but there's no evidence to suggest that it was created by aliens. The most likely explanation is that it's a natural landform.  **Conclusion**  In conclusion, I believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. The evidence suggests that it's not artificial, and there's no reason to believe that it was created by aliens. The Face is a beautiful and unique formation, and it's a reminder of the amazing things that nature can create.		1
In the "Making Mona Lisa Smile" article, the author introduces the new technology Facial Action Coding System. The article states that this system allows computers to identify human emotions. The six basic emotions include: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. In my opinion, i think this use of technology would be extremely valuable for reading students emotions inside a classroom.  This technology can detect emotions of people that not everyone will be able to point out on someone. In paragraph five lines 6-8, the author states that Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. Dr. Huang has a similar software that has similar values. If this software was used in a classroom, it would be able to detect precise emotions of students, whether they are confused or understanding something.  In many schools, students often use computers. In paragraph six, it goes into detail of what it would be like for this system to be put into use. If the Facial Action Coding System were to be put on students computers, it would be able to help get a better understanding of were the students are at. For example, if this system shows that the student is bored, this can tell the teacher that they need to make the assignment more hands on or active. Another example would be in the student is conveying the emotion of confusion. This can show the teacher that this particular student needs more help and a better understanding of the topic. If the student is showing the emotion suprised, it could show the teacher that the student learned something new or is interested in the topic.  In paragraph eight, it describes what a false smile looks like. The article states that in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and the muscle risorius. Later on in the article, it says how these movements are able to detect whether someone is being honest or not. In a school or classroom, this can help take on more of a disobedience act then being able to detect if someone is confused or not. If a student is not in the right state of mind, whether that be depression, anger, etc., this new technology can help the school figure out a way to reach out to the student and recieve them help or guidance.  The article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" goes into depth of ways the new technology, Facial Action Coding System, can be valuable in detecting human emotions. At the beginning of the article, the author starts off by giving an example of this technology being used on the Mona Lisa painting. The author gives the percentages with each of her emotions she is conveying in her portrait. The author then states this technology is able to detect the six basic emotions: happines, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. By putting this into classrooms, this can help the teachers, administraters, principles, etc., get a better undertsanding of their students and the environemt they work in on a day to day basis.		0
The Promises and Perils of Driverless Cars  More and more experts predict that fully autonomous vehicles will become common on our roadways in the near future. However, the development of driverless cars presents society with difficult challenges and tradeoffs that require careful consideration.   There are compelling reasons to support research into driverless car technology. As the article discusses, these vehicles could significantly reduce accidents caused by human error, removing fallible human judgment from the driving task. Every year, over 1 million people die worldwide due to traffic accidents. If automated driving systems live up to their potential, they may make travel far safer by removing the mortal vulnerability of human pilots behind the wheel. Proponents also argue that driverless cars could prove a boon for elderly or disabled individuals by expanding their mobility. With an autonomous vehicle to chauffeur them, many who could no longer drive themselves may regain independence.   However, the article also raises reasonable concerns about the risks of a fully automated driving future. While human error now accounts for over 90% of accidents, machines are not infallible either and their faults may manifest in unpredictable ways. Unforeseen software or hardware failures could potentially result in collisions that baffle even engineers. Additionally, some critics fear that widespread reliance on autonomous technology may lead to a decline in active driving skills over time, leaving people unprepared in the event of software malfunctions or the need to manually drive in an emergency. There are also open legal questions around assigning liability in accidents involving autonomous vehicles.  On balance, while driverless cars promise compelling benefits of safety and mobility, the challenges of ensuring their dependability and the societal transition are not to be underestimated. More research is still needed to evaluate risks and allay reasonable doubts before this technology is deployed without human supervision on a large scale. A cautious, phased approach seems wisest to maximize benefits and avoid unintended consequences as such a disruptive transportation innovation is incorporated into our lives. Given both the promises and perils, further progress developing autonomous vehicles requires continued prudent oversight to navigate both this transition and the road ahead responsibly.		1
The driverless car seems like it would be a really cool invention, but seems like it could have some issues. The car would be moving somewhat out of your control especially if used as a public transportation vehicle. This would make the older generations worry about their kids and grandkids since they realize it could break down anytime anywhere.  The vehicle could easily be labled as dangerous since the text states, "Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash" 500,000 miles is good but you have to be under certain conditions. How good would the car work if you can't or live to far away to drive under these special conditions? The car might malfunction or go crazy, it could just simply blow up. Due to these statements this car could be labled dangerous.  The car could also be labled dangerous for its inability to pull in and out of driveways. This could be a hazard for the young kids who are just learning how to drive and think the car can do everything for them like Google makes it look like it can. Backing out of a driveway can be a very dangerous action to accomplish because if there are obstacles blocking the view of the road you can not see cars going past you.  The car can also be a dangerous vehicle because if you are driving and get drowsy or something with nobody else in the car with you, you could run right through a construction site. This is obviously a big concern for a lot of people because a construction site can have many hazardous tools that could kill you instantly even with protection of a car. Its a dangerous car for you and also the people around yo. If someone else on the road wasn't in an automatic driverless car and made a mistake you wouldnt have the chance to dodge the other driver to save yourself you guys would both just crash.  Driverless cars can be very helpful, but overall i see them as death traps. They could take peoples lives over a simple mistake like a malfunction. I would not drive a driverless car or allow my kids to drive one due to safety concerns and lack of control. Afterall those movies with driverless cars often end bad any way.		0
 Should students begin looking for careers before entering high school? This is a question that has been debated for years, with some people arguing that it is important to have a clear idea of what you want to do in the future, while others believe that it is more important to focus on personal growth and exploration during high school. In my opinion, both approaches have their merits, but ultimately, it is important for students to find a balance that works for them.  On one hand, having a clear idea of what you want to do in the future can be incredibly helpful. By knowing what you want to pursue, you can take classes in high school that will help you get there. For example, if you are interested in becoming a doctor, you can take science classes and participate in extracurricular activities that will give you the skills and experience you need to succeed. This can give you a head start on your career and help you stand out when it comes time to apply to college or graduate school.  On the other hand, it is also important for students to focus on personal growth and exploration during high school. This is a time when you are discovering who you are and what you are passionate about. It is a good idea to try new things and explore different interests, even if you are not sure if you want to pursue them in the future. This can help you develop new skills, make new friends, and gain a better understanding of yourself.  Ultimately, the most important thing is for students to find a balance that works for them. If you know what you want to do in the future, it can be helpful to start working towards that goal during high school. However, it is also important to remember that personal growth and exploration are just as important. By finding a balance between the two, you can set yourself up for success in the future while also enjoying the present.		1
In the United states, it important to attend school whenever possible. After all, missing a single day could cause a snowball effect to start and one could fall behind easily. Some schools have started offering distance learning to allow students to attend class from home via video conference. This ingenious idea could potentially drastically reduce the negative effects of absences. It greatly benefits those who are sick for long periods of time or hospitalized, grants a level of accountability that discourages skipping school, and facilitates a faster class pacing through a reduction of wasteful review time.  Most, if not all people have experienced being sick at one point or another. There's many ways to get sick and many ways your body protects itself. When one gets the stomach flu, they should take a day to get better before returning to school, but for those who are chronically ill or hospitalized, this might not be an option. With distance learning as an option, those who are bedridden or otherwise physically incapable of getting to school for an extended period could continue to further their education and not have to worry about making up assignments when they get back. With the current system in place for homework and school projects, it's exceptionally easy to have a few days of medical leave turn into a huge headache for the sick individual, but with distance learning, a diligent student could maintain their grades and sanity even if they are incapable of being at school in person.  Keeping in mind that not everyone might have a positive attitude about school, it is important to note the accountability that comes with a distance learning option. Students would be less inclined to miss school on purpose because they would still be accountable for being in class over video. Without a doctors note or an email from a parent, it would be incredibly difficult for someone to get away with skipping class both physically and digitally without getting caught in their lie. Through this clever trick, schools would be able to crack down on the students who regularly skip school for various reasons. In this way, distance learning benefits students with an attitude problem almost as much as it benefits those with health issues.  Additionally, the distance learning system benefits teachers. With students in class physically or digitally an overwhelming majority of the time, teachers would not need to recap their last lesson as often because the students were there and don't need as much of a refresher. This would allow teachers greater flexibility in their teaching schedules, letting them breeze through the topics that students find easy in order to linger longer on more challenging material. Not only does this freedom give teachers the ability to get through material faster, but it also allows them to teach more effectively and efficiently.  One might argue that distance learning could enable cheating, but there are ways to implement it in a way that significantly reduce the chances that it's taken advantage of. For example, attending a class via video conference could count as being tardy instead of an absence or attendance, which would allow use of the system, but discourage reliance on it. Students would still need their assignments turned in physically, and would not be able to test using the call.  In conclusion, the benefits of a distance learning system far outweigh any possible negative side-effects. Such an option would encourage each student to give their education top priority. Allowing students to attend class even when sick or physically impaired would invite them to show their true colors and would allow those who push themselves to continue to achieve their goals and aspirations. Distance learning should be an option offered by every school, to promote a bright future for every student.		0
Dear Mr. Principal,  My name is STUDENT_NAME and I have been thinking about what your trying to do about students being required to do community service. In my opinion I say that yes students should be required to do community service because doing good for our planet is good for us and it could be fun. Community service is not only about picking up trash is also about helping ourselves if there was no community services then by know we will be living in a pile of trash, but we are lucky of having it and we need more people to join.  Another reason why students should do community service is because it could also help us with our personality and our life. This could change someone's life because what about if a student does drugs and is a bully and then is required to join community service and ends up liking it. This student changes to a person that is know very caring and gave up drugs because he feels good about himself. I think im going to join community service.  Sincerely,  STUDENT_NAME		0
The use of technology to read emotions in the classroom is not valuable because it would not work as efficatly as planned, it would give false info, and it would waste time and money.  The use of technology in the classroom would not work as planned because some sutdents would not want to do it. They would not want other people to know what there emotions where all the time. It could maybe even make some students uncomfortable. So the use for all students may just not fit.  Another reason it would not work is because it would give back false information. If one student had a bad day it might say that he dosen't like that class. It could say that he dosent pay attintion in class at all, but one bad day dosent make a kid a bad student. We all have bad days.  The last reason that the use of emotional recognition tech. would not be valuable in the classroom is that it would waste time and money. It would time because it would take extra time for it to read everyone's faces fast enough that it would give accuate results. It would waste money because the device that would read students face would probley cost a fortion. Then the people who et the results may try and charge you for the information.  Thats why i think that the use of technology to read emotions would be a waste of time and money, not be vary effective, and give false information.		0
  Dear State Senator,  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I believe it is still a crucial part of our democratic process.  One of the main arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a candidate must receive broad support across the country, rather than just relying on a popular vote in a few heavily populated areas. As Bradford Plumer notes in his article "The Indefensible Electoral College," the winner-take-all system used in most states means that candidates often focus their efforts on swing states, ignoring the needs and concerns of voters in other areas (Plumer). By requiring candidates to win a majority of electoral votes, the Electoral College encourages them to campaign in a wider range of states and listen to the concerns of a more diverse group of voters.  Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it provides a mechanism for dealing with the possibility of a tie in the electoral vote. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out in his article "In Defense of the Electoral College," it is highly unlikely that the winner of the popular vote will also win the electoral vote, but it is possible that the two could be separated by a small margin (Posner). In such a scenario, the House of Representatives would decide the election, ensuring that the President is chosen by a broad consensus of the American people.  Critics of the Electoral College argue that it is undemocratic and unfair, as it can lead to situations where a candidate wins the presidency without receiving the most popular votes. However, as Posner notes, this is a rare occurrence, and the Electoral College has ensured that the President has a broad		1
Sure, I'll give it a try! Here's my essay:  Hey, Mrs. Smith! Here's my essay on whether people choose their own character traits or not. I think it's pretty cool that we get to choose our own personality, but I also think there are some things that are beyond our control.  First of all, let's talk about kindness. I think most people would agree that being kind is a good thing. It's like, you know, being nice to others and stuff. But I think some people might say that they're just naturally kind, like it's just part of who they are. Like, my best friend Emily is always being kind to everyone, even when they're being mean to her. She just doesn't let it get to her. That's pretty cool, right? But I don't think I could ever be that kind, even if I wanted to. I get mad when people are mean to me, so I don't think I could just ignore it.  Next up, let's talk about rudeness. Ugh, I hate when people are rude. It's just so annoying when they don't listen to you or don't do what you ask them to do. But I think some people might say that they're just naturally rude, like it's just part of who they are. Like, my brother is always being rude to my mom, even though she's always trying to be nice to him. It's like, he just doesn't care. But I think I could be more considerate if I wanted to be. I mean, I don't always listen to my mom, but I try to be nice to her most of the time.  Lastly, let's talk about helpfulness. I think it's really cool when people are helpful. It's like, they go out of their way to help others, even if it's not easy for them. Like, my neighbor Mrs. Johnson is always helping me with my homework when I need it. She's really nice and stuff. But I don't think I could ever be that helpful, even if I wanted to. I get distracted easily and I don't always pay attention to what'		1
Success is a term that is often associated with people who have achieved great things in their lives. Whether it's in business, sports, art, or any other field, successful people have a unique set of traits and experiences that have led them to where they are today. In this essay, I will explore what it takes to be successful, emphasizing the importance of believing in oneself and receiving support from family. I will also discuss an example of a successful person who fought for and achieved their goals, and present the idea that failure is part of the success path and is not an indication to give up.  First and foremost, believing in oneself is crucial to achieving success. It is easy to get discouraged and doubt oneself, especially when faced with challenges and obstacles. However, it is important to remember that everyone has the potential to succeed, and it is up to us to believe in ourselves and our abilities. This means setting goals, working hard, and never giving up, even when things get tough. It also means surrounding ourselves with positive influences and people who believe in us, as this can provide the motivation and support we need to keep going.  Another important factor in achieving success is receiving support from family. Family is often the first line of defense when things get tough, and they can provide emotional and practical support that can help us overcome obstacles. This can be in the form of encouragement, financial assistance, or simply being there to listen and offer advice. It is important to remember that family is not just a source of support, but also a source of love and unconditional acceptance, which can provide the foundation for success.  One example of a successful person who fought for and achieved their goals is Oprah Winfrey. Oprah was born into poverty and faced numerous challenges in her life, including abuse and discrimination. However, she never gave up and instead used these experiences to fuel her passion for success. She worked hard, studied, and eventually became a successful talk show host and media mogul. Her story is a testament to the power of perseverance and the importance of believing in oneself, even in the face of adversity.  Finally, it is important to remember that failure is a natural part of the success path. It is easy to get discouraged when we fail, but it is important to remember that failure is simply an opportunity to learn and grow. We can		1
Home schooling and attending a traditional school are two different approaches to education that parents can choose from for their children. Each approach has its own set of benefits that make it more suitable for certain families and students. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of home schooling versus attending a traditional school.  Home schooling is an educational option that allows parents to take on the role of their child's teacher. This approach offers a more personalized and individualized education, as the parent can tailor the curriculum to their child's learning style and interests. Home schooling also allows for a more flexible schedule, as parents can set their own pace and schedule for their child's education. This flexibility can be especially beneficial for families with busy schedules or children who have special needs.  One of the main benefits of home schooling is the ability to provide a safe and nurturing learning environment for the child. In a traditional school setting, students are exposed to a variety of negative influences, such as bullying, peer pressure, and drugs. Home schooling allows parents to create a safe and supportive environment where their child can learn and grow without these distractions.  Attending a traditional school, on the other hand, offers a more structured and organized educational experience. Traditional schools provide a standardized curriculum that is designed to prepare students for college and the workforce. This curriculum is often based on state and national standards, and provides students with a broad range of subjects that they need to succeed in the future.  One of the main benefits of attending a traditional school is the opportunity to socialize with peers and develop important social skills. In a traditional school setting, students are exposed to a diverse group of people, which can help them develop empathy and understanding for others. Additionally, attending a traditional school provides students with the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities and sports, which can help them develop important teamwork and leadership skills.  In conclusion, both home schooling and attending a traditional school have their own set of benefits that make them suitable for certain families and students. Home schooling offers a more personalized and flexible education, while attending a traditional school provides a more structured and organized educational experience. Ultimately, the decision between home schooling and attending a traditional school will depend on the individual needs and circumstances of each family and student.		1
Standardized testing is a hot topic in the education world. While some people believe that these tests are an accurate measure of student ability, others argue that they are not. In my opinion, standardized tests do not accurately measure a student's ability. There are several reasons why I believe this to be true.  Firstly, standardized tests only measure a student's ability to take a test. They do not take into account other important factors that can impact a student's performance, such as their home life, their mental health, or their learning style. For example, a student who struggles with anxiety may perform poorly on a standardized test, even if they are very intelligent and capable of doing well in school.  Secondly, standardized tests often focus on a narrow range of skills and knowledge. They do not provide a comprehensive picture of what a student knows and can do. For example, a student who is very talented in the arts may not perform well on a standardized math test, even if they are very good at math.  Finally, standardized tests can be biased against certain groups of students. For example, students who come from low-income families or who speak English as a second language may struggle with standardized tests because they are not familiar with the language or the cultural references that are used in the tests.  In conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. They only measure a student's ability to take a test, they focus on a narrow range of skills and knowledge, and they can be biased against certain groups of students. Instead of relying on standardized tests, we should focus on other ways of assessing student learning, such as project-based assessments, portfolios, and teacher observations. These methods provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of what a student knows and can do.		1
Distance learning is defined as online classes or video conferencing. In other words, it's homeschooling. Students who are enrolled in distance learning usually end up in that position due to life factors such as bullying, disabilities, or mental illness. The discussion of whether this is beneficial or detrimental to students is a gray area, with both sides making reasonable arguments. However, I personally am against distance learning. Homeschooling offers a controlled environment with little disruption, but it hinders a child's social skills. Although learning in ones household gives students more freedom in the day to move around when they want, they also have the freedom to ignore their responsibilities and not do the work. A student's concentration levels can increase, but staring at a screen for long periods of time can cause irritation to the eyes. There's nothing wrong with the idea of taking lessons outside of school, but to be aware of the issues with learning from home is necessary.  For starters, distance learning contributes very little to the social skills of a student. Imagine pulling a child out of school, away from their friends and favorite teachers, and plopping them down in an empty room with nothing but a computer and some scratch paper and telling them, "This is how you're going to take lessons from now on". Although this can be resourceful to students on the autism spectrum or other health problems, keeping them stuck inside a house all alone may do more harm than good. For example, an old friend of mine from Generic_City is home schooled. While they didn't mind it, they would oftentimes gripe about how unbearably lonely and depressed they were; they couldn't go anywhere, there was nothing to do and there was nobody they knew in real life to talk to. Students will be unable to engage in opportunities to interact with people around their age, nor can they participate in any events or extracurricular activities. As a result, they could grow up socially awkward or verbally impulsive, negatively affecting their chance at proper growth.  Secondly, the concept of students working at home can be difficult to manage. When a teenager takes online classes or video conferencing, nobody is making sure they're doing their assignments. Young people are lazy by nature; when a teacher or adult leaves the room, we lose focus and chat among each other. In a controlled environment this wouldn't be a problem, but with nobody supervising the student, it makes it easier for them to neglect their classwork and do whatever they want. When I took homeschooling for a mere three days, I did very little of my homework; I found the task boring and pointless, and eventually I returned to public school. Additionally, online classroom assignments are more time consuming and challenging than what public school has to offer. This only further discourages the student from applying any amount of effort into their classwork, especially if they cannot understand the subject.  Finally, the reason why distance learning is not as effective as in-school learning is due to how homebound students are taught. In today's age we learn with the help of technology, using sideshows and laptops to simplify lessons for the young. Students in public school, while relying on electronics for information, don't get as much screen time as home schooled kids do; taking online classes requires a computer. If a home schooled student spends this much time scrolling and clicking through each and every lesson, that would mean the average screen time they receive is twice more than what publicly schooled students are exposed to. As harmless as it may sound, staring at a bright white screen can cause irritation to the eyes, causing tension headaches or nearsightedness; it can wear out your back or increase the likelihood of suffering from depression or anxiety. I used to have an addiction to my electronic devices. As a result, I was cranky and miserable, and my eyes and back were sore from sitting hunched over my phone. If a student benefits from learning through a computer, there is nothing wrong with that. That doesn't mean, however, every home schooled child can afford to stare at a screen for hours a day without feeling physically or mentally drained.  We all want the best for our youth, but doing that requires the process of making difficult choices. Distance learning provides an opportunity for students, yet doing so may hurt their behaviors in secretive ways. Students--specifically those with mental disabilities--can thrive in a learning environment without the fear of being bullied, but it can prevent them from meeting new people in both the classroom and in an after-school activity. Homeschooling has a more controlled, less disruptive environment, yet with no teacher present it can give way to laziness. Technology makes learning easier, but for students who have to learn electronically everyday, their physical and mental health are at risk of harm. The solution to this would be to eventually enroll a child into public schooling once they're at an appropriate age; distance learning is effective to others depending on their character, but as they grow up, it's better for them to develop and flourish alongside students in their grade rather than by themselves.		0
Its that time of year where students have to complete a summer project. These projects are a way of making sure that the students are learning and being productive throughout their summer vacation. Students best know their own interests, so, summer projects should be student-designed because it ensures that students will be engaged, leads to completion of the project, and promotes the continuation of their interests.  Although, some people may think that student-designed summer projects are not the best way to have students continue their education. For the reasons of it leads to researching non-important topics or results in students not taking the project seriously. This point of view makes sense because if the projects are teacher-designed it would ensure that all students are learning about something important and valuable to their education. However, this point of view is wrong because the definition of an important topic is different to everyone. Students will do the summer project on something of importance or value to them because they have the option to make it something or their own and make it unique.  Students will always become engaged in a topic if the have the freedom to choose it. While students are getting ready to choose what they want to do during the summer they will become interested about the topic they choose. This will make sure that students are kept interested throughout the summer to produce something that they are proud of. For example, a students favorite animal is a panda and he or she wants to research, visit museums, visit libraries, and visit the zoo to learn more about them and be able to come up with a good project. This student is eager to learn about something he or she loves and is passionate about. This project will keep this student fully engaged through the summer learning about the panda. All students have something that they are interested in and if they choose a topic and create a project it may even open and door to a passion they were not aware of.  In addition, the completion of the student-designed summer project is critical to their learning because without the completion of it students will not get the full experience of learning what they picked on their project. If students are allowed to design their own projects the teachers will not have to worry about a students not completing the project because they became uninterested or bored. Students will be eager to complete their projects and that is all a teacher could want is to have a student eager about a project and then complete it because they wanted to not because they were forced to. For example a student is given the topic of rocks and the student has never had an interest in this. The student will struggle because they have no interest in researching rocks. This student will most likely not complete the project or will do it in the last week of summer. This prevents students of having a valuable learning experience with something that they like.  As well as students having a variety of interests, if the summer projects are student-designed they could explore an area of interest that they are already familiar with and dive in deep to what they like. This could help a student find out more information on a topic they think they may like or already know that they have a passion for. For example, if a student is interested in medicine and they want to become a doctor why would they need to research rocks? This student will have the time to research what she wants to do with her future while also completing her schools requirement. It is a great thing for a young student to already be setting their mind into what they will like to do in their future and researching it.  Summer learning projects should be student-designed because it help ensure that students will be engaged, leads to project completion, and allows for the continuation of personal interests. Students need to have a time to be able to research and make a project on a topic that they enjoy learning about and what better time than the summer to do that. Young students are the future, so, the schools should permit student-designed summer projects to have the students better understand the topic of their choice. The next time students have to do summer project they should be allowed to design it and stride for their best educational experience.         		0
Do you want to be a cowboy?  Have you ever heard of a Seagoing Cowboy? Well, a Seagoing Cowboys is the best kind of cowboy there is. When you're a Seagoing Cowboy you take care of horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped to places in the world that were left in ruins from World War ll. The cool part is that you get to go across seas and you also have time to go sightseeing. But it feels great to help people as well.  If you become a Seagoing Cowboy you have great responsibility. Yess it sounds like a fun getaway, but you also have to fed and water the animals at least two times a day. We also get to clean all those messy stalls, but you learn to be responsible which is important.  After you get to your destination you can go sightseeing. I got to see Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water by the way. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.  On return trips after the animals have been unloaded is when you have fun on boared. The cowboys play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals have been. Table-tennis touraments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also help pass the time.  So if you want to be a cowboy you should be a Seagoing Cowboy. Not only do you learn about how to be responsible you also get to see the world and have fun with your other fellow cowboys. Most importantly, you help people which makes you feel good!    		0
Dear, We dont need another voting crisis over the small states, the representatives voting how they want to vote to suit their needs. Our voting system needs to be perfected, so we dont have any more tie elections of complications. The Electoral College system is very easy to get unbalanced and played around with to get the outcome that they so desire. As a country we should abolish the Electoral College system and vote baised of off popular vote.  When the whole country votes for the president, in reality we are really voting for a group of electors to do this job for us. In article 2" Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president." This is saying that the people really dont directly vote for the president and in that time anything can happen to the voting data. Another clame to help that point is article 2 "conciter that state legislature are technically responsible for picking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people." The excerpt from article 2 is saying again that anything can happen to the data and it can be easily tampered with. In article 3 " its the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a stats of electors." Again this still says that we are not directly voting and the people want that.  The "winner takes all" voting method is not really effective because if a little less than half of claforna votes democrat and a little more than half vote republican, should all 55 votes go to the republican candidate or should that percent go to the candidate? In article 1 "Most states have a "winnertake all" system that awards all electors to the wining presidential candidate." This system is qutie unjustice and not equal to the rest of the states expesilly for the "swing" states.  This system of electorial college is not the most balenced of the systems that our nation can come up with. In article 2 " The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe." This so called "amazing" system has manny defaults and those defaults will cause huge problems tor the rest of the nation. In article 3 " A tie in the nation wide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number." So ties in the national voting for the president can have a tie and is not that efficent in the way that we find who wins.  There are some bright sides to this style of voting. In article 1" The founding fathers established it in the Constution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election." A compromise is good for our country and it was created a long time ago might be older than dirt. Also in article 1" The electors are generally chosen by the candidates politicle party." So atleast the people in whom the people are trusting to put their votes in is by someone that the head of the politicle party trusts.  To conclude the electoral colege system needs to be retired and the country needs to vote off of popular voting. The people need to represent them selves and not by some random person who could mess with the voting data to get who they want to win the election. Each state has to give up all of its votes to one side of the 2 parties.		0
The Callenge of Exploring Venus  Venus is the second planet from are sun . Venus is like earth twin it's the closest planet to Earth . Venus has been a challenging place to examine more closely . People have tried to study venus since t's so close but it has not always worked out.  So we have Earth , Venus , and Mars . those all have differeces in speed meaning that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times Venus . since Venus sometimes s right around the corner .humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on the planet . every previous mission was unmanned , no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. This is why no spaceship has touched on Venus in more than three decades . This made it hard for humans to study .  Venus has temperatures of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit the atmospheric pressure is 90 times higher then what we experience on are own planet. These conditions are extreme . in the story it say's that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any plant in our solar system, the wearther erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface . That's why when we tried to land on Venus are craft got distroded .  Venus used to be like earth but mostly not anymore . since Venus is like what its like we can't take samples from rocks,gas etc. we would have to dig deeper into are work so we can find out why Venus is the way it is. Its good that they are working to better are craft to find out more about Venus .NASA is working on something that's seem like it would work well for Venus .  Venus is worthy of studying despite the dangers because if we stop we will never know what it's really like why it does the things it does . If we keep trying we will have the best craft and it will work . I know everybody wants to know if we can have life on a planet and Venus might just be the one . although Venus made it hard for humans to study it also gave them light weight on how to make the craft better and to know that it is dangrous so they know now that they need better craft.   		0
 Limiting car usage: Staying put for the sake of our planet  It appears that the harmful effects of car usage are indisputable. Not only does it cause air pollution, but it also exacerbates climate change due to the high levels of carbon dioxide emitted. Additionally, the carbon monoxide in the air from cars can cause serious health issues like pneumonia or even death. Luckily, we can take action against this by limiting our use of cars and opting for more environmentally friendly modes of transportation like biking or using public transit. I believe that if we all work together to limit our car usage, we can make a significant impact on creating a healthier and safer environment.   There is no denying the fact that cars are a major cause of air pollution. Approximately one-third of greenhouse gas emissions are caused by transportation, with a large chunk of that coming from cars. Not only do cars emit harmful gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide into the air, but they also release fine particulate matter that can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause respiratory problems. By limiting our car usage, we can significantly reduce the amount of air pollution we are causing, thereby reducing the health risks associated with it.   In addition to air pollution, cars also contribute to climate change. As cars burn gasoline, they release carbon dioxide into the air. This gas has been shown to trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to an increase in global temperatures and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts. By limiting our car usage, we can help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and mitigate the effects of climate change.   Previously, I argued that limiting car usage can improve the health of the environment by reducing air pollution and mitigating climate change. However, limiting car usage can also improve the health of individuals by reducing the amount of carbon monoxide in the air. Carbon monoxide can cause serious health issues like pneumonia or even death in high enough concentrations. By reducing the amount of carbon monoxide in the air, we can help keep people healthy and safe.   In conclusion, I hope to have convinced you of the benefits of limiting car usage. Not only does it reduce air pollution and climate change, but it also helps to improve public health by reducing the amount of carbon monoxide in the air. Even small changes in our individual car usage can make a big difference when we all work together. While it may be difficult to completely give up our cars, I believe that if we each do our part, we can make a significant impact on the health of our environment and the safety of our citizens.   This is a revised version of the essay; I apologize for any confusion caused by the grammatical error in the previous version.		1
Hey there!  So, you know how sometimes your parents or teachers tell you what to do and you're like, "Ugh, I wish I could make my own decisions!"?  Well, let me tell you why making your own decisions is super important.  First of all, when you make your own decisions, you learn stuff. Like, actual stuff. You learn how to think critically and solve problems on your own. It's like, you get to be the boss of your own life and make choices that actually matter. It's not like your parents or teachers are gonna do it for you, so you gotta step up and do it yourself. Plus, when you make your own decisions, you feel more in control of your life. It's like, you're not just a passive observer, you're actually making things happen.  Another thing is, when you make your own decisions, you get to be who you really are. Like, you don't have to pretend to be someone else or do things that you don't really want to do. You can just be yourself and do what makes you happy. It's like, you don't have to worry about what other people think, you can just do what feels right for you. And that's a pretty cool feeling, if you ask me.  Now, I know some people might be like, "But what about when you make bad decisions?"  Like, what even is a bad decision, right?  I mean, maybe you'll make some mistakes, but that's just part of the learning process, you know? It's like, you'll figure things out as you go along and become a better person because of it. And even if you do make bad decisions, at least you'll know that you made them yourself and you can learn from them. It's like, you won't have to blame anyone else for your mistakes.  So, in conclusion, making your own decisions is pretty important. It's like, it's your life, so you should get to decide how it goes. You'll learn stuff, feel more in control, and be yourself. And even if you make		1
Dear state senator,  I do not agree with the idea of the electoral college. The United States' president should be elected by popular vote and not just by a specific amount of electors. One great reason why the president of the US should be elected by popular vote is because the citizens won't really get to choose what president that they want to have for the next one or two terms. It is also unfair to the people that vote for their president (according to source 2.) We should really stick to the president being elected by popular vote.  The president should be elected by popular vote because the people are practically not voting for their president. The majority of voter aren't voting for the president, but they're voting for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president(as said in source 2.) The electors that actually elect the president can be anyone not holding public office. The citizens that vote can not always control whom their electors vote for.  It's official that the electoral college is also unfair to voters. Voters are voting for other electors to then elect the president. What if to say there was a tie after voting for the candidates? The election would be handed down to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations vote on the president. The electoral college is also unfair because of the win-take-all system in each state. Candidates won't stay in states where they know they a zero percent chance of winning, they'll only focus on the states with tight races.  So there is why I agree that the electoral college should be abolished and the government should change the voting system so that the president is voted by popular vote. We need to abolish the electoral college because the presidents that are being elected are not being elected by the citizens, but instead the president is elected by the electors that are elected by the citizens. The electoral college process should go no further because it is unfair, outdated, and irrational. I really long to see a change in voting systems soon.                     		0
Cars are becoming a must in today's society. In some places, people live and survive without a motorized vehicle. People don't have to stop using cars altogether, but should be able to limit themselves to save of world from pollution creating a better environment to live in.  Some people don't understand the severity of pollution and how much cars contribute to that. Pollution is said to become Earths demise, with cars producing and letting out so much smog, it seems as if the Earths demise could be near. According to Robert Duffer, Paris has "enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." This evidence of Paris giving a partial ban shows how detrimental cars can have on Earth environment. Further examination reveals, a situation where Bogota has even issued a " carfree day" stated by Andrew Selsky. This source shows us that with even one day without using a car could be a useful plan for all places. People of today don't need to not use their cars, just use their cars either less per day or per week.  Although some may say, we need cars to get to work or to go to the grocery store, they can always just use public transportation. Buses are already running even if you are in a car so why not use them instead of polluting the air even more. In Bogota, when they have their carfree day, most people either "hiked","biked", "skated" or "took buses" as a mean of transportation. More evidence shows a scenario where the Environmental Protection Agency is encouraging a "car reduced" community, stated by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Resources such as this one shows that if the United States environmental Protection Agency is concerned about our pollution rate why shouldn't we? If we cut down on our use of cars, pollution rate can drop extremely down causing a better living environment.  When you stop to think why cars have become so prevelant, there is no exact reasoning. If we don't even know our exact reasoning for having a car, in a case that we can't rely on buses or our own two legs to provided why are we risking the safty of our Earth in order to use them? Cars aren't the slightest bit the problem, how and how often we use them is becoming the problem, if we limit our use of cars our advantage would be the single best thing in live, happiness and peace of life.		0
cowboy riding wave article essay  i was never one for farming, always preferred the wide open spaces of the ocean waves. So joining the Seagoing Cowboys program back in '43 was a no-brainer for me. The heck with tending to cows and eating grass all day long, I wanted to ride the waves and see the world! And that's exactly what i got to do! During my time with the program, I was lucky enough to visit places like Africa, Argentina, Belgium, and China. I even got to see the pyramids in Egypt! And let me tell you, there's nothing quite like seeing the world from the back of a cowboat. But it's not just about the adventures and the sights. The Seagoing Cowboys program also gave me a sense of purpose. It was like i was doing my part to help out with the war effort. And let me tell you, there's no better feeling than that. So if you're thinking about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, I say go for it! You'll get to see the world, experience adventures, and make a difference. What more could you ask for?   I am going to conclude with a quote that I live by, "The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page." - St. Augustine.   I hope you all have a great day! 		1
Cell Phone Use While Driving  Cell phones have grown into a significant part of people's day-to-day lives. Phones are primarily hand-held, which when used while driving is the cause of both minor and major road accidents. Given the importance of cell phones in people's lives, it is not practical to completely ban their use, but it makes more sense to identify safer ways to use the cellphone while driving. Numerous technologies have been developed with the purpose to make driving while using cell phones much safer like virtual assistance, speech-to-text software, and Bluetooth headsets. Practicality dictates that rules and regulations have to be designed to address hands-free cell phone. These laws will encourage safe practices, especially where fines and jail times are the consequence of breaching said laws (White, Eiser, and Harris 323). Drivers should be able to use their cell phones while driving only when hands-free, at appropriate times, and by the law.  The use of cell phones, either hand-held or hands-free, causes distractions and is dangerous to the people in the car and pedestrians. Drivers are encouraged to avoid all use of their mobile devices while on the road to ensure they are focused on driving. Nonetheless, altogether banning the use of cell phones is not helpful since phones have become a part of life. Therefore, it makes sense to identify safer ways to use cell phones while driving that do not endanger people (White, Eiser, and Harris 330). A study conducted by researchers concluded that the use of hands-free cell phone tech minimizes the time spent on the manual tasks in cell phones, particularly when compared to hand-held cell phones. Also, despite these facts, drivers are still likely to use handheld phones even though there is a safer alternative (Soccolich et al. 26).  The most effective hands-free device is the Bluetooth headset, which helps the driver answer the phone without handling it or fiddling with dials. The driver has to use the headset to both speak and listen. Furthermore, voice activation should be enabled to eliminate the need to touch the phone buttons completely. One of the best strategies, when a driver has to talk to someone, is to park the car, make the call, and switch to the Bluetooth headset, which eliminates the need to touch any controls when driving. Also, drivers can use virtual assistant software to make calls such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant (Hoy 82). When it comes to texting while driving, drivers are advised not to since it distracts from the task and can cause fatal accidents. Luckily, there are speech-to-text technologies on most smartphones that eliminate the need to hold one's phone while driving.  In conclusion, any distractions are a hazard to safe driving, including the use of both hand-held and hands-free cell phones. An appropriate solution is to identify ways in which drivers can drive while using their cellphones without unnecessarily endangering themselves or other pedestrians. Consequently, laws have to focus more on better ways to allow the use of mobile phones rather than altogether banning the use of phones while driving. Cell phones have become a significant part of people's day-to-day lives. All things revolves around staying connected via these devices. Therefore, drivers should be able to use their cell phones while driving only when hands-free and at appropriate times.  Works Cited  Hoy, Matthew B.

I think making the students do community service is a great idea! Kids/teenagers need to learn responsibility and kindness while growing up by doing things for other people. I think it will make the kids a lot less selfish and want to help others when they get older and become young adults. Community service is great for teens of any age to learn how to care for someone else.  Good things that teens can do to help the community would be stuff like going outside and walking along the streets in their town and picking up litter. They could even go to the nursing home in their community or around their community and help the workers and the residents with anything they can. Students could even stay after school on certain days and help the janitor with anything he/she needs cleaned, or work in the concession stand during school sporting events. Maybe even the science teachers would like to help the students with starting a garden in a spot outside, we have plenty of room! The garden would supply food which could be given to homeless shelters or food pantry's.  I know that some of the students here already do community service for fun or even for projects for school, but I really think it would be a great idea for the school to meet up with some people that do community service and offer to have people to come and help them with it. They could possibly come weekly or even monthly and take a group of students out and do whatever they need them to help with. Community service is a good way for kids to learn to work with people and help their community. We should definitely do more of it around here! It would set good examples for other schools and maybe even help the environment!		0
 The electoral college is a system used in the United States to elect the president. In the system, each state is awarded a number of electoral votes equal to the number of representatives it has in Congress. The candidate who wins the majority of electoral votes becomes the president. The current system was established by the framers of the US Constitution, but it has been the subject of much debate and controversy over the years. The question is whether the electoral college works effectively or if it needs to be reformed.  One argument in favor of the electoral college is that it represents the will of the people. Each state is given a certain amount of representation based on its population, and a candidate who wins in states with large populations will be more likely to win the election. This system ensures that the preferences of smaller and larger states are taken into account, and it requires candidates to pay attention to all parts of the country, not just urban areas.  Another argument in favor of the electoral college is that it is a check on the power of states. Each state has its own unique interests and needs, and the electoral college gives states the ability to have their voices heard in the election process. This can help to prevent a candidate from winning with little regard for the concerns of certain states.  However, the electoral college also has its flaws. One major problem with the system is that it can reward a candidate for winning in swing states, rather than voting for the best candidate. This can lead to   swing state strategizing   and a lack of attention to other issues. Additionally, small states with low populations have a disproportionate amount of influence in the election process, as their electoral votes can be the difference between winning and losing.  Another problem with the electoral college is that it does not represent the actual popular vote. In some elections, the candidate who won the popular vote lost the electoral vote, and in 2016, Donald Trump won the election despite losing the popular vote by nearly three million votes. This can undermine the legitimacy of the election and suggest that the candidate who won the popular vote is not the best choice for the country.  Overall, the electoral college has its advantages and disadvantages. It represents the will of the people and gives states a voice in the election process, but it can also be influenced by political strategists and small states and does not always reflect the actual popular vote. Whether the electoral college needs to be reformed is a matter of debate, but it is clear that it needs to be re-evaluated and improved to ensure that it works effectively for all Americans.		1
The electoral college has many inherint flaws that make it less desirable than a simple election by popular vote. It's only rebuttals to said flaws are weak, and provide little to no reason why the college is beneficial. So there is no real reason to have it in the first place. Popular vote stands to not only correct the errors of the electoral college, but also to refine our voting system. It would accomplish this by closer to a real democracy, and forcing the candidates to win over more people.  A democracy has long been revered as one of the best forms of government. It is more liberating than a dictatorship or monarchy in which people are governed by a higher class, which is more often than not decided by someone other than themselves. In a democracy however, people are given the ability to put who they desire in office. They have the ability to be governed by the person of their choice. This, however, is impeded upon by the electoral college. Because what it does is simply insert a middle man into an otherwise democratic society. We are forced to rely on people we elect to vote for us. Which is irrational as it is completely unecessary. The extra step only sets us up for deception and betrayal. I mean why would you trust a man on the street to cast a vote for you when doing so yourself is much more reliable?  Though why does it even matter if the candidate you want to vote for won't even come to your state? There's obviously no reason to vote democrat if your say will simply be overshadowed by the wave of republicans in your area. With popular vote though, candidates should be more inclined to visit as many states as possible and get their message out there. Because a 51% vote in a state no longer means a 100% victory. With the new influx of political campaigns, perhaps more people are swayed from their usual path of voting. While yes, there are neutral states that need a push either way, you're not going to increase your votes ten-fold by pushing past that 50% barrier. You actually have to earn every vote you get.  There is no real reason to keep the electoral college. It serves as a pointless middle man to an otherwise great government. Popular vote requires more out of the candidates, and puts more say into the individual vote.     		0
In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This movement is based on the belief that cars are harmful to the environment, contribute to traffic congestion, and make cities less livable. There are many advantages to limiting car usage, both for individuals and for society as a whole.  One advantage of limiting car usage is that it can help to improve air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and they contribute to the formation of smog. When people drive less, there is less pollution in the air, which can improve people's health.  Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can help to reduce traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, and it can waste a lot of time and money. When people drive less, there is less traffic on the roads, which can make commuting and running errands more efficient.  Limiting car usage can also make cities more livable. Cars take up a lot of space, and they can make it difficult to walk, bike, or take public transportation. When people drive less, there is more space for people to move around, and cities become more pedestrian-friendly.  In addition, limiting car usage can help to reduce noise pollution. Cars are a major source of noise pollution, and they can make it difficult to enjoy peace and quiet in one's home or neighborhood. When people drive less, there is less noise pollution, which can improve people's quality of life.  Finally, limiting car usage can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, and they contribute to climate change. When people drive less, there are fewer greenhouse gas emissions, which can help to protect the environment.  In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can help to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, make cities more livable, reduce noise pollution, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These are all important goals, and it is important to find ways to reduce car usage in order to achieve them.		1
Hey, I'm just an average 8th grader, but I'll give it a shot! Here's my essay on the importance of self-reliance and making individual decisions:  Self-reliance and making individual decisions are super important for personal growth. When we rely on ourselves, we learn to think for ourselves and make choices that are best for us. Like, if we want to buy a house, we should be the ones to make the decision, not our parents or friends. It's our money, and we should get to choose how we want to spend it.  Same thing with getting married. If we want to get married, it's our choice. We should be the ones to decide who we want to spend the rest of our lives with, not our parents or society. And don't even get me started on dropping out of school. If we want to drop out, it's our decision. We should be the ones to decide whether or not we want to continue our education.  But here's the thing  ?sometimes asking for someone else's opinion can be detrimental. Like, if we're not sure what to do, it's okay to ask for advice. But if we're just doing it because we don't want to take responsibility for our own decisions, that's not cool. We should be the ones to make the decisions, not just because we don't want to take the blame if it doesn't work out.  For example, I know this one kid who wanted to buy a car. His parents were like, "No way, you're too young!" But he really wanted it, so he saved up his own money and bought it himself. And you know what? He ended up loving it! It was a great decision for him, and he learned a lot from it.  But on the other hand, there's this other kid who wanted to drop out of school. His parents were like, "No way, you have to finish high school!" But he didn't really want to, so he dropped out and ended up getting a job at McDonald's. And you know what? He's still struggling to make ends meet, and he wishes he had finished school.  So, in conclusion, self-re		1
Reducing car usuage coul greatly benefit us all. it would decrease death rates, pollution, and money costs.  As towns such as Vauban and Paris participate in car free days, they greatly reduce the amount of pollution that would have become that day. their hard work and enthusiasm even encouraged other cities and parts of the country to join. our pollution rate is much to high for the only planet and space we can live on. increasing it daily will only hurt us and be fatal in the long run.  Death rates caused by cars is another reason to have a few days off from them. Fatalaties caused in accidents, hit and runs, and wrecks happen multiple times daily. a few days or even just one of no/reduced car usage could save the lives of many.  money costs are a large complaint in our society today, especially money involving cars. from the cost of the car itself to the dollars to per gallon used every week, nobody likes to spend that much money on their vehicle. well we wouldnt have to as often if we did have dayswhere cars were fined if used.  citizens should reduce the use of cars to help with financial issues, death rates, and pollution.         		0
 It is a pleasure to be constantly engaged in activities that bring us fulfillment and satisfaction. By consistently pursuing our goals and aspirations, we can achieve more than we ever thought possible. It is essential to practice and work towards the things we desire.  When we set our minds to a particular goal, we must be willing to put in the effort to achieve it. For instance, if I aspire to become a police officer, I must study hard to become more than just a police officer. If I want to purchase an iPhone 5, I must work harder to acquire an iPhone 8. If I want to visit Generic_City with $600, I must save more to accumulate $1000. It is crucial to consider our desires and goals before embarking on any activity.  We must also learn to manage our finances effectively. When we are idle, we do not achieve anything that we desire. To achieve our goals, we must work hard and think like an idle. For example, if I want to purchase a Toyota, I must work hard and think like an idle to work harder and earn more money to purchase a BMW. If I want to graduate, I must study harder and think like an idle to pass all my classes and obtain a better diploma. It is essential to think about our future before engaging in any idle activity.  In conclusion, it is a pleasure to be constantly engaged in activities that bring us fulfillment and satisfaction. By consistently pursuing our goals and aspirations, we can achieve more than we ever thought possible. It is essential to practice and work towards the things we desire, learn to manage our finances effectively, and think about our future before engaging in any idle activity. By doing so, we can achieve our dreams and live a better life.		1
Phones & Driving Essay  People use their phones for just about everything such as texting, talking,and the internet. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. But you cannot do these while driving. You can kill someone if you're not focused on the road. we have become focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our phones. Using a phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for some good reasons below according to the law.  1. Its illegal 2. You are much more likely to have a wreck 3. Texting and driving puts all the drivers sharing the road with you at risk, too, because you are unable to navigate the road while looking down at the phone in your lap.  According online 11 teenagers die every day due to texting and driving. Teenagers are 400% more likely to get into an accident from texting and driving. AT&T's Teen Driver Survey found that 97% of teenagers think it's dangerous, while 43% of them engage in the activity anyway. According to the National Safety Council, cell phone use while driving leads to 6 million accidents per year. Did you know 520 pedestrians were killed by distracted drivers in the United States in 2014.  Moral of this essay you shouldnt drive and be on your phone it causes alot of people to be killed   		0
Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage  Introduction: In recent years, there has been a growing trend in various parts of the world to limit car usage in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative modes of transportation. This essay will explore the advantages of limiting car usage based on information from multiple sources. By adopting car-free or car-reduced lifestyles, individuals and communities can experience numerous benefits, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, enhanced physical and mental well-being, and greater accessibility to public transportation and local amenities.  Body Paragraph 1: Improved Air Quality and Reduced Emissions Limiting car usage can significantly improve air quality, as cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal's article on German suburb Vauban, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. This data highlights the pressing need to reduce car usage in order to combat climate change. By minimizing the number of vehicles on the road, communities can reduce harmful pollutants and improve public health.  Body Paragraph 2: Reduced Traffic Congestion Another advantage of limiting car usage is a reduction in traffic congestion. The passage about Paris implementing a partial driving ban due to smog demonstrates how limiting car usage can alleviate traffic congestion and improve overall mobility. By encouraging alternative forms of transportation such as public transit, cycling, and walking, cities can reduce the number of cars on the roads and improve traffic flow. This not only benefits those who choose alternative modes of transportation but also individuals who rely on cars by reducing travel time.  Body Paragraph 3: Enhanced Physical and Mental Well-being Limiting car usage has positive impacts on both physical and mental well-being. As stated in the passage on Vauban, residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and less stressed. By walking or cycling instead of driving, individuals can engage in regular physical exercise, improve cardiovascular health, and reduce the risk of obesity. Additionally, active transportation options such as walking or cycling have been linked to improved mental health and reduced feelings of anxiety and depression.  Body Paragraph 4: Greater Accessibility to Public Transportation and Local Amenities Another advantage of limiting car usage is the increased accessibility to public transportation and local amenities. When communities are designed with smart planning principles in mind, as seen in Vauban's car-free streets, residents have easier access to public transportation options such as trams and buses. This accessibility allows individuals to have more sustainable and convenient travel options. Additionally, by designing communities where essential services and amenities are within walking distance, individuals may rely less on cars for everyday activities like grocery shopping, which in turn reduces the need for excessive car usage.  Conclusion: As demonstrated by the passages analyzed, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals and communities. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and alleviating traffic congestion, we can create more sustainable and livable cities. Additionally, limiting car usage promotes physical and mental well-being while increasing accessibility to public transportation and local amenities. As the global population grows and the impact of climate change becomes more apparent, it is crucial that we consider the advantages of limiting car usage and work towards implementing smart planning principles in our communities.		1
Homework is like, totally a big debate among educators and students. Some peeps think it's, like, super important for learning and all that jazz, while others think it's, like, way too stressful and stuff. Me, personally, I think homework is, like, kinda necessary, but also kinda not. Let me explain.  First off, homework is, like, a great way to reinforce what we learned in class. Like, if we're learning about, like, math or science or whatever, homework helps us, like, practice and stuff. It's, like, a way to make sure we understand the material and all that. And, like, if we don't do our homework, we might, like, fall behind or something. That's not good, right?  But, like, on the other hand, homework can be, like, super stressful, man. I mean, sometimes we get, like, a ton of homework, and it's, like, hard to keep up, you know? And if we don't, like, finish it all, we might, like, get in trouble or something. That's not cool, bro.  Also, homework can, like, take away from other important things, like, extracurricular activities and stuff. Like, if we're, like, super busy with homework, we might not have time for, like, sports or clubs or whatever. And that's, like, not good, because those things are, like, important too.  So, like, in conclusion, homework is, like, kinda necessary, but also kinda not. It's, like, important for learning and all that, but it can also be, like, super stressful and take away from other important things. I think, like, a good balance is, like, key, you know? Like, we should, like, have some homework, but not, like, too much or anything. That way, we can, like, learn and stuff, but also have time for other things. Word.		1
Scientists want to study Venus for a variety of reasons, it seems. They have discovered valleys, mountains, and craters in Venus's surface. NASA seems to be working on several ideas for machiens to go down to Venus's surface as well.  NASA is working on a few different projects for going down to Venus's surface. One of these projects is a set of simplified electonics made, or coated, with silicon carbide. This material is proven, in a simulation chamber, to be able to handle conditions not unlike those on the surface of Venus. It'll have to be able to handle acidic rain, lightning stikes, and extremely high temperatures. 800* F, in fact.  But, why would anybody even want to study Venus? It's so brutal over their. Well, scientists think that long ago, it may have been an Earth-like planet. This is where the mountains, etc come in. Because Earth and Venus both have these rock formations. The atmosphere is almost 97% carbon dioxide, which could have come from severe global warming, which brings the temp. up to 800*F. We're slowly heading that way, so people on Mars, in a long, long time, might be making these same observations, about Earth. Or maybe, they already did, a long, long time ago. Either way, NASA wants to be able to make closer observations about Venus. They think hovering 30 miles above its surface would still be at temperatures of around 170* F, which is still pretty warm, you'll want a lot of AC. But, the radiation levels won't be unlike that of earth, and the air pressure would be about that of sea level on earth. So, it'd be rough living, but it'd be fairly survivable for humans to live in.  So, again, Venus is a tough planet, it's atmosphere is absolutely crazy dangerous. There's lighting, earthquakes, and freaking volcanoes!!  Plus, it's atmospheric pressure, is 90 times that of Earths!!!!  But yeah, it's definitely be great to get some of those rock samples or gas samples from Venus. I think it'd definitely be a planet worth studying.		0
 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a method used by researchers and experts in the field of facial expressions to analyze and decode emotions and expressions. It was developed by Paul Ekman in the 1970s and has since been widely adopted as a tool for research on human emotions and facial expression. This system allows researchers to code and analyze a wide range of facial expressions, including happy, angry, sad, and surprised expressions. FACS is used in many areas of research, including psychology, neuroscience, marketing, and law enforcement, to better understand human emotions and to develop interventions aimed at improving emotional regulation and expression.  FACS is based on the idea that facial expressions are not only influenced by emotions but also by social and cultural norms, attention, and physical state. The system identifies seven basic categories of facial expressions, including happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear, and contempt. Each category of expression is composed of multiple "action units," which are specific movements and configurations of facial muscles. The system provides a comprehensive framework for coding and analyzing facial expressions, allowing researchers to identify patterns of expression and to classify emotions with a high degree of accuracy.  One of the strengths of FACS is its ability to provide objective and reliable measures of facial expression. Researchers can use the system to codify facial expressions in a standardized and systematic way, allowing for comparisons across different studies and samples. This consistency in coding can help reduce variability and increase the reliability of findings. Additionally, FACS can be used across a wide range of populations, including children, adults, and animals, providing a valuable tool for research on development and evolution.  However, FACS also has some limitations. For example, it assumes that facial expressions are always a reflection of genuine emotions, but it is possible that people may pretend to have certain emotions or may mask their true feelings. Furthermore, FACS is highly dependent on the observer's knowledge and expertise, making it difficult for non-experts to use the system consistent		1
 Seeking multiple opinions can be beneficial for individuals in a variety of ways. By obtaining advice from different people, individuals can gain a broader perspective on a situation and understand the various points of view that exist. This can be especially helpful when making difficult decisions or when facing a challenge.  One of the main benefits of seeking multiple opinions is that it allows individuals to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a situation. When seeking advice from multiple people, individuals can gain insights and perspectives that they may not have considered before. This can help them make more informed decisions and avoid potential pitfalls.  Additionally, seeking advice from people with different experiences and backgrounds can provide individuals with valuable insights and guidance. For example, someone who has gone through a similar experience may be able to provide guidance on how to navigate the situation in a way that is more effective.  It is also important to consider the motivations behind seeking advice. Sometimes, individuals may need advice to help them overcome a challenge or make a difficult decision. In these cases, seeking advice can provide them with the motivation and support they need to move forward.  Overall, seeking multiple opinions can be a valuable tool for individuals looking to gain a broader perspective on a situation and make more informed decisions. By considering different points of view and seeking guidance from people with different experiences and backgrounds, individuals can improve their decision-making and achieve greater success in their personal and professional lives.		1
 Venus, often referred to as the Earth's sister planet due to its similarities in size and composition, is the second planet from the sun. The planet is known for its hot and humid atmosphere, thick clouds, and surface temperatures that can reach up to 460-degree Celsius (860-degree Fahrenheit). Venus has captivated the curiosity of scientists and explorers alike, leading to numerous missions and studies aimed at understanding the planet's unique environment and potential for hosting life.  The first successful mission to explore Venus was the Soviet Union's Venera 11 and Venera 12 spacecraft, launched in 1978. These space probes were equipped with instruments that allowed scientists to study the planet's surface and atmosphere. The probes discovered that Venus has a solid surface, similar to Earth, but it is covered in volcanoes and mountains with deep, steep valleys. These features are a result of the planet's intense volcanic activity and the slow movement of its thin, crust-like layer.  One of the most fascinating discoveries made by the Venera spacecraft was the presence of sulfuric acid clouds. Venus' atmosphere is toxic and thick, with a pressure that is 92 times greater than Earth's at sea level. The clouds of sulfuric acid are able to trap heat and moisture, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that leads to extreme temperatures and pressure on the planet's surface. This runaway greenhouse effect makes Venus one of the hottest planets in our solar system.  In order to explore the surface of Venus, scientists are planning a future mission to the planet. NASA has proposed the Venus Sample Return mission, which would involve sending an orbiter followed by a lander to the planet to collect samples and bring them back to Earth. The success of this mission would be a significant step in our understanding of the planet's composition and potential for life.  The prospects of finding life on Venus are still unclear, but scientists believe that it is possible. Venus has water, which is a key ingredient for life, and there is evidence of geological activity on the planet, which could lead to the formation of life-sustaining habitats. Further research and exploration of Venus will provide valuable insights into the potential for life on other planets in our solar system.  In conclusion, Venus is a fascinating and mysterious planet that has captured the imagination of scientists and explorers for decades. The intense heat and pressure on the planet's surface, along with its toxic atmosphere, make it a challenging environment to explore. However, the potential for finding life on Venus makes it a worthwhile pursuit. Future missions, such as the Venus Sample Return mission, will provide us with a deeper understanding of this unique and captivating planet.		1
Generic_Name  Generic_Name  English 8 Honors  March 11, 2020  Optional Extracurricular Activities  Should it be forced that all students participate in at least one after-school activity? I believe students should not be forced to join an extracurricular activity. It is definitely a great experience and attention should be brought to it but not as a requirement. There are multiple draw backs and problems it can cause for families. At first, you might think it's a great idea but if you really think about what has to be done so that children can attend meetings, you might change your mind.  One of great things about public schools is that they're free and most things are cheaper. This is extremely helpful for families who are financially struggling but want their kids to have an education. A lot of after-school clubs or sport teams do things that might cost more than what some families can afford. Parents could feel stressed because they know they can't afford it but at the same time, want their kids to be happy and healthy. Financial problems can cause problems for some families, especially when the school tells them their children are required to do an extracurricular.  Some extracurricular activities don't end until 5 p. m. or later. There are so many students that struggle with focusing and need more time to unwind after a long day. If they are required to participate in an after-school club, this brings even more stress to them. They will be tired when they get home and still have homework to do, causing a student to be up later, which affects their sleep schedule. The less sleep they get, the more tired they are during the school day. affecting their learning ability. Forcing students to attend a sport or other activity can affect their performance in school in a negative way.  Another drawback that forcing students to attend an extracurricular activity is the need of transportation. Public schools transport kids to school and back by bus, which makes the life of families easier. Maybe parents work till 6 p. m. and therefore can't pick up their child. Forcing students to participate in after-school clubs or sports can be a problem for families that aren't able to pick up their kids. Of course, parents can car-pool but that just adds extra stress to the parents who already do so much. They might think that they have to pay back other parents that help transport their kids. Having extracurricular activities not required can let parents find a club that is suitable to their ability to transport their children home.  In conclusion, there are so many problems that forcing students to participate in one or more extracurricular activities causes. The extra stress on families is a lot to handle and will not make things easier. Although joining clubs or sports in your school is a fantastic experience and great thing to have on future resumes, it should be optional. Schools should bring attention to the activities to get students interested instead of requiring it. That's why I disagree with the idea that a school would have it be a necessity for students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. 		0

Character traits can also be used to form one's identity, with people using them to establish a sense of self-esteem and direction. It is therefore essential to have an understanding of one's own character traits, as this can lead to improved confidence and personal fulfillment. In conclusion, the origin and influence of character traits is an extremely relevant matter that can have far-reaching implications in regards to a person's life and identity.		1
 Failure is an inevitable part of the journey towards success. While some people may see it as a setback, others view it as an opportunity to learn and grow. In my experience, failure has been a valuable teacher, helping me to identify areas where I need to improve and giving me the motivation to work harder.  When I was in 9th grade, I struggled with math. I found that I didn't understand the questions and made many mistakes. However, instead of giving up, I took the time to review my work and identify where I had gone wrong. I then worked hard to fix my mistakes and improve my understanding of the subject. With the help of my teacher and family, I was able to overcome my struggles and become proficient in math.  Similarly, when I first came to the United States, I struggled with English. I made many mistakes when speaking and writing, but I was determined to improve. I sought help from my teachers and friends, and even looked up words in the dictionary when I was unsure of their meaning. With time and effort, I was able to improve my English skills and become more comfortable communicating in the language.  While failure can be discouraging, it's important to remember that it's not the end of the road. People who are around us need to help motivate us and give us the energy to try again. Just like a sports coach motivates their team before a game, we can draw strength from the support of others.  It's also important to understand that failure is a natural part of life. Everyone experiences setbacks, but it's how we respond to them that matters. When we embrace failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, we can use it to propel ourselves forward towards success.  In conclusion, failure is an essential part of the journey towards success. It's important to view it as a valuable teacher and use it to identify areas where we need to improve. With hard work, determination, and the support of those around us, we can overcome our struggles and achieve our goals.		1

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes online. When a student is sick, or simply can not attend class, they can just go online and be present digitally. Sometimes, kids are not comfortable with attending school. They can just stay home and get the same material as someone who would go to school. In today's world we should take advantage of the technology we have, and use it to give everyone the opportunity to learn.  Once, in the 7th grade, I obtained this horrible sickness that lead me to be absent for two whole weeks. When I got back, I was so behind in my class work. This lead to my grades slipping, and having to get tutors to just pass my classes. The simple solution to this problem is attending classes while I was home on my computer. I could of video conference in all of my classes to maintain where I needed to be for that year. also, I could of further analyzed the class by going to the school website and seeing what my teacher had uploaded for studying.  My brother, Generic_Name, was bullied harshly in middle school. People would make fun of him because he was overweight and had red hair. Some days, he would come home crying, because of how cruel everyone was to him. This could of lead to permanent psychological damage to my brother, luckily he recovered. The simply way of avoiding this problem was attending an online school. He could of avoided his bullies by doing this. When the first incident occurred he could of just finished that school year online, away from his troubles.  on the other hand, you need to present in the classroom to get the full learning experience. You can't just simply not attend school and expect to learn everything online. You need a teacher to further explain the subject you are being taught, and for them to answer any questions that the students has to ask. For my brother's problem, he needed to face his bullies and stand up for himself. You can't just hide away from your problems in life. problems you face in school is good life lessons that you will learn from.  In all, online schooling is great opportunity for students to have in school systems. It helps with sick days, tragic experiences and catching up on work. Plus, being able to work online can allow you to go at your pace, so you don't feel rushed. This distance learning may have some tweaks that needs to be fixed, but students do benefit from attending classes from home.		0
Is studying Venus a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In my opinion if you would like to devote your life to the study of venus and go preform test on Venus then what ever makes you happy. How ever the author is more on the side of why go and waist all of the resources needed to go to Venus.  In the begining of this passage the author states "  human have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason," which leads me to beileve that he doesnt understand why they keep trying and waisting resources and money. Then in paragraph four he states " if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even disscusing further visits to its surface" which moves me to think that he beileves that Venus is so "inhospitable" that we shouldnt even waist time experimenting to in hopes find our second earth.  When reading this I hope you take time to think about the importantce of this article and you have time to think what should we do? Should we go do more test in hopes Venus could be our second earth or just stay here and spend the time and money fixing our earth.		0
In this essay I will be writing an argumentative essay over "The Face on Mars" theory. This is a very argumentative subject that can have two sides to itt based on the factual evidence in the passage."The Face on Mars" was consider to have been made by alien lifeform. "The Face on Mars" is 2 miles long and is a major pop icon.  I think "The Face on Mars" is just a huge rock formation that was formed by the planet's weathering and erosion from nearby rocks. Since this planet has a rain season and has a very windy winter, it could've been made by weathering and erosion. Another thing that makes me believe that the face is just a rock is because the dark eyes, nose, and mouth look like shadows from the camera and the sun. One last thing about the face is that if alien lifeform made this why woud they make it 2 miles wide? This has just been one side of the argument, I will write the rest.  I think that this face is made by alien lifeform because it really looks a face. This face could've possibly been a temple or worshiping place for these lifeforms long ago. It could've been a tomb for their leader or king that might've died. If these aliens were going to make a rock this big and that wide it would be for someone or something to catch it's eye. So aliens could've made this or they might not have.  I think that ultimately this is just a coincidence because if aliens are real or were real we would have got aa picture of one or saw some remains of one. And the rock is probably just a mesa or a big landform that was made by weathering and erosion. The face of the rock is most likely just shadows from the camera angle and the sun. And another thing, when the camera passed over the mesa, it was a cloudy and rainy day, making the camera lens wet.  I think that the rock is a mesa. The proof is in the article and it would have been noticed in the pictures if there was aliens living on Mars. So the non-alien side wins this argument over this one. The rock is not a face it is a normal rock.          		0

 Dear Senator,  I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College and its role in choosing the President of the United States. I strongly believe that the Electoral College is an essential part of our electoral system and should be retained.  One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is that it provides a sense of certainty in the outcome of the election. Unlike a popular vote, where the winner is determined by the margin of votes, the Electoral College is less likely to produce a disputed election. This is because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is usually much higher than their share of the popular vote.  Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign throughout the country, not just in key swing states. When candidates focus on winning in swing states, they tend to ignore other regions with fewer electoral votes, even though those regions may have a significant number of voters. By keeping the Electoral College, candidates are forced to consider the needs and concerns of voters from all regions of the country, not just those in key swing states.  Furthermore, the Electoral College provides a way for smaller states to have a greater impact on the election. In a popular vote, large states with many voters may drown out the voices of smaller states with fewer voters. By awarding electoral votes based on a state's population, the Electoral College ensures that the needs and concerns of all states are considered.  It is also important to note that the Electoral College has a long history and is deeply ingrained in our political system. Changing the system could lead to confusion and disruption, and it may be difficult to gain consensus on a new system.  While there are certainly arguments in favor of abolishing the Electoral College, I believe that the benefits of the system outweigh any potential downsides. The Electoral College provides a sense of certainty in the outcome of the election, encourages candidates to campaign throughout the country, and allows smaller states to have a greater impact on the election.  In conclusion, I strongly support the Electoral College and believe that it is an important part of our electoral system. I urge you to consider the advantages of the system and to support its continuation.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]		1
 Introduction: Driverless cars or autonomous vehicles are becoming increasingly popular in recent years, and governments and tech companies are investing billions of dollars in developing driverless cars. According to the article, driverless cars can bring about a wide range of benefits, such as reducing accidents and increasing mobility, but they also have many drawbacks, such as the displacement of jobs and the potential for increased congestion. In this essay, I will argue in favor of the development of driverless cars.  Body: Firstly, the most significant benefit of driverless cars is the potential to reduce accidents. Cars are responsible for about one million deaths worldwide each year, and human errors such as drunk driving, reckless driving, and distracted driving are significant factors in these accidents. Driverless cars are designed to prevent these mistakes and ensure that drivers follow the rules of the road, which can significantly reduce accidents and save lives. Additionally, the article notes that driverless cars can be more efficient than cars driven by humans, as they can communicate with each other and optimize routes to reduce traffic congestion.  Secondly, driverless cars can provide a level of mobility to people who may not have access to a car, such as the elderly or disabled individuals. This can improve their quality of life and provide them with more independence. Furthermore, driverless cars can increase the availability of transportation, making it easier for people to get to work or run errands.   Finally, the article notes that jobs will be displaced by the development of driverless cars. This is a legitimate concern, but it is essential to recognize that new technology often leads to the creation of new jobs. For instance, driverless cars will require skilled workers to develop and maintain them, and the article suggests that new jobs will be created in areas such as data analysis and cybersecurity.   Conclusion: In conclusion, the development of driverless cars has the potential to bring about a range of benefits, such as reducing accidents, increasing mobility, and providing new jobs. While it is essential to address concerns about job displacement and traffic congestion, the benefits of driverless cars outweigh the potential drawbacks. Driverless cars have the potential to save lives and improve the quality of life for many people, and governments and tech companies should continue to invest in their development.		1
Dear Senator,  I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I believe that this is the best way to ensure that every vote counts and that the President is elected by the majority of the people.  The Electoral College is a system in which each state is allocated a number of electors equal to the number of members it has in Congress. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district. This system has resulted in a number of instances in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election, most recently in 2016.  There are a number of reasons why I believe the Electoral College should be abolished. First, it is undemocratic. The candidate who wins the popular vote should be elected President. In the last 200 years, there have been five instances in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. This is unacceptable in a democracy.  Second, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a small number of "swing" states. This is because candidates know that they can win the election by winning the popular vote in a small number of states, even if they lose the popular vote in the country as a whole. This means that many states are essentially ignored during the campaign, and their voters have no say in who the President is.  Third, the Electoral College is unnecessary. The United States is not a federation of states, but a unitary state. The President is the President of the entire country, not just a collection of states. There is no reason why the President should be elected by a system that gives more power to some states than others.  I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President by popular vote. This is the best way to ensure that every vote counts and that the President is elected by the majority of the people.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, Your Name		1
The Development of Driverless Cars  While driverless cars present many potential advantages, I argue that developing this technology poses risks that outweigh the benefits. While the article notes driverless cars could decrease traffic accidents and increase mobility for certain groups, risks to both security and employment raise serious concerns.    One clear benefit mentioned is that driverless cars could significantly decrease accidents caused by human error or negligence. Without human flaws like intoxication or distraction, autonomous vehicles may drive more safely and obey traffic laws precisely. This could spare thousands of lives lost annually and reduce insurance costs over time. However, the technology remains unproven and many uncertainties exist. Hackers may exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems, as seen with other technologies, jeopardizing passenger safety and privacy. Mechanical failures could also potentially cause accidents currently avoided through human control and decision making.    In addition, the article predicts driverless cars could transport elderly people and enhance independence for those unable to drive. Yet widespread adoption of this technology threatens millions of jobs that currently demand human drivers. While the article acknowledges new jobs may replace some old ones, entire industries like long-haul trucking and taxi/ride-sharing services face disruption. With many workers lacking skills or opportunity for retraining, rapid transition risks damage to livelihoods. Moreover, autonomous vehicles concentrate transportation control within software and companies rather than private citizens. Some fear this could compromise individual freedom and enable new forms of surveillance.    In conclusion, while driverless cars aim to solve real problems, developing this immature technology too hastily risks safety as well as severe social costs in unemployment and lost autonomy. Further research and regulation should minimize risks before widespread adoption. Proceeding with caution could help realize benefits while avoiding potential dangers and unjust societal burdens. Overall, the issues raised give cause for serious hesitation in embracing driverless cars without prudent oversight and limitations.		1
